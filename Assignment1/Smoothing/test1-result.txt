though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his	 479.86454826246654

mrs bennet treasured up the hint and trusted that she might soon have	 186.1091424375502
protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as	 249.2516494950017

mr bennet made no answer	 3.647369077209966

curricle driving up the street elizabeth immediately recognising the	 28.593688209624982
mrs hurst was observing their game	 59.10178555088185

bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward as all	 118.07391650322518
do not you want to know who has taken it cried his wife impatiently	 274.6976863562186
this is a parade cried he which does one good it gives such an	 204.1968147579192
north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her	 694.2939091921762
not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her	 79.77527000767911
coolly will be rather a confirmation of it if indeed such a report	 421.12996900968005
down for two dances and during part of that time mr darcy had been	 536.3191479871533
that will atone for such wretchedness as this let me never see either	 158.72665716971918
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over	 260.1266391477872
all this was acknowledged to mrs gardiner and after relating the	 68.1260050731903

intelligence on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his	 327.3082695471891

coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again	 48.12762475695888
resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity	 1406.6081258994866
some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a	 1271.2996208736386
myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley	 1107.1513869443436
situation he could conjecture very little about it he must go	 268.9752499023852
i am sick of mr bingley cried his wife	 24.246267589504715
her her brothers recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his	 251.0275428034998
table in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpart of	 104.67525947312862
from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of	 282.8404068755152

we never should have got into the coach i was ready to die of laughter	 94.54806490159577
precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies	 283.1922965377113
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and	 20.24064122123047

as handsome as any of them mr bingley might like you the best of the	 653.0026747830889
wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for	 585.1580252641174
is unaccountable	 3.3903502754719876
darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from	 289.6012155052012
mrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state the very mention of any	 289.37077522015244
you i write without any intention of paining you or humbling	 119.3665773155502

my dear jane exclaimed elizabeth you are too good your sweetness	 122.92267957464223

the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind from their infancy	 742.367342582743
answered her hopes but alas the ladies had crowded round the table	 428.4467008465673
that ever made herself and her family ridiculous a flirt too in the	 327.4965548116083
her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on	 65.2193884154883
their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing	 126.52607995363577

before she leaves the south she is well and begs to be dutifully	 53.551709936714
but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike	 450.11347282961606

breeding but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to	 94.47273494039455
supposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps till the	 1939.8096213907909
too much truth the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no	 749.8357533204938
nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter	 475.61637096678606

the tumult of her mind was now painfully great she knew not how to	 22.197209965806824
if the same circumstances were to happen again i am sure i should	 433.5781975612474

more prudent i have written to colonel forster to inform him of	 10.315360924611692
my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request	 1753.53107101132
completely in your wayand if the second i can admire you much better	 173.0772276720298
friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked	 176.49359204102115
affectionately taking her hand said in reply	 142.78416962701675
heard you utter good girl it would vex me indeed to see you again	 372.1987846635046
prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished and their	 369.40258681250936
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage	 201.82490854610822
expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own	 673.7544254587227
with every particular of these transactions if your abhorrence of	 117.05821673375993
pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he	 508.78511700422547
contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those	 3.9187820502067154
looked the gentleman but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attention	 956.9234660991374
i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were	 195.79212691843634
of discourse proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the	 260.4316292919876
she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said	 836.9038415054946
you are uniformly charming cried he with an air of awkward	 49.72614491867241
look on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when	 126.5461724466346
children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago	 598.282459001018
any thing to deserve to lose it i have a warm unguarded temper and i	 63.247617549238655
admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard	 242.69743828568488
of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter	 646.429052942374
lydias intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten every sister	 707.3656993326965
elizabeth tried to join in her fathers pleasantry but could only force	 70.58830281213945
her eyes	 13.949857124846487
i do not blame jane she continued for jane would have got mr	 376.11183254353097
purses i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and i am sure i	 591.3143506975584
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i	 250.9677019892516
seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the	 315.5558934373373
could not be seen and mr darcy found on further enquiry that	 230.4984502750978
child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my	 162.4852272957252
collection despite these efforts project gutenbergtm electronic	 14.139373385902749
been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same	 397.4116546191131
is nothing the matter with me i am quite well i am only distressed by	 215.68672024406695
way his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her	 198.29785730307364
interested you because i was so unlike them had you not been really	 630.7034916524083
were engaged jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her	 53.4039598330693
gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party but	 388.95034978342284
the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants	 1982.0335298310379
her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any	 411.8825422037973
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict	 4.0202887737551185
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than	 94.06180922942697
character could be capable of it can his most intimate friends be so	 1050.028251009276
for the welfare of his friend	 3.7509698781303724
removal was soon evident lady catherine had been rendered so	 170.31473681362417
after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words	 530.2943639454879
charlotte again and weakened her disgust of mr collins there was	 98.73498291377786
too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a	 146.939804015289
to improve myself for in my situation of life mrs philips was	 281.0788286501622
shortly relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by	 337.095309367534
dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all	 66.57502668981662
expose himself to such a man mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained	 62.39365843868196
it he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention	 612.1344559279918
some slight observation on the dance he replied and was again silent	 1095.5269712435183
but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus	 139.8567345504396
dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading	 705.9071830856337
jane on their first arrival at lambton and this disappointment had	 294.9123483034766
influencing his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been	 458.1340835061897
diningroom elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take	 834.2834930662076
because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party	 352.6160365823435
and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry did he know of	 1380.4724136690263
the compliment of such a mans affection and though her intentions did	 156.52417375360764
chapter xxi	 1.9160620946979579
very undeserving young manand i do not suppose there is the least	 150.1426041283599
electronic work you indicate that you have read understand agree to	 303.22865244620215
mrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her	 56.07788177310033
when her mother went up to her dressingroom at night she followed her	 69.0492667678032
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible advice which there	 136.2845737325423
we are not in a way to know what mr bingley likes said her mother	 115.65832163014967
was her business to be satisfiedand certainly her temper to be happy	 522.4272504886774
the summer a most welcome negative followed the last questionand her	 518.4606293669309
expect a renewal of his love is there one among the sex who would not	 480.85028048071376
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which	 35.45342098895422
otherwise explained	 60.37337928980733
the evening passed quietly unmarked by any thing extraordinary the	 69.18457709484407
back her ladyship was highly incensed	 397.4150084964058
suspicions of the impertinent she mentioned this to her friend miss	 73.3448106915228
beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake	 532.3621345463479
and at length they began to know the officers themselves mr philips	 245.8103348622499
from the public domain does not contain a notice indicating that it is	 85.45187081449893
asked in the course of the evening elizabeth reserved to herself the	 107.31756610410346
condition	 1.919964484944678
which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure i	 303.39549447877346
may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer	 525.7175803081582
i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left	 367.51680701980894
future niece nor could she think without a smile of what her	 359.3332063488297

suiting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at	 62.50091809474187
is this thought elizabeth meant for me and she coloured at the	 206.605452025954
reason for what she did for mr collins would undoubtedly have been	 204.00593508288273
meant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too	 610.5788321874625
cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on	 413.8199416278616
entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the	 171.89737253967766
mr bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way you take	 121.37094996472372
we are speaking of music madam said he when no longer able to avoid	 447.1746295187256
evening said elizabeth the conduct of neither if strictly examined	 413.82629636831604
in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to mrs	 108.04358731805925
elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon	 52.38583165821344
established him at once in the possession of every virtue she tried to	 63.27334122791862
my dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this point	 521.5005558581671
are not your own	 116.23655131367322
satisfactory to tell you mr bingley does not know the whole of his	 30.57126235702299
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although	 126.23419069911347
to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea	 493.5110582589252
assure you there are many amiable young women but the fact is that	 183.02452893411254
one of them does	 53.36625242924855
prepared to admire them at present i will not say more but perhaps	 326.04803507921423
necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence	 284.35388142765873
i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of	 214.275421272454
what a charming amusement for young people this is mr darcythere	 312.9377061158705
foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day	 18.007839886152077
things though the words are often used synonimously a person may be	 898.1614380903957
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked it was	 176.62938758539687
very welland this offer of marriage you have refused	 105.73601573351715
very greatly to my happiness and thirdlywhich perhaps i ought to have	 347.39751881264954
commendation to think of her as he chose	 104.19131405512307
and doubt as to the occasions justifying her coming so far alone the	 481.03112166460255
credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more	 301.50536629761905
darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily	 519.318258802777
passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too	 153.0820116556877
my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong	 230.35252506632835
any thing else fatigued as she had been by the mornings walk they had	 200.74354295856227
arrested herand she beheld a striking resemblance of mr darcy with	 11.344593419938075
the first exclamations of surprise and horror mr gardiner readily	 161.35191832855585
enjoyment like reading how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a	 771.7408918172607
intimate confidential friend mr darcy often acknowledged himself to	 271.662253485487
he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the	 398.4234396521667

springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the	 220.48300843651117
this is quite shockinghe deserves to be publicly disgraced	 31.37074883557166
no indeed i felt nothing but surprise	 150.61487828401712
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real	 425.9489922826278
poultry and all their dependent concerns had not yet lost their	 132.31333304045796
boy	 1.919964484944678
elizabeth was summoned to dinner to the civil enquiries which then	 204.2253828678813
darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right you have employed your	 280.05739150783944
withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which	 232.31485819174682
rosings a lively imagination soon settled it all	 380.70627507891265
its contents but such as they were it may be well supposed how eagerly	 839.8639151673566
significant look and smile from mrs annesley to miss darcy had been	 210.0418209708858
of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at	 859.8019524802771
much wretched wretched mistake	 3.8214796268587223
which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room and	 101.18547821670943
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value	 436.35034365017157
pemberley	 3.7994876060429856
gloomy elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it her power	 330.26747879915735
i am sure i know none so handsome but in the gallery up stairs you	 140.97990330844755
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room from thence to the	 139.32884787653683
i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with	 215.28128221017715
collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of	 177.98694295758474
dear lizzy	 4.658784067335748
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in	 83.17717641341355

but it had not been so in derbyshire there he had talked to her	 188.3857330459893
mr bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia	 119.66620292767729
slightest suspicion i told him moreover that i believed myself	 54.12790531825062
he put his letter into her hand she knew not what to think nor how to	 513.8493943375187
would judge differently in the affair	 614.0811456178743
i will make no promise of the kind	 54.182727294535596

reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon	 124.35313156753514
ignorant of the truth myself and when i returned home the shire	 543.5782516616795
oh it is of no consequence i shall see her in january but do you	 460.53069462202524
her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate	 193.24458976422326
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane	 317.6623971124269
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own but	 236.21368169029734

it is difficult indeedit is distressingone does not know what to	 28.140581560803824
the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of	 335.19350523514254
me we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our	 366.1113911781753
sir williams interruption has made me forget what we were talking of	 361.3701674337403
looked that way	 144.92052234738614
spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt	 104.14290726582023
so speedy a return immediately said	 56.54369323026013
an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr	 229.5940017598742

elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards	 138.97449479038022
we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest	 92.36206362628266
regimentals	 1.919964484944678

the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or	 242.1004198148366
and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his	 121.43976236585051
to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was	 546.7404267202593
mr bennet replied that he had not	 13.037893728385885
this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss	 667.1514224647701
all the unhappiness she had brought on her family if she heard me	 262.3355787805692
you have said quite enough madam i perfectly comprehend your	 595.085130966867
heard and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as	 108.06290678560484
good and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered	 250.9044426722113
for the truth of every thing here related i can appeal more	 51.69564133455525
secret mrs bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs philips and	 23.29907519054783
wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him but though	 288.27170521711514
he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle	 65.34606167410362
person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered	 28.863385868262956
people he knew but he had never seen any thing but affability in her	 134.95244384729511
mr darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving	 56.072479683043504
should not have known her again	 44.65459944963178
congratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly	 132.18300428470283
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was	 146.31338449980356
defects such as but not limited to incomplete inaccurate or	 34.572038941877544
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other	 166.17644617458672

nobody feels for my poor nerves	 175.14268500588503
renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting	 455.251163376142
in company with either of them their society can afford no pleasure	 345.58907089791484
it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be	 18.486054043322643
them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her	 584.2081269215086
unpardonable i cannot think of it without abhorrence	 12.406230845203943
with her himself attended to her conversation with others his doing so	 961.7562416869723
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings	 31.97758153403877
happy i am sure i shant get a wink of sleep all night i knew how it	 186.56477370393765

after this day jane said no more of her indifference not a word passed	 958.5179709603711
seriously to work to find it outshe watched him whenever they were at	 436.4887680856564
is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at	 546.1490435541161
another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his	 312.6748325943447
letter to mrs f gave them to understand that they were going to	 88.5014852199828

<NUMBER> to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt	 188.7577737317634
or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she	 113.67915124686357
she made no answer	 41.381189696992415
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases	 125.15901098496587

was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting both changed colour	 391.2420697985827
that is to say you had given your permission i guessed as much and	 718.1417937344324
shape of a lover to any of them she began at length to recover to	 107.0334495323101
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous	 119.21011887674166
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to	 157.26131290336298
they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was	 122.78045449785145
doubt i suppose of their being really married	 745.3658559053978
nay if you are so serious about it i shall consider the matter as	 306.0160414149739
conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her	 130.09327974156471

reynolds could interest her on no other point she related the subject	 526.2990854076503
happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a	 208.02383536262812
something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had	 575.126202331533
are two things that i want very much to knowone is how much money	 1286.5375218375755

disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to	 751.1686000330409
suddenly addressed her with	 74.43329731849329
conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the	 849.5487367358046
the picture gallery and two or three of the principal bedrooms were	 186.30793450816947

long outdone by jane now is your time here are officers enough at	 888.1262798208742

ought to have i should think you could not do better but as it isyou	 297.26100038044376
mrs hurst and her sister allowed it to be sobut still they admired	 319.7042674897907
pemberley woods with some perturbation and when at length they turned	 29.67321058958768
elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great	 172.86609239221787
of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself	 133.89911662327714
nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all	 688.5182839227218
herself on saturday i shall walk to meryton tomorrow to hear more	 336.4408012426149
stairs these two girls had been above an hour in the place happily	 754.0234201259074
this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on	 412.044655149426
united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine	 262.1018137529968
estate whenever it falls without any selfreproach this matter may be	 471.8369292557767
yes she will remain there till christmas	 111.50365172857508
regulated in so small a family as hers and instructed her as to the	 79.8579735603774
so many months so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all	 115.21192960727575
had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday several of	 556.9250751640097

together after a short silence the lady first spoke she wished him to	 132.22004560845227
regulars thank heaven he has some friends though perhaps not so	 811.1277587951756
depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both	 132.59009734692597
bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn	 184.28617185646638
i never can be thankful mr bennet for any thing about the entail	 67.95436395468919
and wish him all manner of evil but my feelings are not only cordial	 1126.3492934530836
to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival of jane no look appeared	 334.0326909560122
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on	 276.74949244293265
hope and i was determined at once to know every thing	 175.47449430436194
i was surprised to see darcy in town last month we passed each other	 432.24057532825645
morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her	 40.073591344160036
directly	 4.282525768021001
i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william	 354.2292865838576

i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my	 38.69159138663716
for my own part she rejoined i must confess that i never could see	 109.89214659189949

lines as for your elizabeths picture you must not attempt to have it	 356.1173926018062
in confirming or crushing it steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke	 146.22951046553234
collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydias sad	 67.65540973217352
parting between the friends elizabeth was attended to the carriage by	 470.85151423026076
not before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she sat down	 604.2125222985865
