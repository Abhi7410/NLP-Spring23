miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a	 3.8240940480067227
before anybody else however your coming just at this time is the	 3.29058908824975
from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to	 3.8830685695520173
when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose	 3.606449063136247
within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so	 3.828998165920315
yours sincerely c	 3.513993579978472
opinion my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light	 3.819102688801427
on his cousin allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with	 3.7687874490831375
will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved	 3.89640383241789
far from going away turned back with them and entered into	 3.0624725466498437
there were other evils before her she anticipated what would be felt in	 3.4470404266505925
what none of you	 3.660135382741107
subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left	 3.7211621156051855
hours now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship	 4.336126336012685
have as little trouble in the business as possible when the first	 3.667445175683055
their premeditated contempt i have therefore made up my mind to tell	 2.9758386525458884
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of	 3.5874716855868045
hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill	 3.688442364529497
i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise	 3.0823003599022094
in this interference from what she had said of her resolution to	 3.815651992503149
let mr collins and me have a little conversation together	 4.24223530052631
yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight do	 3.108294283666305
in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence elizabeth made no	 3.3999764217778496
in general are not more like her does she live near you sir	 3.059637354106988
i certainly shall not you know how i detest it unless i am	 3.680861599822048
and so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the house	 2.747669955584522
whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if i	 3.478134006762801
gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing	 3.9301007138419966
making any answer she went on as before	 3.6933112228142035
peculiarities has abilities which mr darcy himself need not disdain	 3.7662345517394473
by mrs hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey and	 3.9295267549520863
and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would	 3.6986347482266004
collins much offended laid aside his book and said	 5.115689742509376
spiritless by the illsuccess of all their endeavours he had yielded to	 4.283637641271912
chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr collins	 3.682238173609471
think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly	 3.5237184600828018
certainly but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most	 4.819655136621204
the poor family pride and filial pride for he is very proud of what	 3.8663875035047615
could have the advantage of a london master she has a very good notion	 3.55976295091146
are your uncles and aunts do not imagine me ignorant of their	 3.537768663063141
house where they were to remain a few days	 5.1387251223550034
mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of	 3.9365733869879644
wickham and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr darcys	 4.098487349867972
no indeed i did noti knew nothing at all of lady catherines	 3.572328602839395
father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the	 3.610134828967916
lace upon mrs hursts gown	 3.6502797216008664
mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during	 3.1103933024300536
she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited	 4.6804834771369235
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a	 4.7452466671176206
disgrace him he had been some days in town before he was able to	 3.833027053109343
heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage and had come to	 3.396858906513121
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful	 3.4522737362394214
not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins she could not help asking	 4.29985665674418
when the teathings were removed and the card tables placed the ladies	 5.262696896490013
either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to	 4.66490112804612

smiles for you are wasting your time with me	 4.138210363011686
me but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well	 3.7189189140455503
very wellthat reply will do for the presentperhaps by and bye i	 4.370911037495083
and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every	 4.714604367045266
hours of separation that must sometimes occur in the absence of jane	 4.826258510290947
but if that is the case you must write to your mother to beg that you	 3.501030888025014
you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of	 3.6081905117669764
between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr philipss	 3.7010878775815628
is a shade in a character but you have chosen your fault welli	 5.1259263334023135
perfectly soi thank you	 3.4050277139135656
of happiness were within thirty miles of each other	 3.5485785668718086
amiable and pleasing	 3.8653320635881054
her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their	 3.4808092544422755
if i were you	 3.2085462612001434
can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this this young	 3.414214494013254
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed	 3.2091909054823478
personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield which was	 3.2906683418606515
disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to	 4.495207988037403
were remarkably well done and i suppose he has two or three french	 3.148173409932251
without one of her sisters	 4.281926647942382
dear madam cried mrs hill in great astonishment dont you know	 3.7556251915213457
they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while	 4.972289160465361
they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i	 5.505093442814608
his daughters request for such it might be considered of being	 3.4304440173818516
to escape she added lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing	 4.488737433541712
london	 3.098152596139606
thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on	 3.2174490691443944
was not in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it in	 4.109705463983718
would perhaps be called resentfulmy good opinion once lost is lost	 3.346322052797742
consented as she went up stairs to get ready mrs bennet followed her	 3.046158320269544
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his	 5.253616451242847
them	 2.779467724834706
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again the principal	 3.3125285299286853
elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said	 3.1926463418763955
herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very	 3.816165431416537
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper but i am	 4.384028351333028
to suggest some herselfsome shelves in the closets up stairs	 4.806141741613189
voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for	 4.580387896708352
dinner when the engagement was for home some of the officers always	 3.8397901897337547
mr collins on his return highly gratified mrs bennet by admiring mrs	 3.1306003230711874
widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant	 3.9752236711995277
temper she could not contribute much to my felicity	 4.59787020458229
if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to	 3.959587175329292
once from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day	 3.8714481981125877
conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with	 3.493123992725166
of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made every thing worse	 3.2963761786079
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in	 4.064799917656955
the impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn	 3.2412388287418112
former residence and where she had lately learned that some	 3.6341482977933763
i hope not	 3.0572420327676366
in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make	 3.2217452303810385
longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could	 3.4786493528148146
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at	 3.7866290599431895
bennet instantly answered	 3.5956563979391403
i am not likely to leave kent for some time promise me therefore to	 3.2627328160750033
youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of	 3.6903712579403125
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink the	 4.555216318744404
most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it	 3.839293713986854
returning to netherfield again of giving up the house but not	 3.050873726575311
parsonage	 4.246120383597698
i beg you would not put it into lizzys head to be vexed by his	 3.6951151016788955
occasion no one was to be put in competition with him he did every	 4.945454633613584
her better judgment at my expence when i confess myself to have	 3.4364463232711158
a conceited pompous narrowminded silly man you know he is as well	 4.004751324619793
first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds	 3.0765173669018835
morning to answering it as i foresee that a little writing will	 4.758830885323252
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as	 2.848564501694386
oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him	 3.0490896502180327
enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting	 3.108036124124341
trouble of finding a subject to him	 3.908097975237992
their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt	 3.8169162714026355
moment or are the result of previous study	 3.5972304788496023
given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a good	 4.242615672764172
the dupe of miss bingleys pretended regard	 3.691842396976595
church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it	 4.362275767377228
my dear miss eliza why are not you dancingmr darcy you must allow	 3.211797835811916
opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind one may be continually	 4.283654744652963
received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the	 4.683814176157958
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to	 3.526448515543944
somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have	 4.10577414877358
were by themselves how strange this is and for this we are to be	 3.2482136416270957
between distress and diversion mrs bennet and kitty walked off and as	 3.991202653436267
she is my youngest girl but one my youngest of all is lately married	 3.113105889875571
rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to	 3.258560512604535
well well and so mr bingley is coming down sister for mrs	 3.3659137773863628
for she will not know him herself	 3.9707121213107213
wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with	 3.900996311550967
marriage he shook his head when i expressed my hopes and said he	 3.295627004559399
he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of	 3.610772356858859
softened its impropriety of expression	 3.7481742953680794
turn about the roomi assure you it is very refreshing after sitting	 3.977267145464815
to say no other apology to offer if i have wounded your sisters	 4.393209620316894
forster looked very becoming the other night at sir williams in his	 3.8367586566849443
conversation with the ladies and sir william to elizabeths high	 3.0955024430158318
surprise the greater when i write to them and sign my name lydia	 3.657616703931526
instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for	 5.000509921327472
music for there are certainly other things to be attended to the	 3.1546061646921326
you may depend on it replied the other for mrs nicholls was in	 3.3865392767009013
arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets and jane more especially	 4.251172573885879
send but even of that they would have been glad to be certain mr	 4.385244752388736
saying	 4.0120894381314605
your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome our situation	 3.25837178238567
father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have	 3.8581642044491073
duplicity in all this but i will endeavour to banish every painful	 4.219305003674368
almost took from me my faculties	 3.6340353111669206
pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel	 4.085896394152979
why should you be surprised my dear elizado you think it incredible	 3.7316924485655116
ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject mr	 3.257779451923948
in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow	 4.003641995447293
expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present	 3.914193269434613
your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you my mind was more	 3.9254573056614204
give him a good name some people call him proud but i am sure i never	 3.5782550983609993
the business nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt	 3.671306986648998

it out but i hardly know what i have written	 3.7651453758380065

you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew	 3.4872875702600945

mr gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from	 3.279679903763708
elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time mr bingleys	 3.712332590658518

too long and too well to be a fair judge it is impossible for me to	 3.5957932144832325
we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that	 4.003624440597194
how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his	 3.787244290634668

and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it	 4.2963020870674935
this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently	 3.9845341301362347

he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped to interrupt	 5.17135571419285
impertinence your uncle is as much surprised as i amand nothing	 3.6721168161126068
was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was	 3.277746842831048

drop added he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i	 4.300408637860671
able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that	 4.210755780125086

in any other person present the supposition did not pain her she liked	 3.637551850954282

for your sakes we would do any thing lydia my love though you are	 3.6378337322599616
he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down	 3.3828282158162577
enough to say before how much i like him his behaviour to us has	 3.375472721100753
chance of it	 2.776979705732847
darcys character though he had assured her that respect for the	 3.6292159986966186
mother you quite mistook mr darcy he only meant that there were not	 3.9518748405287316
forget because they were not immediately before methese causes	 3.803167088189431
to the windowshe lookedshe saw mr darcy with him and sat down	 4.77123189137904
he chose fordyces sermons lydia gaped as he opened the volume and	 3.923072802463908
agreed in wishing for the sake of their sisters feelings and	 3.6718657866272193
but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of	 3.489033869199125
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by	 4.1401916874832505
mrs gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late mr darcy by	 3.277538907340865
disconcerted she could not imagine what business he could have in town	 3.400477411723391
and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own	 5.199549550872658

yes sir i know i am if i was to go through the world i could not	 3.895091313657211
she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see	 3.569394004198093
of his friend for though jane had the most generous and forgiving	 3.968794508848624
of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of	 3.4089116592454523
of her life	 3.6218988762113353
he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when	 3.5289528824768177
ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself she	 3.8620829121112727
they walked on without knowing in what direction there was too much to	 4.137957355918497
his character was decided he was the proudest most disagreeable man in	 4.350295953828299
mutually silent on the subject and elizabeth felt persuaded that no	 4.112857214126236
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give	 3.7003631610038865
his constancy if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might	 3.817787274185408
spirits increased she longed to see mrs philips the lucases and all	 4.548207027765065
and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently there has	 4.160168646495067
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt	 3.5739123311062855
which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider	 4.522036220067149
the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have	 4.783639914402865
and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wickham his	 3.7534777403124084
you may as well call it impertinence at once it was very little less	 3.704398893465441
surmount even in speaking to mr bingley whose blind partiality	 3.6886691840082273
new instrument just come down for hera present from my master she	 3.3085209339868493
of a fine stout healthy love it may every thing nourishes what is	 3.8878113287790894
evident enough	 4.514558040356266
1e8 you may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing	 3.708704018242111
together can doubt his affection miss bingley i am sure cannot she is	 3.781946061964877
charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her	 3.245064320126878
oh well it is just as he chooses nobody wants him to come though i	 3.9526606044301626
with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her	 4.7866158116819655
abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most	 4.186577042220243
acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming	 3.7368947828382417
elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked	 3.8310517510003734
young woman in the countrybut it was not till the evening of the	 4.154642716238164
creature who would have thought she could be so thin and small	 5.091956300927809
requited their taking her home and affording her their personal	 3.8355558115875734
some time or other he will bebut it shall not be by me till i	 3.6175833112998013
same time maintained you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates	 4.225884402836704
blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the	 3.511708994480668
them but so it is it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted	 4.316661216999723
or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and commiseration	 3.8787496123729124
due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to	 4.288529204224808
imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must	 3.204232524182602
avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally	 3.289350580408506
you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you	 3.743860418447927
catherine would not come in again and rest herself	 3.3958450213510516
evening by the bye mrs forster and me are such friends and so	 4.090512586717937
think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements	 3.3394185489737467
father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand	 3.339765668538761
shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday	 4.005500648789817

precluding the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their	 3.4647016450584434
due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which	 3.354619136481547
before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise mrs	 4.076050731807347
elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference	 3.7814735779603312
principle	 1.919964484944678
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast	 4.313550055093873
affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for	 3.2987957479038417
discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly	 4.539438624674666
and quite alone have all her friends left her	 3.548636131145456
fathers life time	 3.70375569786957
perfect as plan could be	 3.8835432814150983
bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away	 3.3069712476926276
though he was now established only as a tenant miss bingley was by no	 4.424100404465155
she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of	 5.209824684599595
she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out she	 3.6322448351765355
cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my	 4.10850149132202

retailing them all to the younger miss lucases and lydia in a voice	 3.4447620667907395
oh yesthe handsomest young lady that ever was seen and so	 2.9980822815867914
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr darcy had been was much	 4.134233724815561
appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight their eyes	 3.4381786652338575
every object in the next days journey was new and interesting to	 3.213934545331652
i hope you will consent to be of the party indeed eliza you will be	 3.562175304729254
but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely	 3.4686690828608993
than felt herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment	 3.8402498060873143
have you any other objection said elizabeth than your belief of my	 2.8581710934347266
father though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was really	 4.34671020791218
affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence	 3.242912831552543
he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walked towards	 3.477846647394335
oh your father of course may spare you if your mother candaughters	 3.7304899285431845
we will go round the park every day i am the happiest creature in	 3.0590261626051896
with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she	 2.9465633880297775
in darcys breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her	 3.3740593958224094
dependence	 1.919964484944678
that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring	 3.412413659325218
know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the	 4.105546250036057
signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however	 3.333012742964806

amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds	 3.364694199772693
it it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence	 4.6000011196293125
was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the	 3.6324753302725936
waitingwoman was in it they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk	 4.754465601701497
conversation with mr gardiner elizabeth could not but be pleased	 3.3541042547300863
all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day	 3.3148361107834425
he was the admirer of some one else elizabeth was watchful enough to	 3.9140405559648612
into the regulars and among his former friends there are still	 3.831664296700194
will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write againat	 3.3807487425585108
pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more	 4.553462777721808
soon after this event	 3.5670364595401445
if we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we may	 3.2832445316321115
such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to	 3.1772641780521904
times widely different when she remembered the style of his address	 5.361130413888881
and have you answered the letter said elizabeth	 3.122444972353413
him	 3.04894376021173
surprised you could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within	 3.589439501624731

all took place miss bingleys civility to elizabeth increased at last	 3.2587274867022358
no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former	 4.7310378037880945
satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made	 3.518134071979694
in any doubt of your sisters sentiments he has heartily forgiven me	 3.711564460441658
set off together bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to	 3.5214684952615
but my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is miss king i	 3.270382396384047
no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to	 3.5447553687128583
waved for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his	 3.742976970950889
and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters	 3.279517003159387
thing and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two	 4.678886780297338
her voice was weak and her manner affectedelizabeth was in agonies	 4.982270256978873
cold luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have	 4.77465069702026
after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows	 3.5265072591112245
only one who shed tears but she did weep from vexation and envy mrs	 5.529293409373763
herself when her father continued	 3.6715059461453032
such a striking civility as miss darcys in coming to them on the very	 3.5085147824210687
and respectability which he will probably never reach when she thought	 4.0027714800474445
every possible enquiry on that side london colonel f came on into	 3.694151931929845
himself	 3.0106300027651467
gathering her work together she was hastening away when elizabeth	 4.213273197803986
see that your reproofs had been attended to how soon any other wishes	 3.9438509776932253

that	 3.3284243386163204
cookery was owing but here he was set right by mrs bennet who assured	 3.600729051350227

impartialitydeliberated on the probability of each statementbut with	 3.8842800985007435
words to her sister ran out of the room	 3.507095241533056

good lord sir william how can you tell such a storydo not you know	 4.293350652977782
because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement	 3.9253915193471425
she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself and to	 3.4950568913382103
the house	 2.871454832750351
for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a great	 4.012467722379493
you take an eager interest in that gentlemans concerns said darcy in	 4.429830319339573
felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as	 3.827894880357442
himself agreeable no where and who had not thought her handsome enough	 3.616312217857618
she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down he	 4.244551309556227
sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips	 4.22347609474537
had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they	 3.7622468659753467
enough to drive happiness away	 3.4888449727211523
compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been	 3.7397611936111868
suspicion certainly not in your inclination you may possibly	 3.3933511740887905
as to a real strong attachment pray how violent was mr bingleys	 3.295865480545035
thank you for explaining it so fully my faults according to this	 4.833390141140448

and it was done for the beston this subject i have nothing more	 4.522893726238129
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this	 4.4216741615997135
their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance	 3.8506255887706597

great opposition of characterbingley was endeared to darcy by the	 4.820074441699931
he is gone i never saw such a long chin in my life well but now for	 3.569660423143092
in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised	 4.517963283637743
tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of	 3.4830324055737054
is my father in town	 3.2958363201303222
words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible	 4.0774402527428215
but he added you will of course wish to have your humble respects	 3.2891830965918345
liberal	 1.919964484944678
recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the	 3.9019630572758266
has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise	 3.5099900669361865
him after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged with	 3.705836671734865
most disagreeable such were the gentle murmurs of mrs bennet and they	 4.529668589586599
occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man	 5.114893124493554
i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a	 3.2455828189794955
apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments	 5.114434596939283
bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that	 3.7692546354987573
my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you	 4.600288067351877
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts she was not sorry however to	 3.847237492963316
hours learn to think of it less than incessantly lady catherine it	 4.056170593850521
could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings	 4.279818612559572
i should be so reasonable as to admit it but i wonder how long you	 4.63061794402385
noi feel he may defy us there and as to laughter we will not expose	 4.127817828472098
know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a	 4.659663232955366
inquiries on the same subject of bingley jane met her with a smile of	 3.406715272490555
indifference continued to express her admiration of captain carter and	 3.8819146609817285
he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage	 2.914304020050997
be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance i dearly love a	 3.223317815500549
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of	 3.276634110246183
goodnaturedly engaged mr collinss conversation to herself	 3.2643525228447743
make an offer to me	 3.7898547893569865
woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in	 4.30187772434176
let me first see how he behaves said she it will then be early	 3.4094350142723147
the full project gutenberg license	 4.1969261563731175
offensive to his patron he must write his own sermons and the time	 4.858643978232956
nor can i find there was any intention of being so but if you are	 3.513412137238071

of my fellow creatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it	 4.267517544220411
for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the	 3.278133767282599
elsewhere	 1.919964484944678
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the	 3.306473911983995
sake of what had been rather than what was charlottes first letters	 3.628888277156278
dying an old maid charlotte herself was tolerably composed she had	 3.392060162804035
information and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the	 5.428710841987783
in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away	 3.039326314802338
we may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as	 3.7025761652881872
considered how many peoples happiness were in his guardianshiphow	 3.7741947698271368
what he had related himself and the kindness of the late mr darcy	 3.1852075485360114
and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street where mr	 3.759613689747134
relief	 4.3979672005962005
then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said mrs	 3.4573690496466636
as well as greater certainty absence had increased her desire of seeing	 3.360266431254278
he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes and	 4.427050339231077
had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as	 3.1414918114538986
would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the	 3.5838463673860694
if do you then pretend to be ignorant of it has it not been	 4.168327864228142
exaggeration the shocking rudeness of mr darcy	 3.1133586717308868
to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it but	 3.6874095858079365
consolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress it	 4.727426450166872

expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would	 3.8755743410809917
estate and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility and	 3.7058439557132425

did you admire me for my impertinence	 3.5636022850610285
could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the	 3.3389267980336435

two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal	 4.278958249329498
in darcys presence she dared not mention wickhams name but elizabeth	 3.1899643765441823
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes to	 4.078437662139696

not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr	 5.212017176972499
manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she	 5.154051030612417

little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit	 4.336960930488243

nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn	 4.775259344379425

darcy you cannot deny the fact	 4.0509320357200975
into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on	 4.32674230312317
lydia was a stout wellgrown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion	 5.466877349116615
declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business	 3.714735623625914
next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and	 3.7719474278748386
of her sisters were uttered without being heard	 3.222240946681782
i do not knowi hope there wasbut to be guarded at such a time is	 3.7821613109587138
pride prejudice	 2.7743631503306823
it was a subject which they could not mention before me	 3.4082354783895816
no it would have been strange if they had but i make no doubt they	 4.05231498148887
i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth but it ought to	 3.2755947035230735
remained with no very cordial feelings towards him she told the story	 3.6053371847290734
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work	 3.324428624795085
she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh and trusting their	 3.3451621198632067
weight i may suffer from the want of money younger sons cannot marry	 3.2636891231491294
both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great	 3.859404718989863
and her sister just returned from their walk the têteàtête surprised	 3.275261168041419
the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just	 3.2616511863306066
my dear brother	 3.471054432122959
imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often	 3.317271645583289
yes where else can they be so well concealed	 3.4062420968003955
ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrouled oh my dear father can you	 3.4535313293096146
is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth we are	 4.166556767412794
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained	 4.006127778227757
very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone	 4.001126496433475
neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the	 4.810436674464123
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation	 4.0854495249196034
that you should come together oh he is the handsomest young man that	 3.833897394496453
trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold againbut their	 3.651688472722394
longbourn the children two girls of six and eight years old and two	 4.285741461722372
that her daughter would be married was enough she was disturbed by no	 4.0586966161696045
letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not	 4.002006063639816
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do	 3.877631700338317
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy himself but	 3.9370016619556405
my dearest child she cried i can think of nothing else ten	 3.249258717038724
elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her fathers speech was afraid	 3.804094942069311
disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some	 3.5020054722464105
views on the stranger would be disappointed but he soon found that he	 4.696081723876216
effect	 3.6410297350275913
that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was	 3.3709763512934146
perhaps that is not possible for any one but it has been the study of	 3.9255856993853246
flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be	 3.23394070939517
not object to them they can be nothing to you	 3.774037447180109
yes there can for mine is totally differentwill you hear it	 4.1418513865285265
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery	 3.4910317015652534
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during	 4.377776539053217
what i think	 3.6939712427212257
head and sat down without saying a word elizabeth had mentioned her	 3.254236061123613
i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her	 3.6164529001910095
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that	 3.658955847489445
of this hereafter if you should have no objection to receive me	 3.9172113864748392
politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place	 3.3750571651850163
unless a copyright notice is included thus we do not necessarily	 3.133071491930399
such a flutter that i am sure i cant write so i will dictate and you	 4.51900459075441
they were all astonished and mr bennet who could by no means wish for	 3.8129438991510205
absolutely settled you will have a charming motherinlaw indeed and	 3.9682936783960296
pay	 1.919964484944678
during their walk it was resolved that mr bennets consent should be	 3.3154681782418436
whatever my connections may be said elizabeth if your nephew does	 3.4773812147522345
she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to	 3.5172868917471236

do you certainly leave kent on saturday said she	 3.1381424355775906
indeed	 3.939753772131623
in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to	 3.9593649101248647
patronage yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin	 3.8291645545599824
conversation	 3.9501699853775825
dependence when have you been prevented by want of money from going	 3.1935540603126977
exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them because wickham has	 3.5052897254150155
this account then is what he has received from mr darcy i am	 3.399252377390133
gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off	 3.7091634980527046
this will not do said elizabeth you never will be able to make both	 3.8288853452615825
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his	 3.5036390144109073

all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her	 4.154423842521448
some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it	 3.987334597197402
to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must soon	 3.3940496491110883

received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be	 4.469276787630552

standing about by yourself in this stupid manner you had much better	 3.7009067550608044

to expect him here soon lydia left a few lines for his wife	 3.8938750237481714
she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly	 4.339979482737465

with the family and with a bow to mr darcy he concluded his speech	 4.377364511143652

do you prefer reading to cards said he that is rather singular	 3.5512165405281575
unassuming and gentle elizabeth who had expected to find in her as	 3.642160904232981
he disliked her was still more strange she could only imagine however	 4.068996235801862
up with her but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody	 3.614866471921373
therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his	 3.6055057162296027

what had happened at netherfield she read with an eagerness which	 3.7246144496423716
convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said	 4.154649165471412
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish	 3.846903775660567
mrs bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some	 3.392784161001355

encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the	 4.763851192704472
the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect	 3.3235736868941173
silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her mr	 5.098902797434213

elizabeth said	 3.383235929800817
i am sure why janeyou never dropt a word of this you sly thing	 3.4892086780585645
all and then wickham would be angry	 3.2596359486956814
was not conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to	 3.642373772452995
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told	 5.317637527954152
that parish and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven	 3.376936279861141
i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied	 3.293330446592129
inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her every time	 3.5085675322409107
by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend	 3.920629265838115
it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon	 3.4851610713178185
bennet	 3.280932793844843
representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and	 4.097803779442774
be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done	 4.8846706232262695
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity	 3.329506082462285
superscripted characters are enclosed by curly brackets	 4.298704089586267
can i suppose her so lost to every thingimpossible i grieve to	 3.4630535770574453
nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned	 3.7090891870782303
she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton	 3.4232205088870544
their sisters wedding day arrived and jane and elizabeth felt for her	 3.4987183283553915
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections	 3.628377224292721
disengaged he never came near enough to speak she felt it to be the	 3.7423769863981717
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight	 4.642873081611951
deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the power of	 3.555586304134133
collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much	 4.061465368548297
vacant there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds his own	 3.7637447839061635
deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is	 3.906970157895817
spoken so sensibly and observed in a halfwhisper to lady lucas that	 5.742864243414327
made her perhaps almost as happy as jane she saw her in idea settled in	 3.1863515940499925
former favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she saw	 3.8697662967265973
her sister for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper	 3.2027898830325072
elizabeth privately added and how much i shall have to conceal	 3.6736201262917145
mr collins had only to change from jane to elizabethand it was soon	 4.211563346373706
subject of tenderness than of pride his sense of her inferiorityof	 3.710446575389824
feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them my temper	 4.031210527125514
mother you deserve no such attention i am most seriously displeased	 3.242064957227859
but consider your daughters only think what an establishment it would	 3.6589648985794274
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday senight	 3.858894749759555
gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before	 4.942765091117449
tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and	 3.8326101445214507
there seemed an embargo on every subject at last she recollected that	 3.8358345525711104
by one spirit every thing relating to their journey was speedily	 4.297284801335746
power of reading again i can remember some expressions which might	 3.2729301790452205
their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and	 3.084540716328138
his affection might be reanimated and the influence of his friends	 4.988024542640456
join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but	 4.273637549354056
yes replied wickhamhis estate there is a noble one a clear ten	 3.3067540147615286
circumstances	 4.120768201143934
about	 3.3194296428508996
various creditors of mr wickham in and near brighton with	 3.4032415265476876
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw	 3.2707994729683647
and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly	 3.441182210723763
of the silliest girls in the country i have suspected it some time but	 4.417059760073769

more unequal than she had often seen them	 3.4384438532940433

opportunity of dancing a reel	 3.319323224296153

cheering and heartening them up though as she never came without	 3.331115142125551
how should you have liked making sermons	 3.5399496985807057

expressed her fears of miss de bourghs being too hot or too cold or	 4.054235081284383
unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it	 4.4933779584742295
oh yes said elizabeth drilymr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr	 3.6305272040729677
more gentlemanlike manner	 3.087179619798871
imprudent as to fortune	 3.5731783768668732

that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me	 3.9006578355374453
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt their first subject was her	 3.6784919907897824
your situation with much compassion	 3.4450364095516894
aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she	 4.602204177803341
engaged with mr darcy that they scarcely ever saw him i found that	 3.6482316260123713
reuse it under the terms of the project gutenberg license included	 2.4095946341971914
however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor	 3.9208743210354036
man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and	 3.5914650597644853
temper her heart was not likely to be easily touchedthat i was	 3.9069731782481636
he suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they had	 4.074270141778174
richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself but the	 3.8271382085723555
having very frequent parties at home these parties were acceptable to	 3.996023209872713
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first	 3.8185785853517333
forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on	 3.973344281044763
when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply	 3.319111532057532
to get rid of him and unwilling for her sisters sake to provoke him	 4.150346982354158
unless he really comes to see her	 3.4528090059988963
thing for you in meryton oh here comes hill my dear hill have you	 3.9017556648740306
of the match cried elizabeth i should never have said mrs collins	 3.582983012409122
symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance	 3.2754218532578827
she supposed if he meant any thing he must mean an allusion to what	 3.7957833194571937
expectation of their marriage he spoke of it as a certain event	 4.106222585423105
as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and	 3.679899570701148
my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now	 3.397155704643167
again his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an	 3.8461214107685753

such a woman as mrs forster and the probability of her being yet more	 3.927755249987988
mrs bennet give up the point she talked to elizabeth again and again	 3.2649190575330707
produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sisters	 3.719266299248737
to convince him of his daughters being most comfortably settled and of	 3.3991620184742644

at pemberley before they left the country miss darcy though with a	 3.3375420530748627
i hope not so imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be	 4.446104533111687
to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on	 4.910690716654183
with him i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance	 3.6325278325121233

distance of her own family and friends	 4.538652679933224
enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word	 3.4976352197835148
all i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it	 3.3624592006392784

then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added	 3.410486508512085
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness	 3.138996939816953
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to	 3.2327356588380987

speak to lizzy about it yourself tell her that you insist upon her	 3.612563172821111
another reason too for her opposition she dreaded seeing wickham again	 4.352159008258586
i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and tell the	 3.9028913173283803

i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all	 3.538908040420156
roads were all to her taste and lady catherines behaviour was most	 3.4090369978782706
my object then replied darcy was to shew you by every civility	 4.3597219238329386
being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him	 3.240923660528314

mr collins was punctual to his time and was received with great	 3.9189519042376944
headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to	 3.422027210797458

his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as	 3.30372550573051
for a moment in silence she said very stiffly to elizabeth	 3.894435007064308
not do justice to his own disposition you have shewn him off now much	 3.682917886669138

as often as i can but you know married women have never much time for	 3.1883820448669034
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence it was absolutely	 3.707806976606378
always exceed your income	 3.470722680964665
calling her attention this observation would not have prevented her	 3.725867148610034

when they were all in the drawingroom the questions which elizabeth	 3.1929703350758403
prevented any public exposure but i wrote to mr wickham who left	 4.264193378760341
which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the roommany	 3.6395339158769944

nosaid darcy i have made no such pretension i have faults enough	 4.682917485143777

all worth pleasing so high and so conceited that there was no enduring	 3.7837297448252682
what a footing we are you see how continually we are engaged there in	 3.706515951891903
governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of	 3.8306819642781638
but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i	 3.277011657997252
afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly	 4.5085524792066245
ifbut however it may all come to nothing you know	 3.183469026788587
but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so ill of	 3.2151399946105608

thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me we must not	 3.277374764793328
at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such	 3.93821461386445
seriously assured her of its truth	 4.1324270068643365
through 1e<NUMBER> or obtain permission for the use of the work and the	 4.168433561708388

you may be sure of my pardon	 3.3954967246082335

frivolous as the application was illjudged you have widely mistaken my	 3.6534074081952643
carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a	 3.5962356394870594
one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him i could not	 4.688199793889483
i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy	 4.002731315171368
it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not	 3.487743092884591
no i should have turned in a moment	 3.883856059008506
see something of captain carter before he goes	 5.259913393952699
mrs gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could not	 3.214863019748986

oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her	 4.139540882799228
the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual	 2.99582423145985
down to quadrille and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino the	 4.722624593296849
her with his best respects to all her family not forgetting his thanks	 4.205447391785478
feelings followed them in silence she was overpowered by shame and	 4.278077269884356
in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to	 2.8648771313874795

what do you mean	 2.5700625495686937
took him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as we	 3.891378161820515
whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the	 5.085544586268504
had she found jane in any apparent danger mrs bennet would have been	 3.4321864715494024
was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the gate	 4.386315898766524
being in town i am certain from something she said herself and	 3.174253989146498

such a fuss i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put	 4.008315073730309
and do you impute it to either of those	 3.9106642844870567

brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at	 3.528292470622753
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to	 4.670476859574741
little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss	 3.6919629881130187
his house as her home when it suited her mr bingley had not been of	 4.315915787950733
thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared	 3.6977050560305553
but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her	 3.7647656646831322
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer	 3.7033581032294123
to depreciate such pleasures they would doubtless be congenial with	 4.559912057790117
and make him marry her if he comes away	 3.591112912712113
the time she had the same story to repeat every day mrs bennets best	 4.704805360474115
you shall hear what she says	 3.0630387301626887
disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of	 3.6353899755889754
where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go	 4.126966721671884
provoked her	 2.5979013951932544
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more	 3.257385842022874
it is not true a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood	 3.3111818419505585
died about five years ago and his attachment to mr wickham was to	 3.7049572709881726
and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room	 4.725268924433934
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on	 4.300882261498591
should ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia	 3.6426194196982773
which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as	 4.026913446714024
and returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall to	 3.6824809585838962
forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible	 3.9687592538885665
why is not every body as happy	 3.527342419455251
and trust he will excuse my not having done it before my total	 3.1969490219561143
and has since dined in company with him four times this is not quite	 3.0782340834994595
misrepresented	 1.919964484944678
spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer could there be	 3.276350739956941
learnt to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted her	 5.554051341084674
looks and behaviour the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia	 3.5607476726493545
at all	 2.905222612888382
moments deliberation	 3.98708886805703
something and then they soon found out what was the matter	 3.6924431542783718
you are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of your	 3.518535035923662
any thing be urged against my father who though with some	 3.247587214148922
my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in	 4.437626173211525
having him but let me advise you to think better of it i know your	 3.9636661959647768
true it will be wise in me to refrain from that but do not imagine	 5.318933449099914
and every body began to find out that they had always distrusted the	 4.070774971250667
of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look	 4.289729986954242
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was	 3.3506264639526053

was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation	 3.7278210198351447
comprehend	 4.14167096130449
a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she	 3.9862401046245988
as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not	 4.930905964654047

where we have not received written confirmation of compliance to	 4.346890983723432
no my dear i think not i have great hopes of finding him quite the	 3.5959616741630738
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude i was not in a humour to	 3.850015271246538

her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday which	 3.8219476250411324

you need not be frightened i never heard any harm of her and i dare	 5.113262123072583
a little more liveliness and that if he marry prudently his	 4.250308300532352

engagement mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment	 5.027792086305457
elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table	 3.487049404493154
returned within the stated time seriously however she felt tolerably	 3.5439065217995633
which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open	 3.749734286474037
such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen	 4.039718114073275
at least he has not deceived us haggerston has our directions and	 3.476023795558736
glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at	 3.800392539124934
immediately followed he spoke well but there were feelings besides	 3.204952739929874
you must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth	 3.4111819089592896
but my dear you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into	 3.2464415713995143
others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other	 3.582896157719127
day altogether she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had	 3.285168916198684
manner made him start and before he could recover himself enough to	 4.187131328914448
i do i do like him she replied with tears in her eyes i love him	 3.856468052763262
pardon for having displeased her in a softened tone she declared	 4.070500383499765
we have dined nine times at rosings besides drinking tea there	 4.4553881129411455
such boundless influence that he had been concerned in the measures	 3.573338918840182
mean by apologizing for being next in the entailwe cannot suppose he	 4.283206985552514
she ventured without any permission to do the same by all her	 3.556608111504911
with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many	 3.314493631372091
his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling that had	 4.324058197229188
she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of	 3.655064777111836
herselfthat could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost	 3.955263303415686

lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on	 5.09061617663408
little agreeable to her	 3.6661603539236647
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her respect	 3.137481956282447
selfdenial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love	 4.2379516772664125
felt a wish of enquiring his countenance voice and manner had	 3.808241720945425
wickham can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe	 3.379803665148725
tell me once for all are you engaged to him	 3.2063503546231824
i am astonished my dear said mrs bennet that you should be so	 3.4714067063555
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet the	 3.71573691634255
it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with	 3.7602928737585426
world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away	 3.150882805054235
indifference	 4.187897038727569
cousins their time passed till they entered meryton the attention of	 3.1904848741055676
gone my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have	 3.8569959725909566
information for them of a different sort much had been done and much	 3.4646713651513803
i can believe him capable if indeed it should be so but i dare not	 3.6667160375506245
remainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation to	 3.590553072284756
seem so wholly unexpected i am very very sorry so imprudent a	 4.4867735512091675
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the	 4.6632218112791115
in the church and his cousin could have none at all	 3.8026679664377494
her sister made not the smallest objection and the pianoforte was	 3.4812006697200397
speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such	 3.796014444346324
half a mile and then found themselves at the top of a considerable	 4.891352987817403
reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his	 4.5861955628257025
this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in	 4.341880050606995
which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your	 4.646809895520388
i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every	 4.280539738682244
he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling he	 3.965366148723459
despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with	 3.9010353016152597
she spoke an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened	 4.679093593226393
which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming	 3.8330772640642294
to protect the project gutenbergtm mission of promoting the free	 4.463368478077688
yourself	 4.160951057921132
thought he must be sensible himself it was a subject in short on	 3.8675166496459155
elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the	 3.483575671571307
and all the articles of plate which mr collins had promised and as he	 4.647815896935937
reason but your arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation	 5.109719733291428
a word about it till now	 3.580229512656251
i hope my dear said mr bennet to his wife as they were at	 4.194532439947476
to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy	 3.4897724881987164
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening	 3.9958920323402025
not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to	 3.9316454515957378
on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have	 3.812038243724823
feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me and so	 3.598560923989628
if he does not come to me then said she i shall give him up for	 3.910950875820261
might be won in the course of the evening but in an instant arose the	 4.278452214538097
report and i know i appeared distressed but dont imagine it was from	 3.543277024549436
how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter	 3.4474279294268477
oh papa what news what news have you heard from my uncle	 3.1584758230309107
want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel	 4.201453138191128
how hard it is in some cases to be believed	 4.635289186039584
yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly oh jane	 3.481911686226996
worth knowing after all	 4.151347836118966
girls had been on the point of marriage and after all there was nothing	 3.5928811757025287
it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr bennet and	 3.385532726271614
lady catherine seemed pleased	 2.8499830520053338
great comfort to them in their hours of freedom their other aunt also	 3.616608713408566
suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly to	 3.3680154414163215
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what	 4.566486850590581
my part mr bingley i always keep servants that can do their own	 3.097139370422568
the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from	 4.222924858759426
offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs collins and myself on	 4.589611972972891
less interesting mode of attachment be that as it may she saw him go	 3.4334483044353323

expeditiously married in london than in scotland	 3.5234446914830735
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr bennet the next	 3.5298961101024724
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and	 3.6066899373913013
having such a master	 3.687217211518054
were properly overjoyed on the occasion the younger girls formed hopes	 4.023867112511935
a peep at jane and in short as the time drew near she would have	 3.6420297832691144
i think you said she was a widow sir has she any family	 3.7078189411041516

situation and temper consider mr collinss respectability and	 3.2888143700995025
feel on his behalf is natural and amiable i cannot but wonder	 4.109579734015232
so far what could your ladyship propose by it	 3.462448371891384
to such perseverance in wilful selfdeception elizabeth would make no	 5.457707729033835
of replacement or refund described in paragraph 1f3 the project	 5.012786726507589
that is a failing indeedcried elizabeth implacable resentment	 4.222505295471054
by the servants account that their niece was taken suddenly illbut	 3.099053398361931
hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks	 3.205131423146232
world i love and he is an angel i should never be happy without	 4.471829943001718
in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her	 3.3945586599235837
and she would at times have given any thing to be privileged to tell	 4.158789036214102
no i thank you she replied endeavouring to recover herself there	 4.220221143565114

her father lifted up his eyes jane was distressed elizabeth looked	 3.4427450586550394
my dear mr bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome you	 2.9891798180107596
restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation for	 4.208237085527223
i must find mr gardiner this moment on business that cannot be	 3.053512831109847
much as possible here leading the way through every walk and cross	 3.214291724785368
then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike	 5.659721620200215
dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring	 4.602241725892706
i do not think we were speaking at all sir william could not have	 2.955016915961994
so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her	 3.810407021632653
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that	 3.6571718480560533
the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent	 3.2037346550162655
her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bingley and the	 4.238323742635755
information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting	 3.4015104682991475

the course of jane and elizabeths correspondence with her made her	 4.556246910173388
there can be no doubt of that it is settled between us already that	 3.8101896805892994
good health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after the	 3.223934523788618
gallantry from the idea it suggested of something moreit now first	 3.453960151466904

fancy the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers she	 4.892657821129649
she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no	 3.4072540140821315
had all been very illused since she last saw her sister two of her	 3.457040235148239
feels the loss of friends so much as i do but i am particularly	 4.490399810602466

lucass last week and even mr darcy acknowledged that the partridges	 3.100267578986657

temper i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride	 3.8885807542966653

flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me	 3.2737860239996537
elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more mrs	 4.792026176425934

were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain	 3.8410070952392465
from miss bennets general habits she was absolutely incredulous here	 4.127670994196903
upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the	 2.8518604812680315

her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend	 3.659663642709774
it is well you refuse then to oblige me you refuse to obey the	 4.197205584220498

they would not offer to send her home	 3.7173905605383086
elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection	 3.3072555377949038

will easily comprehend from these particulars that mr wickhams	 3.4374551152104753
his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride	 3.9748859471922966
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode and the	 4.842822940235526

the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her	 3.634370747767619
excellent manager i dare say if she is half as sharp as her mother	 3.994592351799452
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day nothing could	 3.9508948669106188
hoped that by carolines not living in the same house with her brother	 3.91532703801512

to spread at meryton	 3.8804436121605708
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr darcy	 4.2020181732075885

and jane seem so well to understand	 3.4165427218000115
according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that	 3.7348131463368963
forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she	 3.776265659306685
knowing what she did she accepted him he walked away again	 3.5837023039514033
for several years this has been my motive my fair cousin and i	 3.41258300058548
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected	 3.8746409595086537
approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed	 4.571610334258425
i rather wonder now at your knowing any	 3.398934080926181
going on in the country as in town	 3.2761464709316837
able to see your friends before they leave the country but may we not	 3.104437793830913
in undiminished beauty and more than once during dinner did mr bennet	 3.208624719599047
she will never play really well unless she practises more and though	 3.13027440839301
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second	 3.2657044415881558

sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had	 4.281870529510127

must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music	 3.4470834779598603
made by the latter it had not been very great he had lost every point	 3.8925797059054417
earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of	 3.5730506796902257
shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness lady	 4.193458456600557
for the liveliness of your mind i did	 3.7613763438802263
satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the	 3.271057260464024

accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of finding	 3.8221461878027516
would this event had at last been despaired of but it was then too	 4.071871488889737
above them all if i could but see you as happy if there were but	 3.8332613626532748
come mr wickham we are brother and sister you know do not let us	 3.29162582364674

on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most	 3.9494023003770877
as we went along kitty and me drew up all the blinds and pretended	 3.317295177491708
mrs gardiner then rallied her niece on wickhams desertion and	 3.3024933822056988
himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than	 4.818142571766665
but did not live to do itmr bingley intended it likewise and	 3.4264634625912085
interval of waiting appeared very long it was over at last however the	 3.289070034831174
of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express	 3.4610843984612005
elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet	 3.738458964836917
was spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr collins joining	 3.9423405072839013
admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust	 3.3499127151911074
received an invitation from mrs forster the wife of the colonel of the	 3.4050999277061034
unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a	 4.108193735343326
conviction as truly as i wished it in reasonmy objections to	 4.862892411903169
coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after	 3.453662727645175
you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him	 3.267754182613236
mr darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was	 3.5325416317352976
and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her	 3.882507674085043
that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection	 3.5992584826329796
remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of	 4.0069389733854
impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by	 3.062999890080934
all for janes sake you know and there is no occasion for talking to	 3.615320865915103
him more favourably spoken of by any one	 3.5241305581139963
mei believe it will be better that he should not i see the imprudence	 4.3401609411835524
doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea it is as	 4.13155755640698
there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to	 5.155483403804504
natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging there is	 6.321044865875057
or in other words you are determined to have him he is rich to be	 3.517759557985145

well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what	 3.3647498835849947
well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not	 4.145353918576682

with regard to lady catherines family is indeed the sort of	 3.300388004544033
society she was of course carefully kept and though mrs wickham	 3.8178234883530053
afraid you will be angry	 3.9293222975204976
for there was much to be discussed wickham of course wanted more	 4.056678957584234

informed that she was very accomplished	 5.083935440912587
blind to miss bingleys inattention after waiting at home every morning	 4.2072804026661315
has often said so and envied me janes beauty i do not like to boast	 4.030018364610517

partiality is not misleading me i think when i call charles most	 4.093967991271106

elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedlyand after an awkward pause	 3.3461838401693553
and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously	 3.56500839504721
ladies were ready enough to talk and mr collins seemed neither in need	 3.7800873612113643

bestowed it most unwillingly i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any	 4.135763936115568
speak she in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydias	 3.700017294413345
but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him	 3.4207417128745736
in another minute mr bingley but without seeming to have noticed what	 4.624224718228381
upon without some help any place would do of about three or four	 3.009328596868038
you do not blame me however for refusing him	 4.007971866622621
who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the	 3.851977672155005

satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because	 5.591549589540897
if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know	 3.552812124985373
soon as he comes	 3.8552508419200513
one serious parting look went away	 3.37269567621466
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help	 4.392617166124635
oh certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity we will	 3.4403996852420744

this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more	 3.7000793986670546

elizabeth half expected mr bingley to do he was able to bring darcy	 3.755779545470973

repeating it elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her	 3.64692787739596
it was two or three days before he could get from her what he	 3.570782032567194

together from gracechurchstreet for the town of in hertfordshire	 4.457213324671549
capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome	 3.4409399374591407
me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a	 4.238527133046546
application was a something to look forward to	 3.4670301931925662
this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another	 3.296313959262405

mr darcy replied with great intrepidity	 3.586283548698225

claims of duty honour and gratitude you are determined to ruin him in	 3.3822711104022396
between the two gentlemen but though jane would have defended either or	 3.8202653908281774
quality or other real or imaginary vanity and pride are different	 3.2152980087151075

elizabeth would not oppose such an injunctionand a moments	 4.382787749179779
with only one there is but such a quantity of merit between them just	 4.593052675129134
his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not	 3.2975535424461304
people had been seen to pass through with the kindest concern he	 3.9883166806591897

high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chuses to be seen	 5.291909415706258
representation of all this might make me quite easy but i know the	 3.244220103720828
elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit	 4.635092892493204
beyond a doubt they do wish him to chuse miss darcy replied jane	 3.0033233951979765
elizabeth the conversation was carried on miss darcy looked as if she	 3.889257771842577

curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the	 3.607943932835583
bennet coolly observed	 3.6135467898230047
weighty accusation of having injured mr wickham i can only	 4.124387007880065
from their aunt at present indeed they were well supplied both with	 3.2148979424086237
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in	 4.282043271651916

goodnatured wishes for her welldoing which had proceeded before from	 4.25814512681093
neighbourhood they shall never have admittance i will not encourage	 3.736293074080887
i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect he owns it	 4.257073589158327
opportunity	 4.3888257755894236

compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an	 4.787672348142547
all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry	 4.301279550454919
unpardonable in me	 3.5701859545140837
at mr darcy there is a fine old saying which every body here is of	 3.709087872805853
degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on	 3.9824457240337052

weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of i assure	 4.274549617782263
of an hours têteàtête with mrs bennet before breakfast a	 3.4258012582876467
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference	 3.3387165833142616
hope it why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the	 3.9308651576758833

their powers of conversation were considerable they could describe an	 3.3715492692187854

to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life	 3.625176713216778

that i may have it tomorrow	 3.5483154885301893
doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections you	 4.033410975147258
fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper	 3.5849709797597584

make after all their hertfordshire friends elizabeth construing all	 3.3683294718507897
would happen but who could have foreseen such an attention as this who	 4.102669732244856
was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send any	 3.6891516281894163
to rocks and mountains oh what hours of transport we shall spend and	 3.9346217476470504
and warmth remained for bingleys salutation he was full of joy and	 3.319117404811541
that mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival but	 5.024602974959333
who have been kept aloof by lydias folly	 3.5241515609351803

towards mr wickham i know not in what manner under what form of	 3.720863804252091
i wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is	 3.567711555755321
before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the	 4.269412267045011
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was	 3.2446706197171826
more then addressing her daughter oh my dear dear jane i am so	 4.043927303492123
may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him and to him too	 3.7097936451248166

regard they had frequently been staying with her in town	 4.046824603734614
could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other	 4.508569881336586
an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not	 4.209394424966564

not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise	 3.5168231637286995
not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their	 3.874947267289399
took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest	 3.9001149062708618
oh yesof that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt poor	 3.1734943550739034
income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in	 4.91485671287432
undoubtedly did you see him while you were at lambton i thought i	 3.9875893988163624
what he is about he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by	 4.378192656192128
professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable	 4.083354037708226

love	 3.9828815735024765
character and ideas between us we seem to have been designed for each	 3.670160374177946
elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention	 3.4956079918536274
she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy by the	 3.636745316076572
youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming	 3.664548181343751
habit of spending more than they ought and of associating with people	 3.8376064433910115
an hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there	 3.77641270159079
to be described wholly inattentive to her sisters feelings lydia flew	 4.438917190635026
violent hurry as mrs forster called her and they were going to the	 3.82581536482504
pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it she	 4.490057559015832
harmless from all liability costs and expenses including legal fees	 4.007271698853167
perhaps i am not doing her justice but she is very young she has never	 3.8912792390351596
when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that	 4.277351055167764
darcy had much better finish his letter	 3.799444533946853
other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be	 3.777155206055442
her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied	 4.819838882103605
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in	 3.2735771946024594

in the best light in the light in which it may be understood	 3.58643951156395
that mrs bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected	 3.8096201726885193
to continue the london road i know not what to think after making	 3.3667270861949916
the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious	 4.223291371554824

other table lady catherine was generally speakingstating the mistakes	 3.660187932845724
elizabeths mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired	 3.056296906615828
to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certain true he	 4.358596296593642

through her mothers hands lydias expences had been very little within	 3.9528646807868064
looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile in a few minutes	 4.081362203772065
palatable to you as it seems to be at present that you actually	 3.567290889947042
spirits and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had	 3.911162429147011
what do you think she said besides ah mrs bennet we shall have her	 3.3860314101312006

a constant state of change if you are outside the united states check	 3.609110071911788
pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to youif from no better	 3.716910790739554
twice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second	 4.099232695029704
alarm	 4.386301863988934
lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking	 4.564438616491428
her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and	 3.4674660479619264
elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall	 3.337792257988021
ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made	 3.856879518236515
my library in my night cap and powdering gown and give as much trouble	 4.244451247687927
you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this i see	 4.489100009702894
features though not plain were insignificant and she spoke very	 3.9167153469589184
but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that	 4.138658259472015
for she loves to be of use but tell me what did you come down to	 4.065562490480648
fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished since her	 3.7098660595034727
continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown	 3.1442534949666854
most forbearing courtesy	 2.9075419775594176
she replied in the affirmative	 3.736581082079953
looked almost wild	 3.8673691713941136
very much	 3.4792088222239173
them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle and though kitty	 4.528767784486329
blame you oh no	 3.5554488787919283
door he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to any one else	 3.521590665977721
it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant	 3.4703779629747635
he means to do i am sure i know not but his excessive distress	 4.303386825505605
i dislike it very much he replied but it must be done	 3.5671107547954217
to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of	 3.30475221167427
monday endurable to kitty and lydia	 3.601453029006826
certainly replied elizabeththere are such people but i hope i am	 3.7506223826769447
all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydia determined if	 3.752977289650745
going to the butchers she told me on purpose to order in some meat on	 5.127396173996388
more beautiful darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people	 5.1775427349643985
said	 3.6874481388388753
conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from	 3.539984898965473
and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending	 3.2360061755642002
alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed	 5.027867568923156
william collins	 3.925136878405586
not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage	 3.3143931600914955
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to	 3.622053060242751
considered it as the deathwarrant of all possibility of common sense	 3.9633702452294126
regret that he came	 3.5377866080122904
placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable she	 3.8082646315467956
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation	 3.9138841593130107
you write uncommonly fast	 3.6683339856627306
her being hereafter our sister i do not know whether i ever before	 3.6017187537109367
prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate	 3.959885323542977
dr gregory b newby	 2.3484090138086304
i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a	 3.2400787981729007
to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last	 4.779626960636168
thing best in the world and she was sure he would kill more birds on	 4.806015335889491
part of london my dear aunt how could you think of it mr darcy may	 3.8491852981398518
thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour and	 3.973925544268798
his life it is admirable	 3.5489999333163396
only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his	 3.5405870442562035
waking mr hurst	 3.232954819818614
lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her	 3.4190551610381683
she had purposely thrown herself in his way again oh why did she come	 3.483858309715464
their two selves only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion	 3.6783085513254195
elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded	 3.5505131759144875
mrs bennet who quarrelled with no compliments answered most readily	 3.556794515812547
and down they ran into the diningroom which fronted the lane in quest	 4.092060823630764
elizabeth made no answer she was afraid of talking longer of his	 3.06793221134016
latter depended on the will of the parents this was one point with	 5.328819616337751
ever	 2.986768755214081
effect	 3.6410297350275913
first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would	 4.520686419365843
permitted by us federal laws and your states laws	 4.505788604014149
1e9	 1.919964484944678
introduced the discussion of their affairs darcy was delighted with	 3.660801331307485
syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or any thing	 3.507679326249766
absolutely resolved on remaining where she was she cared for none	 4.212163514608909
were the principal inhabitants they found mr bennet still up with a	 3.376366739224964

to accompany sir william and his second daughter the improvement of	 3.4938448814328584
strong already but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i	 3.59755071488585
suddenly got up and saying to kitty	 3.579518998891345
behaviour than her sister	 3.8118577027822425
favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost	 4.086517411178255
window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse	 4.837437185446639
read it aloud said their father for i hardly know myself what it is	 3.409005489737066
it places mr darcy to be treating his fathers favourite in such a	 4.202869187509965
together and fourthly that the match might be broken off two	 4.2635733682447015
of them talk fast enough and wickham who happened to sit near	 3.229176163926925
yes very well i saw them the night before last	 3.3407429893108653
bingleys attentions to your sister had given rise to a general	 4.2522234986655025
miss bingleys eyes were instantly turned towards darcy and she had	 3.199688649679915
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his	 4.494978478116237
know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively	 3.6789588808650757
determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend	 3.7155043596219746
it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said	 4.196576118394785
down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and	 4.063830707048987
heart did whisper that he had done it for her but it was a hope	 4.84935458904305
necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it	 2.9756961517852303
bingley was uncivil to her and more teazing than usual to himself	 4.359956949192162
interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer	 3.3614698931197498
part of the house	 3.880193791965903
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of	 4.500371532427721
volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the	 4.282650291877045
way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it	 3.568437450603379
accomplishedshe plays and sings all day long in the next room is a	 3.706930609900569

elizabeth almost stared at hercan this be mr darcy thought she	 3.94950979762287
mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisters proficiency	 3.2983552882479055
bingley if she could but lizzy oh sister it is very hard to think	 3.256972799420798
quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a	 3.25231669747733
and all was soon right again	 3.37656275759992
hypocrisy of my soninlaw and pray lizzy what said lady catherine	 3.2207373285902134
introduce his friend mr wickham who had returned with him the day	 3.592330385485533
had gained their own room jane taking out the letter said	 3.222912284509686
there it is all very well i would go and see her if i could have the	 3.985264549530316
instead her liveliness had been never worse timed there was no help	 4.529815224155681
world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of any body i only	 3.761286914405421
converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me	 3.357638705553432
of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to	 3.3229276419655
of his designing friends and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to	 4.005857959812014
be not so let mr darcy contradict it besides there was truth in his	 4.157495245661012
upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is rather an	 2.7264351449679434
till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him	 3.509934697172576
when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to	 3.4192870485322744
you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy	 3.360630061671163
and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given	 4.396158578687496
at one end of the room	 3.784769845212132
person of ranksuch affability and condescension as he had himself	 5.177415747221214
any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such	 3.7398646058329557
indifferent would have prevented his coming down again	 3.5936306890452685
were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined	 3.8014742097149323
followed her into the diningparlour it was a large wellproportioned	 5.137942595383608
agitated manner and thus began	 3.2006642712030557
she did not choose it said her daughter she would go	 3.7887824674114943
five grown up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own	 3.2383410441232927
young gentleman the son of her late masters steward who had been	 3.400346107975751
mr bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that	 3.422295583237972
interest in him	 3.4802584830519687
also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness	 3.7531683579412793
elizabeths astonishment was beyond expression she stared coloured	 3.6093742190529907
not very differently engaged	 4.128297101053897
miss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks much unless	 3.6472968363876506
catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding	 3.0326049769096763
your arrival	 3.913184495192438
the communication excited many professions of concern and enough was	 3.3262075515388667
ever	 2.986768755214081
disapprobation	 1.919964484944678
desirous of believing her indifferent is certainbut i will	 3.2695430850050333
license terms from this work or any files containing a part of this	 4.393473539596359
why will you think so it must be his own doinghe is his own master	 4.1760233106235205
not think about officers any more than we do i remember the time when i	 3.3185988697616478
entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of	 3.1908100338226117
reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a	 3.2066545034473966
possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister	 4.166584932071652
mr collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which	 4.081225787080928
her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly	 3.876820605449447
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcy	 4.3617299180491695
a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and	 4.95894440529047
read and had all the masters that were necessary those who chose to be	 4.221891973595724
on that point what relates to yourself is as follows having thus	 3.6560317146390657
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth	 4.396145873841706
possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to	 4.135251483192243
i understood that there were some very strong objections against the	 3.058632282237352
him but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that	 3.735715086498078
at the request of mr bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him	 3.2093801781758104
i will not be interrupted hear me in silence my daughter and my	 3.4112209151975224
conversation beginning with his parsonagehouse and leading naturally	 5.107276887412209
she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till	 4.101429459949537
who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had she	 3.2986224122535024
in it	 3.398781492937072
the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of mrs	 3.5515056419332036
oh my dear mr bennet as she entered the room we have had a most	 3.4200478110976027
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed he was received by mrs	 3.7757765699897816
garden to mrs collins sat for some time without speaking to any body	 3.0672568356293524
he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being	 4.721445397702601
dear sir	 2.9696846385251936
my dear friend	 3.3517634961442546

go my dear cried her mother and shew her ladyship about the	 4.259677522943782
that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet	 3.457560484546454
at pemberley	 3.5012608721017227
mentioned in terms of such mortifying yet merited reproach her sense	 4.882969569713156
confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due	 3.925214913552976
my father and maria are to come to me in march added charlotte and	 3.643219351613551
and jane and for their sakes had patience with her mr darcy was	 5.305264088333599
was exactly what darcy had hoped to see they were able to love each	 3.370968975154574
as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side miss	 3.32484187283275
about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready	 4.853215326285306
walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word	 3.1225050212914396
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated	 3.4332032878935923
of his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine with less of	 3.5011344774030393
imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to	 3.835675924500713
you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings	 3.716381828852315
people here abouts know i am married today i was afraid they might	 3.778121699275727
clothes when i get to longbourn but i wish you would tell sally	 3.7759573735484153
had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on	 3.5625607242580495
the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged	 3.169585068295176
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer	 3.85166871357866
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth	 3.619014561518334
what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters let me take it	 3.2518744545785494
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns	 4.522400557551464
deeply affected not lydia only but all were concerned in it and after	 3.280539527047834
she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to	 3.910267732347612
remember eliza that he does not know janes disposition as you do	 3.713307985594089
refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discompose	 3.5367729982922755
yesif darcy does not put it off again but i am at his disposal he	 3.761032489366408
something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty as	 4.439800468148846

them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the	 4.872475363392853
own words so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to	 4.4281972283635875
it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married	 3.516732112824354
family owe me nothing much as i respect them i believe i thought	 3.6865432761914776
pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs	 3.8428147068073657
while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we	 4.209898723216817

you will never get a husband at alland i am sure i do not know who is	 3.4317818169619447
eveningelizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment	 3.7063422581474303
astonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of mrs	 3.475267878707129

his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bennet his marriage was	 3.561485195357316

i do not know when i have been more shocked said she wickham so	 3.6939415450134105
honours us during your stay here her behaviour to my dear charlotte is	 3.3423986559065355
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the	 4.659952575916598

as no objection was made to the young peoples engagement with their	 3.6781319856576165

at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually	 3.466287773099234

i know them a little their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike	 3.3197935498689355
say in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself	 4.345201628231675
there is no danger of wickhams marrying mary king theres for you she	 3.8822192210524706
constrained manner said	 3.4126177052060336
yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word	 3.740553066283937
that the chimneypiece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all	 4.962289582245702
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr gardiner after	 3.544544359074484
but will they make you happy	 3.359844930240599
this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how	 3.776837591461844
you begin to comprehend me do you cried he turning towards her	 2.9502395226717937
will be but half deserved	 3.181950397341503
my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission	 3.750718495208388

decorums which other people may observe if she does not object to it	 3.519718817922571
i have already told her so once by your desire	 3.2155710971623392
be written to all their friends in lambton with false excuses for their	 3.9760297938511346
and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to	 4.186387868212497
this is not to be expected and as to my father i never in my life	 3.713548133885322
love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment and from	 4.13525878397964
he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to any	 3.207652240735149
had never seen a place for which nature had done more or where natural	 3.196203914572781
i hope added mrs gardiner that no consideration with regard to	 3.249517361760986
returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given	 3.230310646847389
year letters of business too how odious i should think them	 4.201843352212387

to understand it could not be for society as he frequently sat there	 3.600737283501341
likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken	 4.379831778318248
pleasanter aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent	 3.4760637983827576
congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever	 3.719388145310324
sister and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply to	 3.9441143537267283
her sister her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore to	 3.7002838578696053
insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of	 3.150652446833618
wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he	 4.4038892344056455
she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale with	 5.058370119984139
darcy did not wish for cards and mr hurst soon found even his open	 3.8934822567966094

had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her	 3.5298118295215475
nothing on the contrary could be more natural and while able to	 4.171685362482601
wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked when those dances	 3.5323999637180985
of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man	 3.525926523089848
found a rapid vent in the first place she persisted in disbelieving	 4.512695409021506
one most reluctant smile never had his wit been directed in a manner so	 3.804521935970727
she had herself endured on a similar occasion five and twenty years	 3.4764124743013034
her no more but though the probability of the statement was admitted at	 4.781905577944504
wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern	 3.912483253810182
for being so silly	 3.5030334370766085
together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman	 3.4424314842723214

she longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really	 4.788654713591064
home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers there was	 4.591666816536183
such a one as will allow of frequent journeysand i am persuaded my	 3.665105877465829
authoritative a tone as marked her selfimportance and brought mr	 3.8135369622176696
darcy only entered the room	 3.1633079946241764
his hand as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of	 3.916423210430568
and your defect is a propensity to hate every body	 5.434780575498603
oh thoughtless thoughtless lydia cried elizabeth when she had	 2.8713500602447852

you are joking lizzy this cannot beengaged to mr darcy no no	 3.9523314545533474
from netherfield and was opened immediately the envelope contained a	 4.283479117060326
but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so	 4.549826816638916
engrossed by mr darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for mr	 3.635669504501524
frame so that he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like	 4.842626049168643
elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to	 3.4614474489070766
her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of	 4.515453459847678
novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such	 3.6101481851118105

i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us it was more	 3.1532994264750918
indignation after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she	 3.5198466671699853
where is your sister said he hastily as he opened the door	 3.744241207638148
longer the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will	 3.97898497815401
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by	 5.275286498157723
allowances and urged the possibility of mistakesbut by everybody else	 4.097925728230239

ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at	 3.6265665482020863

i dare say you will find him very agreeable	 3.4890010585465547
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner but do you think she	 3.779957387265314
him he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very	 3.431684655133061

no nothing at all	 3.50363455246763
probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak	 4.536283665477754
if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley it	 4.319646271024319
known i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain	 4.749762996033208
reserve can be answerable for the event but in spite of all this	 4.412386681320695
it is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patience	 3.5525346122604473
soon went away but before she had been three minutes in her own room	 3.721440600184325

fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her	 3.401730851528142
interest for him to be guilty of it i cannot think so very ill of	 4.695921797215233
reasonable her expressions more moderate it would have spared her from	 4.113486406186302

family jane heard them with horror a gamester she cried this is	 4.080594916970673
a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but	 4.1637266911941495
may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married	 3.266915305760384

his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as shewed an	 3.673271393990496

either now seriously what have you ever known of selfdenial and	 3.403414193806183
and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the	 3.4400230366670432
believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this	 3.906553425209846
was her only alternative she declared her resolution	 3.7042461058991245
as mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she	 3.6223259857547556
to this mary very gravely replied far be it from me my dear sister	 3.066169727280034
her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined	 3.5024698429532917
before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if mr bingley	 4.8416836641724315
received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel	 3.6549096198148407
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partneryou	 3.3561393899176672

happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs bennet got	 3.4290094405518214
they each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with mr	 3.184818798618618

another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with him	 3.895596657282889
to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to	 3.990344543715642

is to spend an evening in this way i declare after all there is no	 3.7192523951867598
you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civility	 3.09054157360995
saw any thing of it to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle	 3.8513833906053803
half as delightful as pemberley	 3.426859246347334
wickham she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and	 3.3708122368089435
forget it ourselves they were off saturday night about twelve as	 3.802344567084125
guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to	 3.654193505001141
for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower all was joy and	 3.1692984067999093
from you very soon miss bingley said something of his never	 3.703943338887377
and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the	 3.8621827433369753
and the kind of halfexpectation which mrs gardiner had formed of	 3.869548051662679
altered a creature that when she went away i was perfectly	 3.457977414917676
will believe me the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent	 3.902631943320073
you did and it was not wholly without foundation you may remember	 3.7495474101219566
after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two	 4.361757130640301
her ladyships desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnish	 3.23377310034238

wedding need not be put off for mr darcy might have done as well	 3.727254058889986
high she immediately said	 3.485827639948011
his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and	 4.050789567205645

confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me	 4.050313700521326
one into it i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have	 4.375924068034846
you mean to frighten me mr darcy by coming in all this state to hear	 4.0303100960380505
something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of	 3.4634841368378626
looking at the picture it is a handsome face but lizzy you can tell	 3.728969674225802

the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived	 4.606875252919979
often applied to feelings which arise from an halfhours acquaintance	 3.5201127482732493

him before mr whats his name that tall proud man	 3.4983782517175763
seemed danger of lydias engrossing him entirely for she was a most	 3.8855186084210334

see 42671hhtm or 42671hzip	 3.7983196735149987
very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings and	 3.387038109044107
motive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonestfor	 4.1087472922553765

she is a great fool for going away if she liked him	 3.1391118342667648
with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held	 3.7719118728939076
it did bingley is most unaffectedly modest his diffidence had	 5.274617246113604
twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too on this	 4.502068240406719
this roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being	 3.133972431190958
more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the	 3.1640325020221076
him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by i only fear that	 4.4498493164283355
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper written	 4.73630943871535
husbands incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her	 4.938562892276983
chaperon you about to all the balls dear me we had such a good piece	 3.694129086975011
insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of	 3.486084419539721

before the carriage stopped at longbourn house	 3.9541827442132185
from any return of mr collinss addresses by engaging them towards	 4.14434884578515
calling yesterday to thank me she finds miss pope a treasure lady	 4.262746476541143

with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to	 3.968354827066711
to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was	 4.2051169343307935
girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is	 3.482121263984577
here again i shall give you painto what degree you only can tell	 3.4445470858159375
it the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you we know	 3.4369759182092485
the kingdom he promises fairly and i hope among different people	 5.245452789777205

as janes	 4.020703648979786
not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did	 3.4609359283800045
elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew	 3.4029266363562045
other	 3.7138721585665664
satisfaction she had promised herself it was consequently necessary to	 3.6745805874943733
death made her mistress of this fortune	 5.006314042762516
very young woman and very lately married a resemblance in good humour	 3.9390794722604485
mr collinss return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of	 3.4420914975203
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and	 3.591158677707033
prevailed on to get out	 3.641860377777283
not have been more wretchedly blind but vanity not love has been my	 4.206149663066318
on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than	 3.621961068562924
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every	 4.7085506359877245
will favour me with your company	 3.5507760800228243
having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in	 3.337271113858446
each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so	 3.8328175442570798
but really considering his descent one could not expect much better	 3.501041651088752
of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far	 4.015655025701389
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the	 3.242174998083279
brought to reason i will speak to her about it myself directly she is	 3.374146220651611
could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her	 4.1583408999686355
attending to what passed between darcy and his companion the perpetual	 3.279093804183819
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and	 3.1605249390897554
better looking it is what every body says i do not trust my own	 3.9353135153563437
governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have	 3.379648486045647
myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce	 3.487626683810559
yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of	 3.8092111791128147
her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to	 4.015683117765879
appearance of acquaintance was dropt how he lived i know not but	 3.348529598670027
what jane felt for bingley her astonishment at his comingat his	 3.8559133655997613
spelling and hyphen changes have been made so that there is consistency	 3.854439652641532
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire	 3.6310851193717704
could not bear such suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paper	 4.309153117455465
feelings of others were such as to form that groundwork of	 3.5238915810300018
all compassion in anger she tried however to compose herself to	 3.368928529213218
nothing	 3.586501958299716
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and	 4.5785690747657295
evening party and he bore with the illjudged officiousness of the	 4.209534284699007
indeed mr collins all praise of me will be unnecessary you must	 3.71138377902381
in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex	 4.482784563222289
soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last i	 3.090892149367654
younger boys were to be left under the particular care of their cousin	 3.5917527359135257
perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh said	 4.136620812452156
no but it must be done soon	 3.9040802402200483
and she refused him the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have	 4.0832721674150685
but they are not i hope of understanding my temper i dare not vouch	 3.335489310752624
them into harmony and plenty	 3.8173537702521805
frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of	 4.0942644290832835
oh lord i dont know not these two or three years perhaps	 3.2757850352067233
reasonable to be sure you knew no actual good of mebut nobody thinks	 3.572956614269276
kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe	 4.357472750713739
messages to his sister mr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet and	 3.671001227089104
party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other i hope we	 4.134928914037838
sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how	 3.8688584867488203
to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming	 5.105623243033483
even wish for any renewal of his attentions his character sunk on every	 4.367577930920972
replies they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the	 3.903247873270718
agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be	 4.0880587541572435
it will pass away soon enough	 3.207778500341047
project gutenbergtm works	 3.0610846205253557
meryton thought she might as well call on you i suppose she had	 3.5693443410061882
knowledge of your ill opinion too and having to relate such a thing of	 3.72107970131827
object when i am in company with him i will not be wishing in short	 3.7688289955868637
know it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him	 5.414389678977022
if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the	 3.250853059252607
pleasanter is not it mr bingley	 3.105400434406792
wickhams affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to	 3.5433820695590033
is also defective you may demand a refund in writing without further	 4.146392408098498
gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the	 4.888968239320913
concern to the little town of lambton the scene of mrs gardiners	 3.9491335481743484
her niece however did her justice and pitied her	 3.3995899834584207
nothing and i will not be sent on a fools errand again	 4.765533901345749
you i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine i believe nobody	 3.050430959549943
the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not	 3.3367143919666065
i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate if it was	 3.7564816484147836
you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the	 3.4886894017797183
had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended	 3.910570106782507
correspond with the sister she will not be able to help calling	 3.9120390954129256
on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by	 4.321714902275542
an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to	 3.7206045285056857
strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so	 4.293604460523537
very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour	 3.713273180220569
she only said in reply with a goodhumoured smile	 3.9703149478138973
almost every day they called at various times of the morning sometimes	 3.323512725122238
unaffected though not quite so chatty jane was anxious that no	 3.3351615135556467
he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time	 3.7334046209978977
mrs hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed	 4.486366638760824
and immediately said	 3.6592252334827733
when after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment	 3.5640892730420304
since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love	 4.457078475617129
the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only	 4.456981985841718
him it is because he will not give himself the trouble	 3.339200503528924
lydias purchases were seated in it	 3.383054822408762
not hesitate	 2.9831427938960062
that will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at	 3.8023917692282163
as they walked home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass	 3.5468303902892284
to the fortune of their proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration	 3.9069365911280967
your sister is crossed in love i find i congratulate her next to	 3.7732038057258444
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement there are a few	 4.404534701404124
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not now be sincere	 3.2650308407355624
surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party	 4.204763034889037
after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last	 4.044236703499858
all that embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the	 4.081847882980305
thought the same and added	 3.858836680127514
a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant	 3.2641317773435468
yoube assured that we are all well what i have to say relates to	 3.719211953856244
the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her	 3.4834948353775728
before his debts to be discharged and something still to remain oh	 4.580887149196754
while	 3.6988306406285743
replied that he was adding but we expect him tomorrow with a	 4.4689099003760155
not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic	 3.1167877107499526
what is mr darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him i am	 3.875113731306445
he then told her of georgianas delight in her acquaintance and of her	 3.498637379347145
my aunt she continued is going tomorrow into that part of the	 3.177759853455168
bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to	 3.76312870006323
i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister it	 3.9585868883240036
lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievablethat one false	 4.592183463216699
with an officer on the other side of the way the officer was the very	 5.035898138729397
other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be	 2.9629949092050034
because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a	 4.550719192873215
youngest daughters and her mother with manners so far from right	 3.6767783610616154
how good it was in you my dear mr bennet but i knew i should	 4.01820331014208
that i have never been much in love for had i really experienced that	 4.011797855227831
constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great	 3.7718051044375716
me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying	 3.6860468715811994
sisters absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of	 4.019676764789648
remember that four evenings have been also spent togetherand four	 3.524391337885518
chief of it was overheard by mr darcy who sat opposite to them her	 4.545862891818593
chapter viii	 1.9160620946979579
and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when she rose	 3.9822112458636516
these three weeks	 3.662725751473115
be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling	 3.14572780639831
have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the	 3.4922995451753738
woman and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces between the	 3.2755909539382833
receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself instead of a	 3.791020181899916
meet mr darcyshe felt all the perverseness of the mischance that	 3.832195652563806
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingleys dislike of her had	 3.571723005115603
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal mr darcys	 3.6831457450137015
behaviour there was a constant source of vexation and regret and in	 4.53166609359198
the housekeeper came forward and told them it was the picture of a	 3.2081463319183743
youand so i warn youi have done with you from this very dayi	 3.6392403192597595
mary for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great	 5.023275087976958
performing copying or distributing any project gutenbergtm works	 3.307562429478701
and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump but	 4.594504052322791
sheet of elegant little hot pressed paper well covered with a ladys	 4.656088896865134
would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy and with regard to the	 4.086349556324665
whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his	 3.6377160541758577
them as instruction but i will no longer importune my young cousin	 3.846032564179799
by any of us	 3.7439765304831067
if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as	 3.753785106954208
every hour in his esteem	 3.6205421820041823
and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making	 4.745606568095532
known sir williams too long he could tell her nothing new of the	 3.360514751896089
wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man	 3.8959319636050593
and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent it was for the	 4.924341619977093
satisfy mr collins and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyships	 4.346821577974217
elizabeth read on i have seen them both they are not married	 3.26938083735371
pressing entreaties that they would come in and even in spite of mrs	 3.9150335187530914
faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of	 3.902549261781254
family the far and the near must be relative and depend on many	 3.6116658571228397
what to think	 3.555431647327952
leave to say very impolitic toofor it is provoking me to retaliate	 5.250351884569948
outstrip them they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy	 3.391410127508117
but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure they are	 4.380513468361085
you are mistaken i write rather slowly	 2.757882339680536
she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to	 4.286687503768462
as the ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn elizabeth	 4.251978800023581
she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could	 4.2776672536244735
my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who	 3.3465209911845033
come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult	 5.47213841141479

over that gravel walk i do not know a place in the country that is	 4.063961957555078
chapter iv	 1.9160620946979579
but it will have no effect on me	 3.4460255698660753
that you were gone into the army and she was afraid hadnot turned	 4.640826310563727
time first of all he asked miss lucas i was so vexed to see him stand	 4.241460426641362
engaged to my daughter now what have you to say	 3.364894482215309
mrs gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all	 4.103322569161613
to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is	 3.160092675725879
ayethat is because you have the right disposition but that	 3.3723336116059284

you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less	 4.707286961914249
they could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were	 3.758594832713031
other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial	 3.3392208959224248
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse	 3.286693883550898
acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen	 3.504329519437824
the defence of some little peculiar vexation	 3.357149496315962
and lydia but while they were supported by their mothers indulgence	 3.4705481726926037

and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings this mrs	 3.7311892393386885

economy and other amiable qualifications	 3.2306248827330997
niece should be married from this house of which i hope you will	 3.6472658645989
you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on	 6.028596882480896
without anger such treatment but sir williams good breeding carried	 3.591112952685019
became by proper attention and management less irritable less	 3.8510550525815153
mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley he	 4.34673250545333
to the scheme	 3.4631818590787575
the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no	 3.7053736219654474
was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached	 5.053711829581654
like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to	 3.7352921288941463
civility i am thus rejected but it is of small importance	 3.9536018160449564

poor lydia an express came at twelve last night just as we were	 3.3543418935154494

happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character	 3.36756124528641
of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i	 3.157318842302704

oh yes be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy say that	 3.9502713106961362

balls and i will take care to get good partners for them all	 3.773355412338962
purport of his letter was to inform them that mr wickham had resolved	 3.994961964405386

the confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with him into the	 3.6008694197999462

and her ideas were nearly worn out before the têteàtête was over on	 4.322423834440008
of what are you telling miss bennet let me hear what it is	 3.5257418603755935

in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now	 5.472295072376066
lawn it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the	 3.475331671938517
elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude	 3.702983734511711
saw mr darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her	 5.025524025475513

depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them	 3.8169547202976495
mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a	 4.535973152430324
mistakenor at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of	 2.911763874819727
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting	 3.0410600288072867
time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings and it was now heightened	 5.464589446501952
when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i	 3.3531846128312646
occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to	 4.341125289876982
leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable	 3.9719873352029427

occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself	 3.936673493731031
roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself	 3.595424421072332
your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline	 3.6190293926411554
if as i conclude will be the case you send me full powers to act	 4.254882382920261
the most agreeable man i ever sawand if he becomes really attached to	 3.6455160660539425
library to myself as soon as may be	 4.252717457372559
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress of	 3.2622634094711396
circumstances she thus went oni am now convinced my dear aunt	 3.5211534789782073
acquaintance but that is all i have nothing either to hope or fear	 3.6934037777911315
their visit as they returned except what had particularly interested	 2.9572875744943183
from b intending to trace their route he did trace them easily to	 4.878000134165476
i desire you will do no such thing lizzy is not a bit better than the	 3.8656032395951834
then flow in i appeal to mr darcybut let me not interrupt you	 4.558905173147309
elizabeth to hunsford she had not at first thought very seriously of	 3.7044265955882625
otherwise if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or	 4.401522680103492
hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls though	 4.428419928091656
the strength of his attachment	 3.5843788485413857
use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and	 4.023335347562174
which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit when mr collins could be	 3.2229019791205906

unwilling to comply with their brothers proposal and it was settled	 3.7172371800653727
own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to	 3.932444228181107
them from her husbands room crossing the road and immediately running	 3.3974005111193195
are you indeed and pray what sort of guardians do you make does your	 3.5640388225868556
could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other	 4.018670961179118
such premeditation and her intreaty that she would not give into it	 4.3503319622640095
pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those	 4.8850565945897815
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those	 4.452939491544617
sister as the servant was approaching the door jane looked a little	 4.00871658815299
in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by	 6.128593807353011
again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but	 3.5413355503899426
tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards the prospect of such	 4.623845179329321
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was	 4.266471528659128
miraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of money and rank she	 4.085475168712951
acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an	 4.636664929919017
was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversationa	 3.400149645759899
at last to gosaying as she quitted the room if any young men come	 4.2944093920089115
is hepoor elizato be only just tolerable	 3.40095752335028
generations	 1.919964484944678
elizabeth answered only by a slight bow her thoughts were instantly	 3.53749266078597
commendations of the lady either on his handwriting or on the evenness	 3.6608812835693416
the letter she found little except the professed affection of the	 3.39382156335223
scruple to call out	 3.5548763477769545
else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after	 4.792132044203955
recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which	 3.3536326130247294
you must acknowledge to be true	 3.81048212788944
but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them	 4.291465361930357
family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your	 3.617919477549248
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1e8	 3.407224863881123
elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the	 3.115911772643948
be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself	 4.31561193864075
that will make your ladyships situation at present more pitiable	 2.840847617316471
as comfortable as possible and i do not think it of light importance	 3.828534168331665
i am glad you are come back lizzy	 2.8034456884447883
her twice only think of that my dear he actually danced with her	 3.4595166572667377
him and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window	 3.2782764748643207
amongst the most violent against him was mrs bennet whose dislike of	 3.7437550827953427
with his friend	 3.1440011800280288
possible to find out led the way across the street under pretence of	 4.135229401000156
lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added	 3.1314943923172933
you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means	 3.9573815350269794
gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the	 3.8734837758833214
present occasion and secondly of my room i shall be glad to have the	 4.504786868660127
whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious in the desperation	 4.1509176244135375

very intelligible gallantry	 2.9878305025474012
mrs gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now	 3.5577501517421664
pretty sittingroom lately fitted up with greater elegance and	 3.9033488895398376
progress was slow for mr gardiner though seldom able to indulge the	 3.9293946127464916
oh my dear brother replied mrs bennet that is exactly what i	 2.8841102008250843
pleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers and though this	 3.6124365808354724

my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley	 2.932159366270774
i never heard that it was	 3.5244715998771077
for one half hour	 3.375946067334143
forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow	 3.296702683178222
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city	 3.1191065153863216
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly	 4.040330595105963
never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as	 4.143214242572218
if not by himself such a hope was cherished the letter was to this	 4.090311649985457
this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of	 3.197086452892592
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so	 3.636668296296759
that kind may befal you you have an affectionate mother who will always	 3.832078319024969

were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect	 4.205397941413937
bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued	 4.4787279121075905
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to	 3.537856065478941
instituted by the church of england as a clergyman moreover i	 4.0348060276296875
soon be the wife of mr darcy console lady catherine as well as	 4.4988847667241
impatiently met her at the door of the dressingroom to ask why lady	 4.570847806995779
brought the following note for elizabeth	 3.79919645415801
attended her noble guest down stairs as they passed through the hall	 4.002375831266503
in the diningroom they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been	 3.5048262484927664
but you do not know all i will read you the passage which	 4.051510665556365
materially affected by the difference her sisters situation remained	 4.005352688254263
disappointments abroad	 2.0712554686369473
neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth have any	 3.1952633809000677
you observed it mr darcy i am sure said miss bingley and i am	 3.959116283622844
for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets	 4.072001779380786
supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which	 4.347866019348868
who do you mean my dear i know of nobody that is coming i am sure	 3.477981686902886
exceedingly as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its	 4.092094988928777
you need not distress yourself the moral will be perfectly fair lady	 3.5469355015749535
the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice	 5.6247602136635075
happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never	 3.7847839583359795
license you must require such a user to return or	 5.273083774918942
bingley if he had been imposed on would have much to suffer when the	 3.743690317489192
much	 3.8270765236643216
hayepark might do said she if the gouldings would quit it or the	 3.644286728421291
particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him	 3.7355168017568894
that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion when mr	 3.4414307169060936
her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas	 3.650163794651952
valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some	 4.259842760121991

the ball but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill	 3.2647929043925754
spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by supposing that	 3.6481104023138147
morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement one	 4.452660529976364
ceremonious card jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the	 3.72283484385892
one of her gowns and you cannot imagine how well he looked when denny	 4.333491129299933
this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter said	 3.0396838242174073
nothing child nothing i did not wink at you she then sat still five	 3.8420008689014873
separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their	 4.0162755093805345
delight in vexing me you have no compassion on my poor nerves	 3.7006799830306174
de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have	 3.4668303849925484
the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would	 2.909415029540775
very very much nothing could give either bingley or myself more	 3.2389672595758245
feared w was not a man to be trusted my poor mother is really ill	 4.724993613182201
it must be my uncles doings generous good man i am afraid he has	 3.4822501540325828
urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly to receive her	 4.120387594875819
reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only	 3.8879039002022404
kept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went	 3.491232553877601
yes in conjunction with his friend	 4.323946826051669
every body was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment	 3.5575014143682737
violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it	 3.538633873746855
they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put	 3.4479922912648893

married you know at st clements because wickhams lodgings were in	 4.333857848180031
i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women	 3.1248355421800658
oh yes you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i	 3.392400806905551
you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound you know it is not	 4.387980477615987
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well as to what	 3.849539540125042
again till he had something of importance to mention	 3.2533791511980477
except thought elizabeth when she goes to ramsgate	 4.1324106798511115
you doubt me cried jane slightly colouring indeed you have no	 4.094999849947553

elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such	 4.083035005066444
lady	 4.420808635578102
with regret and in this early example of what lydias infamy must	 4.005531345034342
in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying	 3.439328015705022
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content but her own opinion	 4.116544569375774
running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back	 3.304039617401396
of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger	 4.775324880273569
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mothers	 3.8237305083110082
laid the foundation it is too long ago i was in the middle before i	 4.4257478487458455

if i had been able said she to carry my point of going to brighton	 4.0438863629586415

manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we	 3.8495076645829287
visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he	 3.9277700839355383
wholly unexpected i had not an idea of it	 4.347040676752
is he married or single	 3.4097000871659366
confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running up	 3.930187306456975
could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easiness	 3.0951740597310042
difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded	 3.737996877267393
how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its	 3.1244622913949534
wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities were worn	 4.445415910585727
of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of	 3.513868303214901
conversation till they reached the house in the hall they parted	 4.018486047494119
am excessively attentive to all those things you must send john with	 4.215336466227783
interference lest mary should be singing all night he took the hint	 3.7354242562163105
his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have	 3.5591098573381954
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and	 3.0470306904559443
more than we had and the consciousness of this was another	 4.421303934671535
elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with	 2.970075470296838
its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means	 4.141519065036877
and advised them to do it differently found fault with the arrangement	 3.785543177707187
take whatever you like and get away	 3.261487758980885
him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of	 3.995447397403786
unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the	 3.614562802867135
would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men he took leave	 3.9417926813919046
nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself as to	 3.5107201660518186
i have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to his being	 3.4407475700778787
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as	 3.202899699968201
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her the expression	 3.5008350278565175
made up the match gave the money paid the fellows debts and got him	 4.517479220316349
darcy was fixed in astonishment when i consider she added in a yet	 3.1548684580981474
she soon afterwards said	 3.126010403606121
gretna green something was dropped by denny expressing his belief	 3.9170814741544704
must confess not that i mean to find fault with you for such things	 4.054509527961936
case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it	 3.693350690655157
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examine	 3.4892258823868145
objections i have already urged i have still another to add i am no	 3.712155065988453
under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof	 3.935115849792699
calmelizabeths courage did not fail her she had heard nothing of	 4.505028275921405

that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the	 3.4450874916728784
body	 4.066642451237499
perfectly satisfied but what does he say of the living	 3.0162482814187075
wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of	 3.5295245155349773
netherfield long enough she attracted him more than he likedand miss	 3.976881971190636
especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing	 3.4206261077224385
from their own feelings and his servants report without any reference	 3.306524070958133
let me write for you said jane if you dislike the trouble	 3.2487572675706766
indeed you are mistaken i have no such injuries to resent it is not	 4.263762263697379
both	 3.8735487458029665
frequent discussion between her parents elizabeth saw directly that her	 3.771786817520634
oh where where is my uncle cried elizabeth darting from her seat	 3.876355300836296
but i was embarrassed	 3.5557235922691808
brother gardiners in town so much in love with her that my	 3.5713031808408577
now i have got some news for you said lydia as they sat down to	 2.881194448373412
people in all walks of life	 4.069389116826483
it is more than i engage for i assure you	 4.155844011091991
bingley was the person meant it was all conjecture	 3.4494584997767133
shut i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness	 3.8046482409309537
short duration the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the	 3.3515943300286195

twelvemonth happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance if	 3.0924953933991106
you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir	 3.33836291823842
feelings though fervent were little displayed and that there was a	 4.123278212148721
doubt of your secrecy my sister who is more than ten years my	 3.785149489487224
is that his design in settling here	 3.560041405871301
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away	 4.2635104589782
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related they were natural and just	 3.153046916769312
him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him	 3.114819166510325
mr darcy who was leaning against the mantlepiece with his eyes fixed	 4.549324982136903
give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much	 4.342888999019725
up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living	 4.033710274588902
been in the way of procuring	 3.4961194474761816
but upon my honour i do not i do assure you that my intimacy has not	 3.9774878969370584
the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined	 3.3050510875890677
acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly	 3.7943096240041108
its being a degradationof the family obstacles which judgment had	 4.008866430872059
observances which he supposed a regular part of the business on finding	 3.8523536076893
towards them with a look of curiosity and that her ladyship after a	 3.8878631922690383
elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to	 3.894229557360113
all lost upon me i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably	 3.449545279920614
he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading	 3.404429054235765
kind listener in mrs philips and was by her watchfulness most	 3.876579110745415
handsome thought upon the whole i am much pleased with him	 3.5061010800861934
acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect	 4.0736142626199054
yes very different but i think mr darcy improves on acquaintance	 3.861273290835073
la my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake it is not lady	 4.586108469085303
the praise where it was due but lizzy this must go no farther	 4.153945677474263
a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stoodthe sort of	 4.21702286827849
breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise she was proceeding	 4.535636131459938
out	 3.7776423617554435
i am far from attributing any part of mr bingleys conduct to design	 3.5172012506550416
and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of	 4.062653614042985
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she	 5.045538024534119
unable to utter a syllable nor was it under many many minutes that	 3.9712350459783985
entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was	 4.609399851205383
party in a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing at the	 4.882165749440482
elizabeth said to her	 3.4820789846073112
all be as we were before	 3.8037478326926433
said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long	 4.726576460806979
of their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it was	 3.91182671649664
communication would therefore do for all after a slight preparation	 3.3057414609646485
ever he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to	 3.5783410825341324
will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances	 3.1893507572300703
say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud	 3.1665315298195926
consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match i thought it my duty	 4.651894532989362
returning to netherfield again	 2.9304765189714335
distance was a beautiful object every disposition of the ground was	 3.3318575342380887
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease	 4.354757841757495
your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was	 4.572617652971022
civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and	 5.503370673493969
mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast the fishing scheme had been	 3.170085665130826
lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied	 4.081293784478568
with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her	 3.370129216627329
pray do not talk of that odious man i do think it is the hardest thing	 4.3540988122729765
conversationoh mr collins	 3.501493326340007
into silence and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the	 4.20346034449641
giving you certain information on that head than myselffor i have been	 3.8409105831040535
affection whatever on the occasion mrs bennet could hardly comprehend	 3.668460407990584
next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky	 3.6428559150245765
hertfordshire every body is disgusted with his pride you will not find	 4.721612931087632
lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her	 3.4360968665596463
hunsford and lady catherine de bourghit vexed her to see him	 5.063873973311119
his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his	 3.4541786934711163
and blushed again with shame and vexation she could not help frequently	 4.340465747278046
the sense and disposition of bothi will only say farther that	 3.5499190790501016
descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as	 4.365147618297388
she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which	 3.9727989594329807
owing to himself that wickhams worthlessness had not been so well	 3.7300201187634245
and be careful to write explicitly we have judged it best that my	 4.585721391794533
was every reason to believe would be attended to and in the clamorous	 3.4723344536801326
against you had they been indifferent or had they even been	 3.368654304114161
a creature as ever livedand her nieces are very pretty behaved girls	 3.6017558609982445
if you do	 3.8113468376910884
figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own	 3.021847803341358
interferingand elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and	 3.2735437976653117
amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you	 4.964610181145006
near so much like a ball	 3.625004367927605
cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which	 4.63182115152985
great not handsome enough to dance with i wish you had been there my	 3.1746625034589178
the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more	 3.4282684150932297

ones own daughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr	 3.4084944784486235
you to stay two months i told mrs collins so before you came there	 3.2067132006369796
elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such	 4.004193576706747
would make you sonay were your friend lady catherine to know me i	 3.670146290312976
news of them	 3.82723797285564
complaisancebut in vain mary would not understand them such an	 2.8852300235256934
no one but mrs bennet regretted that their stay would be so short and	 3.6764331208944867
goodness	 1.919964484944678

return it	 3.9936872316538725
placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find	 3.810850950660174
elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by	 3.5466195601001376
not to hear in a doleful voice mrs bennet thus began the projected	 3.671725199895498
a misfortune to be liked by him mrs long told me last night that he	 3.529467140331654
it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment	 2.70844714277981
my uncle is to send a servant for us	 3.659517981179608
she is saving enough there is nothing extravagant in their	 3.714106749798384
secondthe younger ones out before the elder are marriedyour	 3.6147326677811598
merely on that account for in general you know they visit no new	 3.219212818327231
my dear aunt this is being serious indeed	 3.1568739453770425
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered miss	 3.654926626308814
the usual price of an earls younger son unless the elder brother is	 3.5722897202404864
opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song	 4.579495204518793
finer symptoms is not general incivility the very essence of love	 4.550504421820187
it may do very well for the others replied mr bingley but i am	 3.5138125324366705
oh yeshe was to come there with wickham you know but gracious me	 3.6688693819219984
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of	 2.962874285622682
persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town	 3.565191116074885
sisters mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man i am	 3.69764222954978
which occupied them lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table	 3.6472170468893257
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to	 4.599722780855539
my dear niece	 3.332728074730771
known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage	 4.3406985857391165
i can much more easily believe mr bingleys being imposed on than	 3.341473559253071
therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to	 3.694801966349521
of conversing easily with those i have never seen before i cannot	 3.431028883415838
elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mr	 3.5431097522925517
as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption	 3.469565887171758
necessity must be obeyedand farther apology would be absurdi	 4.409283028267498
the others returned into the house mr collins no sooner saw the two	 3.3447581377682605
i am not going to run away papa said kitty fretfully if i	 3.522882188609779

and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy	 4.831986682788279
she found that she was to receive no other answerand after a short	 4.417618551382429
his real character had information been in her power she had never	 3.829958920135809

considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up	 4.411509537946453
that mr wickham had accepted their uncles invitation and was then in	 2.9564385321396824

elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath	 3.8473145183922584
while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the	 2.9574881022886608
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married	 3.566344372656916
i hope you are well miss bennet that lady i suppose is your mother	 3.5809454560459333

silent till they reached the house their father then went to the	 3.3640270131780605
catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman for	 3.343107457108953

you are quite right to have his errors made public might ruin him for	 3.4251433774124664
dearest jane who could have done less for her but make a virtue of it	 4.378807006026153
time not disagreeably we have certainly done our best and most	 3.451888854678619
of what might be called economy in her own private expences she	 4.0231508544486765
and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her	 3.528693228890719
assemblies and that mrs long has promised to introduce him	 3.568870929352681
when he has nothing to do	 3.6068404723022587
declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the	 3.541836947822059
printed for t egerton	 2.445832888276311
perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had	 3.738511337866394
comehe is indeed make haste make haste here sarah come to miss	 3.337828504350959
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests darcy said	 3.657542483169
inclined to take immediate advantage of	 3.2670868580914854
variety of thought reconsidering events determining probabilities	 3.4393091110902665
object of prey to any body at brighton she will be of less importance	 4.339903904992605
ready to believe for every bodys sake that she may feel something	 3.2864688639252146
unblemished could make him in that case he would return no more lady	 3.381026617528716
not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your	 4.0077034464256815
have nothing to guide us colonel forster will i dare say do every	 4.391183968237919
yes or i will never see her again	 3.599617274222996
staredmany smiled but no one looked more amused than mr bennet	 4.042834224347109
make way for her and live to see her take my place in it	 3.6043546546575898
it is wholly out of my power you must feel it and the usual	 3.3366719110636733
sight	 4.313083387772474
of seeing you at pemberley today	 3.7387340366196042
waiter must not hear as if he cared i dare say he often hears worse	 3.789680360402536
girl for the next ten years i will take you to a review at the end of	 4.375474822582372
not a word of wishing to see me again and was in every respect so	 3.5765491443634994
come darcy said he i must have you dance i hate to see you	 4.371232530877032
an excellent library	 3.421011853965937
i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more	 3.209096271137504
lydias voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open and	 4.355819180770977
about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the	 3.41285176639659
family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that	 3.524264464994402
i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourites guilt	 3.5626721559421237
had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful	 3.315811531215546
would be nothing i could see him with perfect indifference but i can	 3.613469621576979
bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield	 3.1773271574553235
pride prejudice	 2.7743631503306823
twelvemonths abode in the family might have prompted after discharging	 4.23309123580313
paragraph 1c below there are a lot of things you can do with project	 4.079763518781853
from the shire as clearly as mr gardiner could do but mrs	 4.6286111875963805
vexation her coming there was the most unfortunate the most illjudged	 3.863414054618638
mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she should be able to shew	 3.510720378309763
curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending	 3.39249495764661
yours ever	 3.874629802762641
oh mr bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar	 3.4759443616233896
then turning to mr bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at	 4.415120580505002
heartily they were wished away by some of the family mrs hurst and her	 3.770784137759597
well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingleybutgood	 3.8090508606136835
longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation	 3.3598560818660754
it was to love of the ladys sensations they remained a little in	 4.356469565398943
circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among	 3.901519622233807
his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to	 3.759484069774337
the latter with regard to new furniture	 3.2843106312164574
had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance but no	 4.726181519323697
their dear friends vulgar relations	 3.1462910028597326
you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate	 4.337913675708401
should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five	 4.236273112067087
displeased by her staying at home	 3.9063928068851532
for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used	 4.043392102989114
venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually	 4.604869518273482
comfort her father captivated by youth and beauty and that appearance	 4.274685176774163
in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant	 3.8325964481126022
that respect his friend had greatly the advantage bingley was sure of	 3.560201725642123
wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing	 4.23564050318401
accents	 1.919964484944678
soon married to mr bingleyit was an animating subject and mrs	 3.7427113145215283
we will go as far as meryton with you said catherine and	 3.096070445903332
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious	 3.77726907556959
elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else and after a pause of	 3.3102529305433745
kitty for hill i will put on my things in a moment my dear dear	 3.9098422717886727
the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating	 4.722688284033388
than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs when they	 4.067658805880066
then i saw him too it was not all settled before monday as soon	 4.332141291290866
at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs hurst and	 3.3709941272421857
the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding	 4.001404615402314
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents	 4.431737560734489
which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful	 4.00890322760655
beauty	 4.211552074329749
inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny but your	 4.092249797912782
elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike	 3.9205091449972023
it was time to be at home	 3.3617561407964143
lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia had	 3.7309402347005403
achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i	 3.6613234844895333
when the card tables were placed he had an opportunity of obliging her	 4.7979792585201695
himselffrom whom she had previously received the information of his	 3.972792285855384
wishes for your health and happiness	 3.393437482991164
young ladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a	 3.5482624843110653
informing her of their intention i must conclude for i cannot be	 4.0866879820404876
upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for	 2.994801266247183
had been valued by his friend here was knowledge in which no one could	 3.4900413345749213
every member of their respective houses and what is to divide them the	 5.473944579047406
readiness and ease of a wellbred man and talked very pleasantly but	 4.010573441802
on reaching the house they were shewn through the hall into the saloon	 4.069551346789449
acquired by trade	 2.8857178333638513
the colour now rushed into elizabeths cheeks in the instantaneous	 3.268048489032117
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given	 3.5289778963491307
did conquer her fathers incredulity and reconcile him to the match	 5.248067868017047
the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the	 3.5715230600337344
she is grown so brown and coarse louisa and i were agreeing that we	 5.109537812093504
as you describe mr bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl	 4.284984620520442
from the drawingroom they could distinguish nothing in the lane and	 3.8984841360839684
my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly	 3.1122449553482068
liked a red coat myself very welland indeed so i do still at my heart	 4.135973922220803
done which satisfied her his style was not penitent but haughty it	 4.451890324277958
such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once no	 3.262720746735522
consequent explanations	 2.0712554686369473
repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and	 4.329018995804196
each to be dwelt on farther	 5.221152648268921
contrary he was all attention to every body by nature inoffensive	 3.306844783189772
money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared	 3.209751385352513
jane i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get	 3.548651723108465
indeed you are mistaken madam i have not been at all able to account	 3.3341949074288424
and if he does colonel forster will hire him my aunt told me so	 3.551963565408173
he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here	 3.5027048069612654
for good news the letter was read aloud mrs bennet could hardly	 3.757611573820801
seen it in the papers it was in the times and the courier i know	 6.374760457380031
together in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the housekeeper	 4.272480804756037
afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr darcys	 5.920403733057845
remembering what charlottes opinion had always beenneither could she	 3.5984469096166087
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but mr collins	 3.7557250351981963
between the parties	 2.9158972081656733
i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my	 3.2707651355993868
if elizabeth when mr darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to	 3.56317336688529
up to him as a superior your lively talents would place you in the	 3.429606901455081
every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world and	 4.224630244372247
good gracious cried mrs bennet as she stood at a window the next	 3.8072133791268334
aye so it is cried her mother and mrs long does not come back	 3.4635128022971777
the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing	 4.403489745279223

many months ago from mr wickham on this subject what can you have to	 3.8355954848259195

elizabeth said no morebut her mind could not acquiesce the	 3.8786762831063792
opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody	 3.766740638857811

came from it the coach therefore took them the first stage of their	 4.112243941538534

her when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy who took	 3.6448471641542426
children after the decease of yourself and my sister and	 4.792576960470334
jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their	 4.300044761879551
with a look of doubt	 3.246968896794438
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf	 4.742402160916951
it was my brother gardiners drawing up too and i wonder how he came to	 3.185320981832653
i give to hear your strictures on them	 3.4811481528967363
miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction	 3.545412381440465
by all means my good qualities are under your protection and you are	 3.485807628873404
i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon	 3.2909935155591907
i do not recollect that we did	 3.682758599708349
father had been short and to the purpose	 3.750026264851533
images of the original pages are available through	 3.737902887210605
she ran into the room her mother stepped forwards embraced her and	 5.368318417882488
give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of	 3.5844215554907164
want to think you perfect and you set yourself against it do not be	 3.250754555584628
when you have killed all your own birds mr bingley said her mother	 4.300083036360529
give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them	 3.6130065768564417
cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style and which	 4.301491349152547
my dearest lizzy	 2.9856868663086287
my style of writing is very different from yours	 3.142178857668292
each of them and in the mean time she went after dinner to shew her	 3.5253689381442355
she enquired after his sister but could do no more	 3.466388325306494
husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me but	 3.422415339255598
the marriage of her sisters he bore with philosophy the conviction that	 4.356009118030409
but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham	 3.6866734014670555
miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and	 3.950089455126393
oh dear yesbut you must own she is very plain lady lucas herself	 4.033303359173474
his cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear	 3.7055136273670386
inconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity	 4.382964717081576
actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her he never	 3.489062391010725
elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though	 3.3640079911860576
just as you please	 3.9898922150486382
she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages	 4.02287119100147
or why did he thus come a day before he was expected had they been	 3.573542834519482
cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his	 3.4436189402863655
they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to	 3.797167264123684
other had ever seen him bingley of course returned with him to dinner	 3.5040188178103735
when they approached her she said to miss bennet i beg your pardon	 4.333145227162017
master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed	 3.4912261006215686
selfdestined to another	 3.711586587877919
i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment	 3.1105834178081913
so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george	 3.5610734590424107
either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at	 4.9339554203289815
gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of	 4.21951612454283
him whether he intended to accept mr bingleys invitation and if he	 3.3426202084614407
catherine the old lady is mrs jenkinson who lives with them the	 3.9903052461493917
could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her	 3.237523847941649
did whether he would think it proper to join in the evenings	 3.528671891266667
a long dispute followed this declaration but mr bennet was firm it	 3.880810077501556
letter which promises well i am impatient to see him	 4.055745001035063
jane shook her head	 3.2987981924739582
brother for talking such nonsense	 3.5058651107600074
she herself had been barbarously used by them all and on these two	 4.351144296844354
again and again it was hardly enough but it pleased her she was even	 3.2650919527949087
certainly did not hate him no hatred had vanished long ago and she	 4.430324182493504
again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command she	 3.994662632928665
she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup	 4.0074950982582065
trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which	 6.469731664274605
you have yes there was something in that i told you so from the	 3.4881254270212168
moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it a report of a most	 3.931166741598331
why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley i am	 3.4710724337562167
the will the difference was great what wickham had said of the living	 3.7136253390936114
weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace she could neither	 4.0145023860735565
are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking	 3.683938677876837
prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute	 3.159552037109133
my dear sir	 2.7161168620570524
because the miss bennets were come away when her civility was claimed	 3.417875296215863
from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally	 3.5198972577771714
there with his friends permission or being bold enough to come	 3.7887032667271487
and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect	 4.240913839075772
occasion of dictating to others in the intervals of her discourse with	 4.679570288005879
to a ragout had nothing to say to her	 3.616349388894113
nothing greaterhe carved and ate and praised with delighted	 5.301814314144782
others and she had no opportunity of detaining them	 4.251959851935135
they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night on	 3.7012466948827316

place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been	 3.8638785150130053
serviceand perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as	 3.4432517740307964
of music than myself or a better natural taste if i had ever learnt i	 3.522457687260601
late to be saving mrs bennet had no turn for economy and her	 5.072058482401054
improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell	 3.5341915218487716
them	 2.779467724834706
feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his	 4.499833795939047
elizabeth looked surprised the gentleman experienced some change of	 3.1486737683082815
concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had	 3.7241974688321426
no i believe not	 3.3168117990987915
mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and	 3.1602136065346955
must have been benefited by marriage but he found in reply to	 3.392756971834388
for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any	 3.6764679078762263
liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a	 3.6689374489284337
manner observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he	 4.758855633572401
there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he	 3.1545618176660875
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state if therefore she	 3.29799274612644
chapter xiv	 1.9160620946979579
and i ought to feel it	 3.537534935174716
soon dispatched for though dilatory in undertaking business he was	 4.7696705121464085
his concern at having been prevented by business they then went away	 3.1208018544619254
fancied herself nervous the business of her life was to get her	 3.942753256682804
you would certainly not be here till tomorrow and indeed before we	 3.1918719568277423
away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of	 3.6730387119642685
what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud	 4.7413235557987345
now kitty you may cough as much as you chuse said mr bennet and	 3.381067608884238
this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of	 3.4296651183290834
pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited	 3.634967784023068
taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the	 4.7873524656489534
been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his	 4.089369835122876
so totally independent of every one	 4.504097783960158
the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from	 4.515663519498007
much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively and	 3.9458080579840025
will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt	 3.4949014766910356
in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that	 3.695600743523562

impossible not to long to know	 3.2687110543997537
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantlepiece the	 4.400289692993215
application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited	 3.5279717084990603
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of	 4.2413827286642185
his pleasure	 3.865541933128696
had elizabeths opinion been all drawn from her own family she could	 4.049410835724402

and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr bennet were dead she	 4.219680947107502
cannoti have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly	 3.6531762861850474
sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around	 4.2937170385480385
anne could not have appeared with propriety in a different manneri	 4.186512726250549
i began to be afraid you would never come back again people did say	 3.342974322131618
gone off to scotland with one of his officers to own the truth	 4.243793350448232
with an air of distant civility mr collins however was not	 2.8513202158362407
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility mr darcy looked	 3.725176190998762
his brotherinlaws intreaty that he would return to his family and	 4.40620068468055
certainly not	 3.487388667194552
yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but that	 3.3973756397582635
the day of his and lydias departure soon came and mrs bennet was	 3.4915445060107024
and she rose as she spoke lady catherine rose also and they turned	 3.3760532953284557
regiment after such an affront to colonel forster his temptation is	 4.222933058487434
very bad it is almost past belief and poor mr darcy dear lizzy only	 3.0922929399187535
by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she	 3.944416824524505
he is as fine a fellow said mr bennet as soon as they were out of	 3.723305439268193

sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and	 3.8712834219723735
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other	 3.7344049468308205
large party of friends how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own	 3.341681151167412
matter it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should	 4.693619373291364
as they concerned george wickham what a stroke was this for poor jane	 3.4397577619495805
outside the united states us laws alone swamp our small staff	 3.2611616615718595
learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we	 3.1291549030125276
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the	 4.705702830771777

little time thereforei shall certainly try to get the better	 3.802948832094681
indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored	 3.2839770798654633
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without	 3.2317858601901714

to be in a hurry i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first	 3.535258423066929
disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last	 4.8722194611017615

honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on	 3.5140270730174623
well over the agitations of former partiality entirely so she had even	 4.0320493484288
from pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her	 3.406977602287651
these are home questionsand perhaps i cannot say that i have	 3.265736693344793
my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza said	 3.519564938867863
elizabeth asked questions in vain maria would tell her nothing more	 3.196215052816889
seeking him up stairs with their mother when they were met by the	 3.501204499008022
she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets	 4.23035557743556
out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling to think	 4.883988316943317
wickhams attentions there could be no conversation in the noise of	 3.4296733114406304
to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known	 5.012417577296409
would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart but to be sure	 3.748784769788831
the girls stared at their father mrs bennet said only nonsense	 3.3129869343390066
exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he	 4.202149023169658
in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your	 4.065932014387384
imaginary but still he would be her husbandwithout thinking highly	 3.3384551974016348
lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said	 3.8411237471696063
seeing him	 3.4495919744731136
seemed to imply it could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts	 3.835506139147413
this would be nothing if you really liked him	 3.4208534172151954
he is indeedbut considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we	 3.6666641957423174
distinguished no part of the scene her thoughts were all fixed on that	 3.7160442086502243
in this mannerin such society and indeed i am quite of your opinion	 3.5578184928253016

so small a collection of bookswhat a delightful library you have at	 4.234331272398035
conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and	 3.782078788729374
help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a	 3.80222669378539
of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of	 3.2633641432423195
as you i am certain remember with the design of soon	 3.4473251977018737
but on returning to the drawingroom when her letter was finished she	 4.8043153563332135
suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs	 3.858193426064324

my cousin elizabeth	 3.8396548857234167
and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it it is	 3.6188960132268533
sometimes one must speak a little you know it would look odd to be	 3.574561333934664
his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention	 4.038724935546052

i never saw any one so shocked he could not speak a word for full ten	 3.2885408538292444
trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on	 5.331871545283092
jane my dear dear lizzy i wouldi do congratulate youbut are you	 4.1549956351784285
as yours seems to have been he came to tell mr gardiner that	 3.934660163006703
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready	 4.3966610180056795
imputed to my getting wet through yesterday my kind friends will	 3.81911624500625
parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of	 4.509252017321802
elizabeth you are not serious now	 3.787031794847155
mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a	 3.6708615799191127
for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it	 3.271350389817382
concernand the world in general would have too much sense to join in	 3.291028324473782
and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least	 3.929834673004061
that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged she would not	 4.136951507084417

are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you	 3.644774979494229

elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley	 3.767568271572256
detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought	 3.4894200063765863
of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which shewed her	 4.235166641266127

very well we now come to the point your mother insists upon your	 3.431077337151734
arrival at lambton these visitors came they had been walking about the	 3.6498549703773167

in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and	 4.5322353229004255

you must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon mature	 3.4715135392897825
when one has a motive only three miles i shall be back by dinner	 3.4325432453801183
connubial felicity really was an union of a different tendency and	 4.962156200374086

she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road	 4.624081621607123
me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i	 4.3247069110783904
forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means	 5.123524418990883
does not agree to the terms of the full project gutenbergtm	 2.8279422484769965

miss bennet still looked all amazement elizabeth again and more	 3.295578694522324
i was never more annoyed the insipidity and yet the noise the	 3.88784187539377
to insist upon her marrying him	 3.450411783609235
perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better	 3.206949440259494
of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some	 4.72309308297494
talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the	 5.786266114947217
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right	 5.4041275813673115
had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if	 3.8395300616132273

such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to	 3.024070420014324

have been gladly and gratefully received he was as generous she	 4.7788067981916615
enough for expectation	 3.824878807834366
occurred it would be dreadful she blushed at the very idea and	 5.014318539114737
drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do he delighted in	 3.5057160592267005
it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an illnatured tone that	 4.888250130667557
extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others	 3.1779483149107914
elizabeths spirits were so high on the occasion that though she did	 3.7871631460068294
elizabeth longed to observe that mr bingley had been a most delightful	 4.578253731429661

alacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir	 4.0312243705232085
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire about the court such	 4.010654530971166

conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim	 4.3063104415869775
you are very cruel said her sister you will not let me smile and	 3.7096473326212482
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants	 4.138728533060345

whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general	 4.45595715257227
nothing more to plague her on his account	 4.771518736032464
cousins praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she	 3.3558111410579543

arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of	 3.854294928360936
these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted instead of	 3.7863759480435917

regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their	 3.571364003132424

declined eating any thing and then rising up said to elizabeth	 3.5412066959212494
you look conscious young ladies have great penetration in such matters	 3.8107832667422454
much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestowhow much of	 4.006469233309871
though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for	 3.524134474578254
approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the	 4.024902426830552

happy with him	 3.8153312092591753
principally offended mr darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct	 4.867192402829957
while she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to	 3.0485837711474413
of her own she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion	 4.5197253819731396
i did not think caroline in spirits were her words but she was very	 3.2491741721496203
jane in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness	 4.132294034130714
bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant and the respect which he	 4.708461381170279
may have drawn him in	 4.400395411945372
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it	 3.5958638586561307
would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of	 4.496132390369274
eliza bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on her is	 4.366247622806444
mr bennets property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two	 3.1470045710820447
walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party	 3.9473117081266853
money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there then shewing	 3.7436644685661444
the death of darcys father five years before it was yet in his power	 3.015026404209129
ambition will ever be gratified i came to try you i hoped to find you	 4.028896081267484
in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an	 3.841531329251896
acquaintance the subjection in which his father had brought him up had	 4.11710413196296
women better worth their notice let us hope therefore that her being	 3.2956595239717803
from epsom all that is known after this is that they were seen	 3.803645857001284
elizabeth that if left wholly to himself janes happiness and his	 3.2161908432295307
mr collinss triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete	 3.4900268055226467
as i might have done but the horror of what might possibly happen	 4.616107209817981
to send her away and there are several of the young men too that she	 3.537457188283655
aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming i can now	 5.365666533983359
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away unwilling as she	 5.209347311420913
extraordinary in them they have a sharp shrewish look which i do not	 4.393866993777238
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe	 3.9593307916929756
my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to	 3.434187521606347
she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse	 3.7584930086537844
allow herself to stay with her sister or say half that remained to be	 3.3008298679446573

down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much	 4.04293220629333
said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of	 3.7625733409781814
in love as much as she chuses	 4.055942538634992
on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be	 3.921655046633424

you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into	 3.4007062359408815
are you quite sure maamis not there a little mistake said	 3.5610321000178176
and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her	 3.9524613414130214
unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his	 4.261130783512518

elizabeth after the health of her family she answered him in the usual	 3.2044491817232625
sorry it went off but these things happen so often a young man such	 3.558496987588228
children of his own and may have more how could he spare half ten	 3.925646016791276
mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he	 3.0951828922959814
international donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make	 3.5163760765516145
objections and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his	 3.1457120093127426
no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing	 4.948099687954367
of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on	 4.0218684543742675

party at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting	 4.566092768100876
received and noticed as he was perhaps there was some truth in	 3.8337807146231966
collins then returned to elizabeth	 3.471176622525242
elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour at	 3.1205369940087353

though often standing within a very short distance of her quite	 3.385927386128656
child and now heres mr bennet gone away and i know he will fight	 4.157085120086468

lydias character excuse mefor i must speak plainly if you my dear	 4.066318827330379

there is an express come for master from mr gardiner he has been here	 3.510891357589465
she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr	 3.841945555297407

and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be	 3.2442680806861244

the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the	 3.276519628027296
mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his	 3.1457920805378143

what sort of a girl is miss darcy	 3.7431202043109555
what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and mr	 3.748444749000736

your ladyship has declared it to be impossible	 3.288624477379357
assurance i require	 4.323313445013802
the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far	 3.116737421653545
and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good	 2.917475308693457
in your eyes i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life	 3.6704058850557844

mr gardiner whose manners were easy and pleasant encouraged her	 3.110915872436689
she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had	 5.053697825089047
him if you do not	 3.424630910035565
brought him from london and that he was to have a lieutenants	 4.706025863604041

unhappy there may be error and there may be misery thoughtlessness	 4.459576345967197
receive the last finish i believe i have now told you every thing	 3.5922264264929624
they should not object to know more of miss bennet was therefore	 3.672191049754798

me for she does not know which are the best warehouses oh brother	 3.7638166224248173

when to these recollections was added the developement of wickhams	 4.6370771255362575
them in the course of the day but mrs bennet who had calculated on	 3.8027233445195043
hate you i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take	 3.374842470517093
scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning but	 3.7762423209210287
elizabeth smiled	 3.9810920128010374

approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to	 3.457804102916481

well jane who is it from what is it about what does he say well	 3.441511829293704

good heaven can it be really so yet now i must believe you cried	 3.163871644566654
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds	 3.6570574486508294

reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it	 5.039613186184028
frailty would have mortified her so much not however from any fear of	 3.6252912787804576
cannot help blaming her she was very wrong in singling me out as	 4.568799392817963

whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well the more i see	 3.676842050573264
reproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever	 3.5655170752855683

moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had	 3.9858235978878263

rather louder than any other persons was enumerating the various	 4.199122297913243

from which she had been so wholly free at first her ease and good	 3.9763718102185117
bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he	 4.294901883124072

mr bennet treated the matter differently so lizzy said he one day	 3.535147724128232
by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and	 4.202046104572142
with the phrase project gutenberg associated with or appearing on the	 3.5943661470402084

falsehood he has imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to	 3.698627106299898
ever so similar beforehand it does not advance their felicity in the	 4.74799171466094
of my own child but to be sure janeone does not often see any body	 3.789518412374689
elizabeth made no objectionthe door was then allowed to be shut and	 3.26589415646203
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the	 4.316376211135528
you would have spoken if i had not asked you my resolution of	 3.575302743928558

of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being	 3.403402749210452
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty but if	 3.9690896506853837
nonsensical to come at all why must she be scampering about the	 3.4866654794492513
pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have	 3.7079347520981885
which she might in future be able to dispense	 3.160414442656981
what do you mean hill we have heard nothing from town	 3.19021257701351
have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you	 4.167009700300502
approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter	 4.181728534328086

laughing myself at your surprise tomorrow morning as soon as i am	 3.152526349333769
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it	 3.8018508458385645
she found herself so affectionately received she saw instantly that her	 3.375081041432843

delayed i have not an instant to lose	 3.8357215455252733

letter appeared and she was completely puzzled	 3.972374937763048
way i shall offer to pay him tomorrow he will rant and storm about	 5.019692238620176
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickham has created a	 4.233338415973617
bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox well now	 4.817336745606836
of either lady catherine or her daughter colonel fitzwilliam had called	 3.3792790286664167
on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and	 3.46602514311031
she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each	 3.364181065110081
their engagement his friend had given him the earliest information of	 3.7642087471843118
still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth what do i not	 3.4504510527615158
you who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy will readily	 3.475580067137651
county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three	 4.630278113615181
could at all forgive their daughter	 4.352615689742764
edw gardiner	 2.813677300159217
do you talk by rule then while you are dancing	 3.3346723654947166
the next ball we meet with great pleasure i shall send for my	 3.4252719233979527
pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her	 3.299970015130688
behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest	 4.04297168246119
darcys but you shall do as you chuse	 3.826269785435296
remarks of the two ladies and mr darcy the latter of whom however	 4.194020558626464
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow	 3.8888429150381576
my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to was a question	 3.309933787818908
almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to	 3.3618331887319712
make her visitors forget their inferior rank she was not rendered	 4.358271436067175
dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a	 3.8641748449390083
officers who in comparison with the stranger were become stupid	 3.506049877813111
retaining mr bingley for his sister	 3.5406939211773256
enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford she	 3.394152698514893
as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no	 2.9336402881063277
that mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn	 3.6620521546646487
engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many	 3.8039104484080704
near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of	 3.631742458118499
jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his	 4.553963946690955
another	 3.8239185801136983
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and	 4.668084307854201
that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask a ladys	 3.145271711861775
not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood	 3.4422382385792067
oh mary said she i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun	 3.6472085015120697
the present always occupies you in such scenesdoes it said he	 4.038815093640175
catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying	 3.1492183388404693
fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that	 3.593033860462265
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then	 3.329677910328443
preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right	 4.278879859044267
she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of	 3.5741430040397524
lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in	 3.629267755195306
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement this is not	 4.615908248452987
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property	 3.6757044057960924
such as creation of derivative works reports performances and	 5.400527319297463
you may depend upon my not mentioning it	 2.5746970428068843
oh shocking cried miss bingley i never heard any thing so	 3.413724733748844
habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five	 3.6789863531336335
i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly	 3.650634986110032
for heavens sake madam speak lowerwhat advantage can it be to you	 3.3330123712337705
proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone	 3.120183814880498
allwhat all five out at once very oddand you only the	 3.146977755614565
lovely and amiable when darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley	 4.402706510901422
herself and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion	 3.8078141707993596
mrs bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments	 2.949611410755709
mannerone whom his father had promised to provide forit is	 4.325723280171518
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and	 4.412873695798607
you are all kindness madam but i believe we must abide by our	 3.5771368104090584
you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas but however i hope	 4.43188010105623
looks	 4.205598325075622
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general i	 4.154611791656492
sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham	 3.3670340459431687
accede to his proposal i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a	 3.809138868629207
property of some one or other of their daughters	 3.4309044444993035
this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour	 5.025521977183149
succeeds but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art	 4.620796329012383
which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned her eye on	 4.740279325484481
agitation cried out	 3.2580211502559573
those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what	 3.7544833953636387
on these occasions mrs gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeths	 5.02039756281245
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence	 3.539444200870817
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the project	 3.7056716071477505
the others then joined her and expressed their admiration of his	 3.1285535736618098
when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in	 3.3445868539998567
to london i was right therefore my last letter had never reached her	 3.187324061586218
great perseverance yet time and her aunt moved slowlyand her patience	 3.6152508535816903
admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because	 3.938020314226758
sincerely	 1.919964484944678
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them any thing was a	 3.2609268592850174
in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow	 4.030258971303207
bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period	 4.117579025317042
means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and	 4.075542310585177
he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring i had not	 4.007563777307863
arrival of her master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot	 3.2093020337818094
it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should	 3.407096402947274
miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cards she is a great	 3.7020024236985716
yes yes they must marry there is nothing else to be done but there	 3.801401252060857
into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his	 5.040348726421985
comers indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us to visit	 3.7617011448594027
handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks	 4.017442834712877
there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening	 3.635217359513581
wonder why all this was not told you last night but i was not then	 3.7731566780429873
my dear lizzy	 2.95946358140643
of matrimony in his parish secondly that i am convinced it will add	 4.451492955326574
doubted not as the most generous of his sex but while he was mortal	 4.34515801040822
of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree	 3.9455605795870983
to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together after	 4.558840817567305
are removed of course we hope that you will support the project	 3.5215134462102866
otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your	 3.564250291592137
looking rooms walked on	 3.310039789840932
his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his	 4.865843935672797
elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of	 5.331750361220819
engagements that had been made for him he had never before supposed	 3.9176674783535788
making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally	 3.862769527669269
name of your admirer this letter is from mr collins	 4.474540557513541
report is spread abroad	 3.817263596266346
you	 3.1674854970706803
she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her	 3.905443168140498
but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the	 3.346069668021577
darcy had walked away to another part of the room she followed him with	 3.851850199709416
of it again to anybody i told my sister philips so the other day but i	 3.76643610807237
very different man from what he is to the less prosperous his pride	 3.836208196092323
nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his	 3.5372083764994415
glancing her eye at mr darcy though every glance convinced her of what	 3.208012219972275
countenance elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first	 3.8364275814338247
way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and	 4.4164210732505005
imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love	 3.779293193939965
when the door opened and to her very great surprise mr darcy and mr	 3.839264706993918
added kitty	 3.6542705835707423
all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of	 3.061332111655485
expressively at lydia but she who never heard nor saw any thing of	 2.9385892655755312
compatible with the profession of a clergymani do not mean however to	 3.9054487215625855
thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his	 4.831408218270057
should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of	 4.863772689801363
upon my wordwell that was very decided indeedthat does seem as	 4.353065704973452
to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be	 3.6172670783016003
kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove no	 3.6674272195645017
bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed	 3.2558179972370347
circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour	 4.413199246422031
my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the	 5.276463668300155
after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a	 4.818645914895258
jane who was the general favourite and whose steady sense and	 3.271888406597851
unequally they may be returned it is natural that obligation should be	 3.0308683094828166
interruptions of mr collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with	 3.9550038717320795
darcy mentioned his letter did it said he did it soon make you	 3.4652401299144686
at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few	 3.8708733225451226

so much such a countenance such manners and so extremely	 3.1137155158819576
women in the room and which he thought the prettiest and his	 5.025176708320374
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first	 3.7362230670654797
that mr collins should be able to procure any womans good opinion	 3.776915189021337
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set	 3.17514757918727
influenced by my hopes or fearsi did not believe her to be	 3.6819054373794513
seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she i am	 4.263001712784845
i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth but i do not	 3.781154020248719
however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to	 3.7140678927211006
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me	 4.17534787795506
the neighbourhood were drooping apace the dejection was almost	 5.36256633801955
is not this nice is not this an agreeable surprise	 3.905157567923561
in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced	 3.3645162778511803
lydia declared herself satisfied oh yesit would be much better to	 3.731818939571597
be marriedi shall see her againshe will be married at sixteenmy	 3.6345887119614932
oh yesthat that is the worst of all till i was in kent and saw	 4.484055563055824
particular state visit <URL>	 3.3015221669752806
such realities as these what would have been her sensations they could	 4.081049772841269
forth in this agreement you must obtain permission in writing from	 3.0295785367340455
see it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain	 3.9248530097028578
leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded	 3.6176999966989376
yourself and with a low bow he left her to attack mr darcy whose	 4.653028637530191
catherine and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excel	 3.4315554720088284
their visit to rosings mr collins was carefully instructing them in	 4.624651875801425
your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield she	 4.047147636574605
noi cannot talk of books in a ballroom my head is always full of	 3.859718048192356
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion at that instant she felt	 4.758047414923917
appearance of it	 3.3809609935350187
embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the gentlest of	 3.5319975157152084
curtseyed to him without saying a word	 3.2571985182630736
mr collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he	 4.019981979500074
most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me	 3.730414645001524
shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they	 3.8040181088331835
when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly	 3.030901033633323
whom they sprung poor charlotteit was melancholy to leave her to	 4.812099207244605
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire	 4.433129086988045
i see your design bingley said his friendyou dislike an	 3.1424833126177556
thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be	 5.114995446089062
marks nothing bad at heart his choice is disinterested at least	 3.4565351962724113

when he looked at her she stood several minutes before the picture in	 3.4328842906127006

dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken almost as	 3.1744210740155254
i can guess the subject of your reverie	 3.96252245274316
accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those	 3.502156980378078

elizabeths misery increased at such unnecessary such officious	 3.285602178707953
why did not you all learnyou ought all to have learned the miss	 3.8779248787886345
after many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could not	 3.839663909525786
i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship you	 3.9161051461150254
every attempt of mrs bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a	 3.504762654877218
ignorance but with me it is not so painful recollections will	 4.022311360830985
them mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding	 3.7414661498337676
gratification but when mrs philips understood from him what rosings	 3.234954802880831
i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you	 3.760426085692908
likewise turned towards mr darcy with an expression of halflaughing	 3.668592637733029
by other men you had better return to your partner and enjoy her	 3.4006409268570215
the indirect boastfor you are really proud of your defects in	 4.220223540892359
again by her sister	 3.7696865058076625

thought she could witness without trepidation	 3.97842532172764

likes with her	 2.8218823328671077
finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a	 3.4964044575910433
reserved disagreeable girl yet he knew to the contrary himself he	 4.058540147243716
over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked	 3.605434704617536
elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of	 3.0937918774102524
janes disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest	 3.251939536927136
at four oclock therefore we may expect this peacemaking gentleman	 3.3144628192175105
i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be	 3.4959363981836113
assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty	 3.921259305801263
introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in	 3.3148961609276606
aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if	 4.282818740561089

removing all my doubts i am not indebted for my present happiness to	 4.395381791945213
bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydias	 3.5169880460192373
splendor and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings	 4.011190088695485
themselves what a contrast between him and his friend mr darcy danced	 3.9917329914567268
important elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr darcy	 3.577748673829344

asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm while mrs reynolds	 3.7482000087817386
overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the	 3.788851275233654
longer hope to be benefited by it she wanted to hear of him when there	 4.554392475637639

say there will be some little money even when all his debts are	 3.3689228335613075
that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of	 3.80318343144225
lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte	 3.206877994007843

notice the two first dances however brought a return of distress	 3.2763132809091497
so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves	 4.198912793907933
though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his	 3.315403976200589

with mrs hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in	 3.3850684594287856
thing rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory	 4.221979665513012

the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his	 4.032407172314281
and as they drew near the appointed inn where mr bennets carriage was	 4.163514890216343

when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject it	 3.713007007644572
to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of	 3.1559712742740493
conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will	 3.528606290233841

almost every day she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had	 4.315360910393549
country neighbourhood i assure you there is quite as much of that	 3.7383627562009805

mr wickham no i certainly am not but he is beyond all comparison	 3.3393050655903216

extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of	 4.485681862269627
in earnest i speak nothing but the truth he still loves me and we are	 3.5596553269577664

the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits	 4.1699917045094965
fitzwilliams occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was	 4.028581766167129

miss bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone you ought to	 3.156880346288328

elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked	 4.551877749149392
perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very	 4.108341214602684
jane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy	 3.6563682482257773

much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas	 3.97484606577871

wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the	 4.410977441989844

announce her engagement to the family with many compliments to them	 4.145549007666601
dreadful at length in a voice of forced calmness he said	 3.7192437145921624
resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer i pity though i	 4.115196122057417
with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel	 5.003141348303698

formidable by silence but whatever she said was spoken in so	 3.208766214660923
kind friend procured the wishedfor direction they were in	 5.288419136519176
mrs collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often	 3.946147538556549
minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to	 4.231630682639444
imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other	 4.731840319088144
on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession	 3.3620103997829984
most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the	 4.352773235735596
talking to her brother he who had always inspired in herself a respect	 3.460652557484536
with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia	 4.373496646501057

another very welcome surprise for his chief wish at present was to	 3.2137195506290865
through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving mr	 4.032283412338746
as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will	 3.2392841023733143
she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through	 3.9319490050987698
laugh as much as you chuse but you will not laugh me out of my	 3.693569741240072
surprise at her silence	 3.626197898051127
and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for	 3.7078239860173636
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning	 5.1067378495860964
i think she will she is now about miss elizabeth bennets height or	 3.195088400865478
yes maam that he was indeed and his son will be just like himjust	 3.8135637703784924
may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as	 4.42752141920517
and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very	 4.305955204926642
entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely to	 3.724931135120526
friend and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a	 3.5341487633204918
her very best politeness which he returned with as much more	 3.5035949613972215
on the subject	 3.2403687580281573
was most prompt in inviting mr collins to join his daughters in their	 4.3208482108429696
i leave it to yourself to determine said mr bennet	 3.7099362915966525
selfconsequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance could	 3.648805595269962
elizabeth turned away to hide a smile	 4.841708885342777
tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired	 4.460461033012691
not pronounce she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his	 3.7932935913233172
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course my reasons for	 3.2842678459660952
restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield she	 3.504232811879731
bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him	 4.095072941797637
that he is always here so often it is on your account that he has been	 3.626777184243617
just now when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at	 3.8213078490868693
and at length by repeated assurances that mr darcy was really the	 4.359560931667391
returns of the delightful intercourse we have known and in the mean	 3.8881961588196643
curious to hear how it was managed	 3.759130907758181
forbearance and though mrs philips as well as her sister stood in	 3.8814487696449134
forbid it can i speak plainer do not consider me now as an elegant	 3.559035768228044
longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard it	 4.379684835418609
amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to	 3.506287871639237
enough happened in the time good gracious when i went away i am sure	 3.495563474560559
certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i	 3.513720011506832
i must not decide on my own performance	 4.38470611878216
present i have not room to do them justice	 4.0095629302172355
of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished	 3.336880455915689
than a reader was extremely well pleased to close his large book and	 3.719640947420958
me in every respect	 3.7997768915693424
did as the day of his arrival drew near	 3.8107978289283304
my spirits will not bear solitude i must have employment and society	 4.221880158649815
sisters i should not care how proud i was i would keep a pack of	 3.470947028408028
wickham lydia were all forgotten jane was beyond competition her	 3.874102542916209
i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham i can	 3.8606861491601747
this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of	 3.162630480151244
raptures as mr collins expected the scene to inspire and was but	 4.302011405300827
and intelligence which might supply it among themselves if there were	 3.4193973906782333
calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a	 3.8248516654678446
on the very last day of the regiments remaining in meryton he dined	 5.012484149424069
he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take	 4.578062145296226
mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her	 2.955895096368667
that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass	 4.000346171427402
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such	 4.254835794411635
elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning	 3.552977306574097
sister ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to	 4.020596941637389
would have gone on if you had been left to yourself i wonder when	 3.5031774460466987
make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she	 3.753427342465221
little to fix the attention of a stranger elizabeth walked on in quest	 3.8547500417897664
jane i congratulate you you will be a very happy woman	 4.6900001515156635
being spoke to	 3.6314083894611398
longbourn mr gardiner was a sensible gentlemanlike man greatly	 3.565487553578728
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however	 3.7757465308478033
elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the	 4.280657852872621
when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant	 3.3023496520304496
mr collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight but his	 3.5002534117389135
catherines carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter	 4.5200689050633525
she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means there were	 3.445725529372035
herself and sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction	 4.0673870959070495
claimed their relationship would have delighted them all elizabeth had	 3.7428388282934106
i did not know before that you ever walked this way	 2.7422114233826247
elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him	 4.0704331375488
what does mr darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my	 4.053334528531286
would be wisdom to resist all that i can promise you therefore is not	 3.7459917154785853
feel it	 3.2964308520995877
bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to	 3.4644845600203666
my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncles	 3.2891246130276173
when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley	 3.6230018672798145
but elizabeth was not formed for illhumour and though every prospect	 4.0952734337083
she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked	 4.77133532825595
the servants through an antichamber to the room where lady catherine	 4.399283578848666
who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an	 3.558015637899363
catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a	 3.951745923585506
and fainter and in farther justification of mr darcy she could not	 4.204932236468471
bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to rail	 4.069972180144612
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or	 3.8703143029658307
you never see a fault in any body all the world are good and agreeable	 4.285459937824519
gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her	 4.608570870216114
cheeks and she said	 2.9827203389663848
it	 3.3390109840308284
uncle would most readily have settled the whole they battled it	 3.4075547664760024
herself his apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were over	 3.9816612428862874
done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present	 4.23758354694379
elizabeth was distressed she felt that she had no business at	 3.706337636319501
tenderly she even shook hands with the formerelizabeth took leave of	 3.772300211940844
militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship	 3.823952065569155
ramsgate last summer i made a point of her having two men servants go	 3.274394293916522
that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to	 4.189862665758886
interesting object to all my acquaintance were i distractedly in love	 4.218472533839668
this and all associated files of various formats will be found in	 5.389588289366037
each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the	 4.391511313425105
she will drop the acquaintance entirely	 4.210143066758702
my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for	 3.6579513456759267
day her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long before it	 3.6048394058505497
natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings she was	 3.348607004944918
attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near	 3.3806379134489553
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again the promised	 3.4470384737918227
such a risk but against this there were objections and she finally	 3.885753870306355
that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four	 3.5985315067172796
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any	 3.3079015614682294

electronic work is discovered and reported to you within <NUMBER> days	 4.785483639422803
will not take comfort in mine believe her to be deceived by all means	 3.3033478403180703
kitty had not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we	 5.570908573567017
for being coherent dearest lizzy i hardly know what i would	 3.150635307116014
dearest friend but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many	 3.256394849360616
feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in	 4.442174111277877
my dear mr bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard that	 3.2578183191216548
i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment	 4.409008876699631
that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely	 3.606047166476866
he should be particularly happy at any time c c and if she would	 3.4905892265715868
wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of	 3.8733254745140315
breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by	 4.2575949914471725
charlotte wisely did not hear after sitting long enough to admire every	 3.9112090486502953
to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the	 4.333283685498075
and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into	 3.567350282958991
yours c	 2.735569880486294
for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle and you saw the	 4.1005648578122775
the inns in barnet and hatfield but without any success no such	 4.490292479382226
think it is well expressed	 3.557912753406077
you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my	 3.554839084517037
his misfortunes repeated darcy contemptuously yes his misfortunes	 3.0568619890706312
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she	 3.876952347096814
sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the	 3.487234489814179
result from the success of his endeavours and when even the	 4.34013380524471
venison was roasted to a turnand everybody said they never saw so fat	 4.480149522518105
pemberley was now georgianas home and the attachment of the sisters	 3.7627635770373002
two days after mr bennets return as jane and elizabeth were walking	 3.4166087705369637
hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running down stairs	 3.299246672011548
trust i am resigned perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my	 3.9391564635186733
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had	 3.3266751498413933
abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all	 4.385795753535391
perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he would	 4.377680771621392
too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their	 5.876689602140937
she grew absolutely ashamed of herselfof neither darcy nor wickham	 2.941333476953369
mr darcy bowed	 3.112170553566545
she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information	 3.628435689438273
you are too hasty sir she cried you forget that i have made no	 3.205901323357227
kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with	 3.7425766741880673
certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that	 3.990967858058617
their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine	 3.5286858304710433
to yield readilyeasilyto the persuasion of a friend is no merit	 4.344510723413132
little eager to be alone and fearful of enquiries or hints from her	 4.2106672644722805
too full of lines under the words to be made public	 3.8446439506313257
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her	 4.233556706008941
politeness by the whole family mr bennet indeed said little but the	 3.59570581073106
for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was	 4.059076988359579
that is a question which mr darcy only can answer	 2.937112221728103
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by	 3.2157613294392053
in such awe of her intended soninlaw that she ventured not to speak	 5.451998878718354
improve himself by such an example as hers he might become a very	 4.621540470438904
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it	 4.205550697772097
when we do return it shall not be like other travellers without	 3.4251627964818634
house he was used to be free from them there his civility therefore	 3.2523954751385222
it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of	 3.2312158736827823
he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortable	 3.3143529889995333
their journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm and	 3.1953321144451987
character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had	 3.111481144299024
her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with	 4.196347376968685
the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she	 4.376135136171599
temper i ever met with i often tell my other girls they are nothing to	 3.0565240852154543
i nor any body can ever forget it is useless to talk of it	 3.8065209692572632
wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for	 3.5702644260777125
entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he	 3.9277501585423003
extreme they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap	 3.630683601258484
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you	 3.81520562222637
been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and	 4.09080888045621
all probability from the influence of their brothers admiration it was	 3.7653847658276294
and what am i to do on the occasionit seems an hopeless business	 3.4961118367898423
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour as for	 3.8139629707543334
the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a	 4.173056323035539
may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must deter	 3.820336722605583
us and wickham had constant admission to the house he was	 4.50356580202922
before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered	 3.9085671550133974

the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could	 4.790019834037584
impression i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such	 3.663574748371032
truth oh that i knew how it was	 3.63343205427789
to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my	 4.8100386186072885
assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be	 4.152640706932257
decease is all that you may ever be entitled to on that head	 4.091966065736655
towards him for herself she was humbled but she was proud of him	 4.4924174050663
it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to	 4.063118148939218
round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were	 4.430642449077109
that she talked as much as ever but her mind was so busily engaged	 4.028283579676558
miss de bourgh you both did as much as you could in planning the	 3.531220697650013
wanted in the farm mr bennet are not they	 4.89703740739562
good enough for him	 3.9623078954326183
have been a daily witness of and altogether i trust it does not appear	 4.6729355662846785
charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and	 3.477380403513594
it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to yours	 3.9370169216417397
forster say had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement	 3.4290706983705093
advantages in my power to offer you will find her manners beyond any	 3.4223820640566887

departure she observed	 3.144697488710003
contain herself as soon as jane had read mr gardiners hope of lydias	 3.7496131063064837
the evening and might now come to enquire particularly after her but	 3.288588157414102
oh but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a	 4.702132718735897
agreeably engaged i have been meditating on the very great pleasure	 4.94103038805222
been very sorry for any delay every thing however went on smoothly	 3.8577641688005744
but why all this secrecy why any fear of detection why must their	 3.1837224207512085
for an answer mrs bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was	 3.557945340884322
mrs bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine	 4.458332174304412
delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of	 5.044040174101597
sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a	 4.96786555012744
subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went	 3.8186766933552985
my mother would have had no objection but my father hates london	 3.495013799474871
began another marys powers were by no means fitted for such a display	 3.7617882565245724
if i said mr collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i	 3.60909868521276
we were all dancing together at netherfield	 3.4213543220281295
can never be what we once were to each other	 3.565341082033822
find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact	 4.002460077829109
circumstances which i am not at libertywhich it is not worth while to	 4.460372756715233
senight following which i can do without any inconvenience as	 3.822686650960071
mistaken light have given you uneasiness i did not think mrs	 3.6549346233928826
you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to	 3.2565113535355983
in a few minutes mrs bennet half opened the door and called out	 3.0740001883556465
family never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified	 3.531314455589677
i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully	 3.311202384926239
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton and the	 3.525333113840732
happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who	 5.055805969285263
an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth from this day you must	 3.3942518878589136
you shall hear thenbut prepare yourself for something very dreadful	 3.0433845125983816
believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates	 3.811226335882489
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister and	 3.6313601280437795
delight which words could but poorly express every sentence of	 3.2534536270451158
when first mr bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly	 4.825452587401484
aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused	 3.2483144089356006
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the	 3.312541895928274
boast and so fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to	 4.27145737348055
of it to another not to you	 3.746977456126299
countenance such an openness and gentleness in his manner	 4.409285836353346
that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with	 3.2932987512668013
nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the	 3.285813574262121
after they are married and above all things keep mr bennet from	 3.4223930463134913
elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for	 3.6293453765217687
feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once my	 3.4365590166434616
being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her	 3.911917113908229
that is very strange but i suppose you had no opportunity your mother	 3.8953625251889776
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the	 3.070136283180013
certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with	 3.3376098230772473
bennet and kitty though she was perfectly unknown to them even	 3.9668599562551066
marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite	 3.9167066373399866
disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man it might seem as if	 3.206597322262009
but not before they went to brighton	 3.6933195721779044
she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a	 4.2586715245684745
lady lucas her report was highly favourable sir william had been	 2.924374490291174
we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us said mrs	 3.3059619858489024
i am sure there is not on his i will answer for it he never cared	 3.389991800180455
gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth and	 3.8784995243030793
i ought what i dared to do but i knew noti was afraid of doing too	 3.720350029181686
elizabeth was forced to go	 3.001448560216235
some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course	 5.743257389920625
of perfect civility	 3.819393689598649
none at all we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but	 4.516232155560248
about the house in restless ecstacy calling for every ones	 4.174161813522853
there and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of	 4.197283220735581
steady gravity	 2.0712554686369473
last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice i	 4.3797809134862336
unhappy do not distress me by the idea i am not ashamed of having been	 3.878147089654141
approach and before she could strike into another path she was	 3.9098553947273293
you dare	 4.045326426091192
how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains i felt a	 3.5593355400673174
consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to	 4.213132726865039
miss bennets mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as	 5.096889005785014
all your sorrow and disgrace let me advise you then my dear sir	 3.770284750321915
the neighbourhood in general was beyond the collinses reach this	 4.588954996183341
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps he addressed	 4.285966621615146
in the evening soon after mr bennet withdrew to the library she saw	 4.121623881934965
if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who	 3.917146989434179
from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an	 3.7045390608294273
friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all you will	 4.659965225475738
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the	 3.48534879994739
them directly lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask him how	 3.374578915486226
her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind	 3.478654708830848
accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as i am	 3.7298445778652773
look into the park the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had	 3.6867046569136415
spirits there were periods of dejection it was reasonable however to	 5.1700615943889865
walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her	 4.797475378876535
enforced them earnestlybut however this remonstrance might have	 3.4028452716143724
more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that	 4.1210023294335745

a beautyi should as soon call her mother a wit but afterwards she	 3.3719684781468424
was so thoughtful	 3.6008350637451914
appears to do so much credit tobut he gave up every thing to be of use	 3.686876125655387
so cordial his countenance rather gained in austerity and he scarcely	 4.361090951408885
not rest till i knew the particulars let me thank you again and again	 2.9044445127592855
possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations	 3.2735767506950024
had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity	 3.598431741636244
you keep winking at me for what am i to do	 3.2166833364766436
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish self reproach she could find	 5.605665443346929
where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has	 3.50416905375651
with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance	 4.380219753810337
discover them but he had something to direct his search which was	 4.690512425617831
talk of having longbourn when your father is dead they look upon it	 3.3354015662867558
i never saw such a woman i never saw such capacity and taste and	 3.277336062366798
my friend as to mebut there were other causes of	 4.236055237019769
about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again	 2.6960491171521177
elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with	 3.6436928784019575
and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and	 3.4257678912836687
pride and obsequiousness selfimportance and humility	 3.758387816230674
slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of	 4.313132157491661
already there for the winter i wish i could hear that you my dearest	 3.689202530440729
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had	 3.420827415360992
though it was not put in as it ought to be it was only said lately	 4.08976575352179
could be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they	 3.550017268107436
mrs collins well	 3.465483405676655
one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where mr darcy then	 3.7130851222902423
that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon	 4.979657403970003
unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be	 3.2270007512503405
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health	 4.356771384941335
with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denying	 4.000996661689555
others and between her and mrs gardiner with occasional help from	 3.6655669086102227
that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for	 3.6441069349034563
and angry with herself for being so	 3.635772060639157
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours	 4.3777822540719935
you begin said she i can comprehend your going on charmingly when	 3.437197553187122
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would	 4.331234604671539
must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have	 3.894593482657214
away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said	 4.189619931961369
of them good for any thing take your choice but you must be satisfied	 3.61254724198062
goand at another word might stay a month	 3.1137514521449834
about a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject	 4.120145221965749
uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the	 4.668243530626514
been forming a new acquaintance	 3.5904665277294394
she be as tall as i am	 3.7718778727174906
project gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide	 3.121803360318625
she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in	 3.338562331299595
advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though	 3.5361577042305194
delighted with her mrs collins did i tell you of lady metcalfes	 3.3763734259536298
me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could	 3.8492340199632915
and truth in a few short sentences	 4.010161982838429
consideration nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving	 3.663115588392914
without fashion which is intolerable	 3.6135411230412378
this accounted to elizabeth for mr wickhams being among them	 3.676771478511855
the whole of the matter secondly she was very sure that mr collins	 4.629241477201978
as she pronounced these words mr darcy changed colour but the emotion	 4.118468570838467
walk and turning towards her these offences might have been	 3.112880010017644
oh dearyescertainlyi am sure lizzy will be very happyi am	 3.716608323686694
mr and mrs gardiners coming up they were all pressed to go into the	 3.6738280209223
such confusion	 3.9750636630943714
mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then	 3.310452784303005
humoured girl but as emptyheaded as himself had nothing to say that	 4.038606480327309
any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of	 4.133782184847125
herself with and one too who had probably been his own companion from	 3.2635370397807772
ideas that he was not a goodtempered man had been her firmest	 5.155368850423878
that there was much affection in the case	 3.7525407047861794
it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement	 3.735216699224672
it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been things	 3.937740987121647
the good news quickly spread through the house and with proportionate	 4.163455764899467
brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my fathers	 3.6193461903106594
happiness the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must	 4.181149337592
is my masterand very like him it was drawn at the same time as the	 4.142031032465262
family they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now	 3.708564329555684
i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be	 3.805523018834102
father began life in the profession which your uncle mr philips	 4.429085467523796
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said	 3.3714674003636556
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always	 3.9258269661927896
was elizabeths intimate friend	 3.612356840532431
swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance its banks	 3.306366836375703
was very obstinate i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real	 4.315139856269806
the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the	 3.9774230435017106
a novel	 2.5434320708877913
hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to be	 3.6607324991788377
whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is	 4.219634839806141
aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds	 3.9550904749121774
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them	 3.4620882499402716
as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment	 4.154175113094019
they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her mothers	 4.225949978575583
civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so	 3.529582523027863
we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire	 3.350607381069797
well then you need not be under any alarm i will take care of	 3.352738174479374
to be always so guarded and circumspect it is very often nothing but	 5.108055386169242
she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over	 3.984561732071182
them	 2.779467724834706
mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men	 4.141990132098954
were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them if youll believe	 3.6355933241438936
friendless and who was actually staying in his colonels family that i	 4.032030374417656
neighbourhoods larger i know we dine with four and twenty families	 3.183853828930684
mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command	 3.5326170530707968
jane had suffered and still continued to suffer he had ruined for a	 4.429250961612891
london georgianas reception of them was very civil but attended with	 4.720391681710507
mrs bennets schemes for this day were ineffectual bingley was every	 4.199694578846726
miss bennet there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness	 3.8588291393172205
stranger to the particulars of your youngest sisters infamous	 3.806206296075305
and of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy you have reduced	 4.482612078112055
to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows	 3.4898070694489327
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life and where	 4.204467716619235
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingleys designs on him	 4.050097551951072
enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her stay	 4.6595216447755865
scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every	 3.8673293877439883
assure you he informed me himself	 3.1413137448187216
expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence	 3.761768258457567
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment	 4.771306830856272
view of the house with weary ancles dirty stockings and a face	 5.999832690675204
four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge	 4.193279615666137
humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at	 3.826430534701554
desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of	 3.9906320798621606
across the parkevery park has its beauty and its prospects and	 3.046274028557794

one or the other again	 3.8091822099234722
commission purchased the reason why all this was to be done by him	 3.9962297185080526
i enquired after their brother of course he was well but so much	 3.655873277377029
against your will against your reason and even against your character	 3.1906362549202076
grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery	 4.850470157400721
the charge of her but i was overruled as i always am poor dear	 4.49578193689776
surprise his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of	 3.348142037580538
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer	 3.7570308010450595
were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it	 3.200816624560364
you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner	 3.3474978121573544
pleasedso happy such a charming manso handsome so talloh my	 3.5883825049877474
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and	 4.064108422226785
walk as they were superior to the broadfaced stuffy uncle philips	 5.246998217667241
the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for	 3.594240240461848
for the honour of seeing you here	 3.5932566464647713
the pianoforte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead	 3.848413491567373
well lizzy said mrs bennet one day what is your opinion now of	 3.7578319609631694
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him	 3.8796807807037403
either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object it	 3.332221879176333
be then he was very fond of them	 3.870864693486074
concealment this disguise was beneath meit is done however	 5.124427037941029
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers but	 4.3945110141891055
wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an	 3.1545572519595253
pray tell your sister that i long to see her	 3.0869018257339755
before any answer could arrive from mr collins or any congratulations	 3.9941853069559303
elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many	 3.963049710242998
understood from the gardiners that you had	 3.839293780039461
eldest daughter she must just mentionshe felt it incumbent on her	 3.66859068093266
gutenbergtm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the	 3.4041311037142403
you going much farther	 3.505976470375483
and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of	 3.292068712400894
an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it	 3.914005849739458
table what do you think it is excellent news capital news and about	 3.4482360598832784
this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors	 3.3373920824454477
and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the	 3.1920593967792175
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there you dare not	 4.520646088918238
lydia was exceedingly fond of him he was her dear wickham on every	 3.280183437639719
mrs bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of they	 5.060486835592062
would be at meryton again and when you have given your ball she	 3.4838075595176465
mr darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling	 3.173638916769355
and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever	 4.189568868455024
selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient adieu i	 4.522861737499796
uncomfortable of her life nor did he seem much more at ease when he	 3.2097393357834076
easy that every servant will cheat you and so generous that you will	 4.465746820363019
to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could	 4.458654499229633
but of this answer lydia heard not a word she seldom listened to any	 3.2729341471548095
often at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him	 4.095832119922624
quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr darcy	 3.8977530748020786
resentments of his having an unforgiving temper his disposition must	 3.303192872395756
so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed	 3.7846764133156867
nothing that she could say however had any influence her mother	 3.8872821840765965
you can but if i were you i would stand by the nephew he has	 4.266805150227092
what think you of books said he smiling	 2.8402147559437703
to town again therefore stay quietly at longbourn and depend on	 3.7466218236223665
in as short a time as mr collinss long speeches would allow every	 3.433822571571046
she did not like to go home again so soon she added	 3.4206509111695182
and mrs collinss happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her	 3.686644453494563
i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she your	 3.986906071732833
concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that	 3.43081559033013
dovedale or the peak	 2.827810895141625
their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing	 3.872172055907916
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female	 4.737353097448437
i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his	 4.183723353396242
from rosings at eight oclock in the morning and was as follows	 4.44051713798402
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in	 4.583480154204299
and looking and thinking for your approbation alone i roused and	 3.748613352054876
it is no such thing lydia does not leave me because she is married	 3.291955706062192
that is very true said elizabeth though it had not occurred to me	 3.4257443739979654
and anxious attention while she added	 3.5484373301243703
present reliefa glass of wineshall i get you oneyou are very	 4.9484037580643925
contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the	 4.164603773277508
generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told	 3.7731295510005127
as soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was	 4.512383066561857
living i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her	 4.100056146786564
treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner i do not know the	 4.054447347494707
know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his	 4.784391296204052
elizabeth had settled it that mr darcy would bring his sister to visit	 3.314597814716738
saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their	 3.661789662606461
her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently	 3.702076340363074
one of the gates into the ground	 4.033332317345063

acquainted by sir william lucass accidental information that	 3.921830415765164
the project gutenberg literary archive foundation is a non profit	 2.717381309338999
mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her	 5.290053476750607
madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some	 4.70158713932506
attribute in some measure to jealousy had the late mr darcy liked me	 3.9348054543171314
glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my	 4.062524997804011
but it is fortunate thought she that i have something to wish for	 3.677333637123263
placed in the gallery at pemberley put them next to your great uncle	 3.6216869464593526
had a very different story to hear	 3.8544905477630613
breakfastroom where mrs bennet was alone than she likewise began on	 3.4085695650654273
chapter xx	 1.9160620946979579
painful than elizabeths but whatever she felt she was desirous of	 4.089660012893158
freely i can recal nothing worse but the fact is that we are very	 3.4257024907091718
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some	 4.4035327318104365
friend	 3.612484540763268
utterly unknown to her before something he supposed might be attributed	 3.339642357465426
also more intelligible	 3.665402816181541
you have actually seen pemberley	 3.241230626923718
i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind your	 4.279095876923002
whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to	 3.090395326698237
demand it of your justice	 3.5218123336436538
between the sisters concerning bingley but elizabeth went to bed in	 3.7763455930850127
hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a	 4.609743653391735
live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our	 3.9866978540916844
at least it shews that she was serious in the object of her journey	 4.106714795405243
i have not already heard give me farther particulars what did colonel	 2.973123184255136
concerning either detection could not be in your power and	 4.136287671355367
lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey	 3.149999899778259
dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as	 3.327917732287542
softened by his manner of expressing himself	 2.9615232819427075
chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on	 3.1194209997719557
wonder and when at last mr collins allowed him time to speak replied	 3.256872444314849
was lady catherine books and a billiard table but gentlemen cannot be	 3.442878109344071
i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well	 3.0748313255296966
handsome she felt all the good luck of it the least agreeable	 4.1813806798936755
found wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in	 3.454437275025963
thing in his power to satisfy us on this head but on second thoughts	 3.2725200421527805
sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case	 3.846307203049574
and down the room in earnest meditation his brow contracted his air	 4.70504525918235
located in the united states we do not claim a right to prevent you from	 3.4077525500202386
you have a house in town i conclude	 3.2756622896791265
capable as any other womans of superior execution	 4.071606914303563
many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase	 3.701132250933418
we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure	 3.7045906876991643
transcribers note	 2.0712554686369473
offering his assistance as far as it would go but he found lydia	 3.4624466969033163
frequently recurring the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters	 4.4921534278489545
benefited he had some intention he added of studying the law	 3.3734433032069804
soon afterwards ordered her carriage upon this signal the youngest of	 3.466838418677477
refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my	 3.739166158551905
miss bingleys letter arrived and put an end to doubt the very first	 3.031133055860324
make a most important discovery	 3.2753498784741186
hope though you have but a short lease	 3.693726103569469
you on an affair of importance i understand that mr collins has made	 3.540129579315238
elizabeth but now as soon as they were alone together she said	 3.409664441772024
rather taller	 3.126753337675902
united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a	 3.8439439250775087
good deal the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are	 3.600308503911271
think it will be very tolerable besides it will not much signify what	 4.318342660358711
she answered him with cold civility he sat down for a few moments and	 3.457207351125497
there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those	 4.0355219375587765
make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was	 3.7758181719833406
necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she	 3.296547764895092
would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november	 3.3294055786517505
i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time i	 4.21720869167402
some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of	 5.648289144187323
domestic happiness were overthrown but mr bennet was not of a	 3.5287097822034506
mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has	 3.4810145618093085
day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he had brought	 4.076638264909021
mr bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided	 3.1532364682657845
comfort appeared very remarkable mr bennet could not have chosen	 4.268968337018377
minutes before the others appeared and he took the opportunity of	 3.546669697285952
well as of mr darcy his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned	 3.7364534714769926
only this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will	 3.9292536729576226
when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely	 3.2918502942828685
and this is your real opinion this is your final resolve very well i	 3.9505100437947025
do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right to be	 3.2076721907464565
himintimate as you are you must know how it is to be done	 3.6827646412417603
i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not	 3.496149562319538
of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that	 4.00146283133521
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for his	 3.8450443704892026
in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy she follows him to	 4.420975068042258
reserve and want of proper consideration that wickhams character	 2.8105041962062516
secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging	 3.240239350112205
jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and	 3.5425577440594984
examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her	 3.1506525763255437
heard it in silent indignation her heart was divided between concern	 3.7205525226627842

i learnt to my own family had his character been known this could not	 3.5061944218629573
your examination of mr darcy is over i presume said miss	 4.577921806712413
of which the time alone could be undecided from that moment i	 3.8967507082725867
connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy	 3.3901211409068623
mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while	 3.7498498353203695
when miss de bourgh comes in	 3.931705883098728
for her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certain	 4.156868360921358
could	 3.977885834781319
his reliance on mine made every thing easy i was obliged to confess	 3.3217317918089573
all	 3.5325904503434455
yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no	 3.4219874705917044
liability breach of warranty or breach of contract except those	 4.292799846030252
younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and	 3.469481759022012
this was a lucky idea of mine indeed said mrs bennet more than	 3.321062379665896
it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me your	 3.2039331024988535
aye that is just like your formality and discretion you thought the	 4.469214594608408
in return by sitting down to whist	 3.5050634185386365
remains with us	 3.2244927967965764
beyond a walk with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten	 3.9257786550215283
might in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbers	 3.3557071154172338
must marry a clergyman like you must marrychuse properly chuse a	 3.604884691977972
simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant	 3.3811233560167717
and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary	 3.795029196019918
1b project gutenberg is a registered trademark it may only be	 4.126403387038738
ah sir i do indeed it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you	 3.7498708866586763
glad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle the	 3.455614189906853
gutenbergtm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by	 4.104455292109334
circumstancesand he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me	 5.8037892760345136
lived not like the wild young men nowadays who think of nothing but	 3.8339324654103564
moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was	 4.079664477671906
mr bingley to her	 3.5604602381787687
a happier aspect the families who had been in town for the winter came	 4.266542105385129
her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist	 3.8673298410618155
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom	 3.614253389875516
attention when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling	 3.519491263947819
when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which	 4.619940900986067
pemberley	 3.7994876060429856
vol ii	 2.0712554686369473
comfort was that mr bingley must be down again in the summer	 3.446552041901751
george wickham who was his godson his kindness was therefore	 3.775710455220666
from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which	 3.3168434021131703
only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can	 3.7566204636792944
or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him	 4.504464062263133
one wears this summer after the shire have left meryton and they	 3.605900602696021
in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of	 3.2330163539363554
i wish i could say any thing to comfort you replied elizabeth but	 3.039467249518963
was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she	 3.3283380486233503
but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be	 3.5313758831189306
i am afraid mr darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper	 3.0875473484235925
enough to provoke him elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet was	 4.971980075614999
pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his	 3.533218257585463
restrain her astonishment from being visible never even in the company	 3.2384691124902654
and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made	 4.325698014046384
oddly	 1.919964484944678
what he was had i but explained some part of it onlysome part of what	 3.7216538679775377
prove what she felt	 3.9595320625564243

mr bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the	 3.5437791997840473
hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her	 3.8724834958332717

they were just returned from the library where such and such officers	 3.0022524757758338

concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being	 3.880945629520763
she had a sister married to a mr philips who had been a clerk to their	 4.113977894603337
post by themselves it is highly improper you must contrive to send	 3.582006150396836

for ever	 3.6663158540272227
first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the	 3.5168810631126473
to speak ill of a darcy but she is too much like her brothervery	 3.579313278148096
should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large	 3.3473517215860946
elizabeth began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood	 3.7242312998797744
mr collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had	 4.238733724993368

to find out the stand and number of the coach i do not know of any	 4.200436311933335

might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour	 3.2639432245029725
speculation i will leave him to himself	 3.5363376058937517
willingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation	 4.084568893286573
told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you	 4.18087273494743
dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were	 3.5564768965620837
like vingtun better than commerce but with respect to any other	 3.9408000453598633
was forced to come by herself and then what do you think we did we	 3.328937514586228
always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that	 3.919849261430833
why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that	 4.596284135081642
but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this	 3.776781617754535
bennet and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous	 5.014160913300912
her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present	 4.084074462812806
treated you too and then when we came away it was such fun i thought	 3.683395195063295
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her	 3.086541219793511
compressed marked up nonproprietary or proprietary form including any	 4.099953429058659
though we know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she	 3.3507831876068783
hope he will overlook it dear dear lizzy a house in town every thing	 3.5445343478893285
you must not blame my aunt lydias thoughtlessness first betrayed to	 3.2319948587076923
his mother as well as of hers while in their cradles we planned	 4.3554860415639896
perceive that her spirits were affected by it they were more disturbed	 3.3512130312943103
could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickhams name	 3.9370180547724996
mrs annesley is with her the others have been gone on to scarborough	 3.4064321330083627
the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured	 3.9031106231718824
person elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though	 3.307559247573889
loved her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the	 3.367651221928585
it ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many	 3.2679855552700294
generally is jane had been a week in town without either seeing or	 3.559075364361782
agitation gave more important intelligence it was to this effect	 3.7716127307416607

family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest	 3.5220649564515867
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickhams departure she found little	 3.794164653729486
every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give	 3.9629785162333584

elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself	 3.7995674915244133
reserved for solitary hours whenever she was alone she gave way to it	 3.1163921834120654
glad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming	 3.4595863656122194

she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from	 4.472410275566951
her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of	 4.50833990594064

the discussion of mr collinss offer was now nearly at an end and	 3.8960276449530924
that you certainly shall	 3.473493439526165

that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other	 3.718973685559064
his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade	 3.8142064550053068

of all the views which his garden or which the country or the kingdom	 3.913339980450763
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of	 3.608220159008121
but is there not danger of lady catherines disapprobation here my	 3.3458185925117565
but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that	 4.333173191940423
wait in the drawingroom and whose shyness as they had not seen her	 4.358398976543763
abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin	 2.88855667389866

entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of	 3.216988254441265
at night she opened her heart to jane though suspicion was very far	 3.8907165569349997
tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it	 3.3989876987365397

concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a	 3.8178668869688948
an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her	 4.070748927437037
confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary	 3.7274685637277156
and so was i	 3.418674696525328
dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away	 3.2855477506443993

in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have	 4.04163453688622
drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs bennets being quite	 3.937652631756034
but incredulous for mrs bennet with more perseverance than	 3.921753440879701
had reserved for them but jane was to go home with her and at	 4.296590961862087
just done to give pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a liking to the	 3.986698990834246

determined to make enquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible	 3.3314413135484044
elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness she had	 3.9533871862944836
enough to help anybody to coffee and then was enraged against herself	 4.921425798294604

came on to longbourn and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner	 4.991732708736329
absence from netherfield would prevent mr bingleys being there and as	 3.45895601450583
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and	 3.8648359789523306

you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way	 3.588083480772081
from mr collins and what can he have to say	 4.18535416436519
unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils	 3.488897985350784
neighbours in meryton	 3.678518965348385
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get	 3.2315128633874415
to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago i told him of	 3.5199073688463542
curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty	 3.460456107474946
she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses	 3.712785126624342
did not always love him so well as i do now but in such cases as these	 3.274006161042217
say nothing about it	 3.274412612097578

jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at	 3.227056954911317

tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses to buy them	 3.829042056133508
not such a simpleton could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy	 4.114264733034036
darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for	 4.543668421764987
she seems a very pleasant young woman said bingley	 3.386243800153266
possible she was more alive to the disgrace which the want of new	 4.5701044815509295

little uneasya little fearful of my sisters happiness with him in	 4.2330527438242465
and when mary had finished her second song said aloud	 3.5760829242296843
soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet it came	 4.390730451603841
which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without	 3.625984413119722

mrs gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found	 4.015498190671009

from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it	 4.217731686312828
at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never	 3.7919718979877173

fortune is this to be endured but it must not shall not be if you	 4.6737329700300165

so obstinate as usual other schemes too came into her head	 3.6972871965798486

by the author of sense and sensibility	 2.852380865321936
i am not now to learn replied mr collins with a formal wave of the	 3.5909397214791885
opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost his affection was	 3.3017582583905005
friends why could not he keep on quarrelling with you as his father	 3.53294804997065

but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be	 3.753311005283267
be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of	 4.094119805422076

of seeing mr darcythat mr darcy might leave the country but that	 3.9892107149300893
mr darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching	 3.227869546399671
left them capable of considering the last half hour with some	 3.221186932485023
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with	 3.525502350381683
that he crouded his cousins had more to say than he could well manage	 3.7072810823193345
discussed that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking mr	 3.7093344329812767

cause and not to any disrespect for her	 4.55497565229121
this was invitation enough	 3.1788908880740228
attempt to place him in an amiable light i am not equal to it wickham	 3.990155436437382
received any invitation thither for while there were visitors in the	 3.1574855169912057
as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution from	 4.469380156857763
what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself the	 3.1969355029745734
probably to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husbands	 4.6475789461284105
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its	 3.602768262688525
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy she had been unwilling to	 4.606497065771333
leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a	 3.602342515632092
i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out if	 3.5270193364257327
affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into	 4.310963264205018
better mr collins was eloquent in her praise the subject elevated him	 4.455451920115959
bingley what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself	 3.865587867248303
as sincere as her brothers in sending it four sides of paper were	 4.536396634882653
elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject	 3.6026654189887033
united volubility in lydias imagination a visit to brighton comprised	 3.605063799674051
of receipt of the work	 5.56445521098166
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of my mother means well	 3.3281096487926756
why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she	 3.607820387770766
the postscript of the last with trembling energythough lydia had	 4.132399216347917
present plan were to go no farther northward than derbyshire in that	 3.6232581367804024
real confidence could ever subsist between them again her	 3.7680913654283676
what is there of good to be expected said he taking the letter from	 3.2970042066913727
not as you represent it had she merely dined with him she might	 4.874853492443298
there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment	 3.4879593700045173
letter she had prepared her for such a step she had known it seems	 4.478126794572464
dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr darcys	 5.157681222099373
father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these	 3.335827736366815
intimation of her knowing her master	 3.2975237363974985
reserve to mrs collins and whatever might be his feelings towards her	 3.2734187626091256
beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point	 3.3997091981013914
and when immediately before my fathers death mr darcy gave him a	 3.8085471674937925
pardon me for interrupting you madam cried mr collins but if she	 3.286723619199472
end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way mr	 3.190757654412982
charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till	 4.375090588331078
one morning about a week after bingleys engagement with jane had been	 3.263304777378503
oh you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general	 4.066343737007127
and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least	 3.454644043169953
himself to have attained it the pause was to elizabeths feelings	 4.187351463792584
winter is over	 3.826322601808149
warranties of merchantability or fitness for any purpose	 3.6511837875258264
and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they	 4.198974269136349
persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not	 3.86981168625993
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but	 4.004487365555348
succeeded for a few moments it was first broken by mrs annesley a	 3.2932434330021496
acquaintance that are really accomplished	 3.407577472197803
how long has she been such a favouriteand pray when am i to wish you	 3.9980828216060806
behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of	 3.982597991409825
uncommon advantage the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a	 4.3417177708171355
wishing expecting my addresses	 4.200802331417742
time make their past imprudence forgotten	 4.090413148168138
elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was glad of	 3.906573033346411
without telling us that you were coming out	 3.80376936807715
while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether	 3.6225464477487894
with a stronger voice she soon added i have this comfort immediately	 3.3637576099339728
i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally	 4.057532010596757
consent there was still something to be wished for but the morrow	 3.4335247681320213
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business	 3.940838757856695
pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to	 3.236165438028189
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions	 3.991576319008684
mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation	 4.581406809650713
though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in	 4.500676336277067
greatest share the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had	 4.74896726888912
a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have	 3.2539294041082605
power to dance with others in vain did she entreat him to stand up with	 4.216152796737886
contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of	 4.137187729948809
elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after	 3.9138938211938124
be a very insufficient support therein i rather wished than	 3.777781175708111
mr darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and	 3.852196986545049
consequence to begin the acquaintancemr collins listened to her	 3.2735709013103045

presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt it was a painful but	 3.9056418734720055
despicable	 1.919964484944678
deserving her mothers reproach prevented his feeling any regret	 3.3450429525976797
indifference and brevity and the other said no more	 4.022343132480098
oh yesif one could but go to brighton but papa is so	 3.117556638470177
but jane could think with certainty on only one pointthat mr	 3.7876741723754273

door bell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its	 4.830932043851326

beyond my own party	 3.6094744739728655
next day	 3.319401234530022
lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer	 2.814996501787323
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared	 3.4246995432457905
that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i	 4.980842684064116

how i long to see her again i never met with anybody who delighted me	 2.9999945434725994
would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been	 3.3673665161907538

who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business	 3.700473469049208
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he	 4.181318284842656
has your governess left you	 3.640173671960056
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety	 4.234346981933447
had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as	 3.716775696403282
to whom i have related the affair they agree with me in	 3.4460346402251454
ever since he was four years old	 3.2799359301940316
a wife in view as he meant to chuse one of the daughters if he found	 3.78409902762179

he would not have danced half so much for gods sake say no more of	 3.8572564174428643
pleased his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of	 4.033634611229387

attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every	 4.0376458015021255
check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence	 3.264863072557756
had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been	 4.320668437559012
seen him so pleasant as this morning	 3.7137376388539907
it at all advisable after sitting a little while with jane on miss	 4.039414259802122
for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter and his	 3.4612812218947724
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects but when they see	 3.9423363420325512
of the surrounding families that he is considered as the rightful	 4.093025426455132
booksoh noi am sure we never read the same or not with the same	 3.4255066566804224
maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern	 3.758882772075841
and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of	 3.955179166280333
and permanent future for project gutenbergtm and future generations	 2.890889909779645
together there is no end of it well i was so frightened i did not	 4.285917276762516
upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get	 3.0714039429839053
resume his book but mr collins after assuring them that he bore his	 3.703841794458499
you are very kind sir i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may	 3.0823219297038382
not think any thing less than two courses could be good enough for a	 3.4877181228335794
victory over him continued her triumph	 3.3967381607552456
from what we have seen of him continued mrs gardiner i really	 3.3316398396922398
bingley vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her	 3.3254310524362913
would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her	 3.9624832451727934
shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to	 4.178004408843854
what he said of mr darcys indifference and she could do nothing but	 3.245913298904035
they returned down stairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were	 3.4516136225163194
our own vanity that deceives us women fancy admiration means more than	 3.099051108122715
chapter x	 1.9160620946979579
comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday she was	 4.098728014417682
done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlottes	 4.4331128826424315
at least highly interesting the power of doing any thing with	 3.0471851506815972
lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public	 3.81059918362226
dont keep coughing so kitty for heavens sake have a little	 3.6956560416885678
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the	 3.7295769749628
is sadly grieved my father bears it better how thankful am i	 3.4921086664585004
the compliment you are paying me i am very sensible of the honour of	 4.005772520402124
confusion and unable to lift up her eyes had miss bingley known what	 3.2822076782747467
what her anxiety for his life had been before	 3.5131674965905173
dishonesty i must call it	 3.673635484043597
prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so	 2.993853100439503
i must ask whether you were surprised said elizabeth	 3.125552794297713
take us all there for the summer it would be such a delicious scheme	 4.497827070866851
had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his	 3.271438911694231
intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a	 3.284067498854622
never be successful and general disappointment is only warded off by	 3.5595100501828942
to admire the view mr collins attending them to point out its	 3.7952154417345283
sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane	 3.572209713374277
full of both i know you will do him such ample justice that i am	 3.7797632597495205
enquiries which she very early received from mr bingley by a housemaid	 3.549880587142585
forster i thought i should have died and that made the men suspect	 3.77431402768952
tell you all	 3.51606460047498
but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort	 3.2143515445710173
nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side	 3.279930430636749
drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much	 3.301251839253445
arranging miss de bourghs footstool that she said mr collins you	 4.907395558250143
when he first came into the room in no countenance was attentive	 3.1553593862160088
her eyes envied every one to whom he spoke had scarcely patience	 3.445408966924683

either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from	 3.6705638058893797
such an enormity at so early an age howsoever that may be you	 3.4604786850199583
only of you	 3.8108647797244397
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence	 3.7294783709384
favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a	 3.387264825512049

repugnancecauses which though still existing and existing to	 4.166892816452057
appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting	 3.629649870195061
moment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly	 3.416823199918809
husbands what a pity it is mamma we did not all go	 4.894262702717307
are you thinking are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted	 3.9800850543917075
something for fortune and figure	 3.4097303356685855
indifferent because i wished iti believed it on impartial	 3.4640560989606235
yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine	 3.7034532934663025
perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page she	 3.613788952464846
even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave	 3.281776714497909
the delight of mrs bennet and the mortification of kitty are scarcely	 4.422097089730841

they found mary as usual deep in the study of thorough bass and human	 3.5583757680940735
hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the	 3.8615971943622287
know	 3.33571511389783
no really replied elizabeth i think there cannot be too little said	 3.626189205800787
disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate there	 3.957596760712871
extreme and continually was she repeating why is he so altered from	 3.2526664234661404
short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard	 3.446397508462361
gentlemens appearing her colour increased yet she received them with	 3.1035102680354236
falsehood	 1.919964484944678
mr bingley does not know mr wickham himself	 3.633482444845791
merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he	 3.756800265480247
it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose	 2.993119867795799
all intercourse was at an end but at length by elizabeths persuasion	 3.5994160872325365
urgent business calls us home immediately conceal the unhappy truth as	 3.0266787322625284
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday his	 4.432558235859656
he should stand his ground yet he had avoided the netherfield ball	 3.796848931362144
bring no proof of its injustice she had never heard of him before his	 5.157763014065277
she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley	 3.966969477028525
him think really ill of her	 3.4078111117268137
was repeated to colonel f who instantly taking the alarm set off	 3.1443632759857163
short pause followed this speech and mrs hurst began again	 3.4948792467753758
she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real	 3.807295539796971
scarcely less eager to meet her again i really do not think georgiana	 3.708670999492794
elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how	 4.4318481434100985
share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a	 4.735322184878351
catherines condescension as he knew not how to admire enough	 4.074249810322151
been well looked after i always thought they were very unfit to have	 3.62330335354807
laugh	 4.058361762341074
the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux	 3.940298820245319
gratitudefor to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such	 4.56348907376496
and that said mrs reynolds pointing to another of the miniatures	 4.634393157225077
their party in the diningroom was large for almost all the lucases	 3.9208843198485064
would rather have cried her father had most cruelly mortified her by	 4.4084700476641085
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very	 3.862839011456373
was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and	 3.840797072802262
yes very handsome	 3.2816928024053262
length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield	 3.5696182429591956
and that is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his	 3.6388368375412443
what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of every thing	 4.234815441550371
the house	 2.871454832750351
see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four	 3.303151289300738
but only because her husbands regiment happens to be so far off if	 4.260916905768125
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent	 5.394695125142489
before had been almost an angel of light he was declared to be in debt	 3.7235701343198127
marry and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but	 3.451602058258694
while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehensions of	 4.355438851037292
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with	 3.0539373084541017
himself	 3.0106300027651467
you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first	 3.3750231874111534
then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of	 3.2389726166119392
then getting up walked about the room elizabeth was surprised but said	 3.3818834449505886
that sum	 2.8456745320581947
again he enquired in a friendly though general way after her family	 4.237507352112189
yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot come	 3.084681365275033
married i shall have nothing to wish for	 3.8408300904665102
and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy	 4.842996468067659
you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of	 3.899774722325193
and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice oh lydia	 3.769429871960771
the first grand object of every mornings impatience through letters	 4.046705916396782
oh said she i heard you before but i could not immediately	 3.994418797424738
let the other young ladies have time to exhibit	 3.775542453332959
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him in	 4.304192830078158
be your man he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably	 4.018250100461852
she urged jane to borrow mr bingleys carriage immediately and at	 3.974041214079752
joy	 4.902262443131074
fathers behaviour as a husband she had always seen it with pain but	 3.619580294294029
with a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing	 3.829567929819984
her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her	 4.208757504917405
yes and i had heard it before but what is that to me if there is no	 3.6571345286666506
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn and the two	 4.295115995701985
says happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over	 3.4092478888102384
mr bingleys will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must	 3.4194227683329474
no governess how was that possible five daughters brought up at home	 3.014884001953353

for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes but the case is	 3.6772228349843283

where they may each have a character to preserve they will both be	 3.1695233168950256
ourselves intentionally injured we must not expect a lively young man	 3.455202471545083
immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving	 3.9611275467988216
in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with her	 3.106032100791372

jane looked at her doubtingly oh lizzy it cannot be i know how much	 3.7977808729125555

immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour but	 3.8857062474596926
it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen i was	 4.272210290903303
not comprise what i have to tell you i must confess myself	 3.669462680047355
fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they	 4.308168168394478
opened his lips the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was	 4.103851043771299
many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few	 3.5457870934155955
or any other work associated in any way with the phrase project	 3.4897916246807994
mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth so near	 3.332611113377119
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour	 3.6441587921187737
engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of	 2.8017989433370354
to the late mr darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the	 3.56275686603276
and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage	 3.8287935606587755
can you come tomorrow	 3.3295403569205777
colonel fitzwilliam he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man he	 3.2266961551371733

having passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his first	 4.0035450379036
with the housekeepers room	 3.963233457696617
wickhams alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated	 3.444415922537138
that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth	 3.3539859538482415
next saturday	 3.922001443467403

told me all about it	 3.5082884662914107
king and the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth with jane	 3.306120180749805
to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account i often	 3.613966353754997
standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and	 4.375958230748268
shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight	 3.85691678604061
she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it	 3.8573866984248935
recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of	 4.514014788115835
this was not very consoling to mrs bennet and therefore instead of	 4.188799451037375
must own that she was tired of great houses after going over so many	 3.897855373352645
a little seabathing would set me up for ever	 3.297076679085489
i do not know mrs bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to	 3.394273642480933
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly kitty and lydia take	 3.5597709157941217
which was my chief inducement to enter the shire i knew it to be a	 3.999908501307003
hurry and confusion of the following hour had elizabeth been at leisure	 3.56990882313468
pemberley from her might be mischievously construed her colour	 4.951818363564931
the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made	 3.183514085440912
done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and	 3.878698365682291
all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs	 2.8320680990693194
relieved by discerning such different feelings	 3.3224152833172966
laugh mr darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can	 4.4336873159385615
but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said jane	 3.4255928311915502
feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been	 3.370148306557969
miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards got up and walked about	 3.1848298058143696
commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the	 3.0848885224524736
liberally bestowed my father supported him at school and	 3.5323239643499513

carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably	 3.761564974624175
pride and prejudice	 2.4649914291132085
what could become of mr bingley and jane was a wonder which	 3.9086701165568973
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and every body was	 4.564605933261951
be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most	 4.264448700210995
and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would	 4.095306487915577
sure it will be too much for kitty wont it kitty	 3.9871135268268234
mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large	 4.526921780872981
his commission so much the better it will save me a world of trouble	 3.5852553525258655
was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or	 3.36663710914432

people could be meant than those with whom she was connected there	 3.249909768224522
coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of every	 4.212234241739073
and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear	 3.375605853926724
propriety not a pleasure to himself he seldom appeared really	 3.3428333128563517
1d the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern	 4.748558004869329
report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to	 3.5410123698235565
among his intimate acquaintance with them he is remarkably	 3.6258313141014846
interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with	 3.3011416515679484
him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and	 3.8957711405327844
minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion she	 3.9709328056915427
beauty entirely behind he could number the fields in every direction	 5.327396251786902
again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to	 3.8842370714937737
struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing and called out to	 4.237948013669225
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience	 3.709183706338918
them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and	 4.716867528654233
you all to come here as soon as possible i know my dear uncle and	 3.8350571472939947
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of	 4.0957398941133025
the park was very large and contained great variety of ground they	 3.3758458057223173
i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short	 3.7478980242732773
delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of	 3.424256412782293
work my daughters are brought up differently but every body is to	 3.394784548595117
to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect	 3.73866096484347
other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone	 3.945088995577225
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own	 3.992948549544417
yes vanity is a weakness indeed but pridewhere there is a real	 4.516955438345733
be seen the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable	 4.150567709194036
the whole party in the liveliest spirits	 4.137182717659088
for it however mr wickhams happiness and her own was per force	 3.5184565625971893
mrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no	 3.6748378642493527
again and you will find me as good as my word i have no pleasure in	 3.9820547790462197
the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a	 5.055391805558655

for her to know in what manner she acceded to it she immediately felt	 4.188978058133746
was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded	 3.551807131864388
by himself if he had another motive i am sure it would never	 4.2867287696252

occupied in observing mr bingleys attentions to her sister elizabeth	 3.9599547346003394
lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me how little did you	 4.290308770853101
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give	 3.7372654261674936
consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner	 3.533587392249233

their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or	 3.6854380669240223
it was not known that wickham had a single relation with whom he kept	 3.7485301425594755

at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about	 3.5429501515275086
of which prudence forbad the disclosure she dared not relate the other	 4.885188439442197

not appear in the least affected by it he was always to have gone on	 3.7868259647097657
gentlemen did approach and when mr wickham walked into the room	 3.741073386754067
this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by	 3.940635962912698
nothing of that who should suffer but myself it has been my own doing	 3.471041843895728
to talk again of either but there was still something lurking behind	 3.563189194259451
disagreeable	 1.919964484944678
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from	 5.948596567307989

follypleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect	 3.6928868209841035
sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon	 3.839325058658842
have a right to such very strong local attachment you cannot have	 3.4744905552239507
are never of so much consequence to a father and if you will stay	 3.859180758538307

did he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant and since this sad	 3.9718412671575156
collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only	 3.3387501633224352
spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became	 3.2617743654819256
immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper	 4.893637818226596
naturally lively enough and we all know that wickham has every charm of	 3.680292448043878
so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear that	 3.693938789594736
people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance	 3.2121576146906445
up he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as	 5.476478420332117
and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for any one in	 4.141338455694558
being acceptable	 3.1426290131581864
handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the	 3.57075526732185
being at home again in a day or two jane was already so much recovered	 3.2036038269350615
lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingleys	 3.376485311685595
but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident	 3.4040500291678573
kingdom upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in my	 3.1007821280755414
accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without	 4.043794626124634

intention but mr darcy chose to doubt itor to treat it as a merely	 4.338001477704145
spirits oppressively high no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her	 5.0827456977440235
principal object he was then he said on his way to longbourn on	 3.656146221920835
as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to	 5.8140435803844595
town in the hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he	 4.611418510468387
most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he	 4.072910038396428
and how impossible in others	 3.1562254775358576
doubted and was silent this he considered sufficient encouragement	 3.3734605870460785
this half hour and master has had a letter	 3.223287182197877
childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest	 3.4562538697596126
nowhy should he if it was not allowable for him to gain my	 4.8657561803992095
being so addressed was very evident her cousin prefaced his speech with	 3.2562314199392848
amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no	 4.120316457573089
he is also handsome replied elizabeth which a young man ought	 3.304575547231708
passed off much better than she expected for mrs bennet luckily stood	 3.892926900571251
advantageous by you i was properly humbled i came to you without a	 4.825644189064307
morning they were therefore to goelizabeth was pleased though	 3.633047360801352

disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest	 4.013091111382125
table for him	 3.849251918158171
within the book any other inconsistencies with modern spellings have	 4.959100041307742
seemed likely the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might	 4.19372882713258
we have heard only once he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say	 4.3008256097267665
younger sisters out miss bennet	 3.2086297334714726
whom we shall deprive you	 3.753554996536853
refreshment but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely	 3.6285793110200055
such an evil	 3.7164850389745983
every body away from him and her daughter elizabeth who had a letter	 3.6929807397809333
very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so	 4.281477998050147
daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship	 3.741002325094954
she felt herself to be right	 3.4359780711452954
and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch i cannot be	 5.9151942465301754
e gardiner	 2.813677300159217
but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult	 3.1054530389361035
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but	 3.525493926976308
good luck they must all go to brighton that is the place to get	 3.5769114063359315
body especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment i cannot	 4.462853499608777
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment their parties	 3.292560770821804
know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear	 3.4324455768679334
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared	 3.502966287572014

have passed within ten miles of us colonel forster gives us reason	 3.236571836022135
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece	 3.6140500830820157
shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it his answer to this	 3.9267707912974448
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a	 3.8060953314113672
to oakham mount this morning it is a nice long walk and mr darcy has	 4.634214500828893
it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty	 3.9387840614255065
to shake off her gravity i am trying to make it out	 4.381675513864285
her husbands mr darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on	 3.4213813438486356
of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly	 4.348721269145738
displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter resignation to	 3.5596016812552884
were his manners she had never in the whole course of their	 3.618579168281284
ah you do not know what i suffer	 3.9270303011372554
meryton last night i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose	 3.6210794363191225
came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects	 3.1515740596006734
you have insulted me in every possible method i must beg to return to	 4.3582654254056274
and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge	 3.8295893826155223
that she had no disinclination for it	 3.9509842582821744
pleasantry her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in	 3.466326734253001
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed	 3.906951549760118
arrived from mrs gardiner which at once delayed its commencement and	 3.3801435728357494
repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their	 3.9156076996425453
observed	 3.8732919205141
her commendation though costing her some trouble could by no means	 3.3964315960158955
she shook her head i do not get on at all i hear such different	 3.9454062036460518
certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but	 3.824681860111069
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project	 3.3894409923691224
great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly	 4.237121467771777
to others as in his reproaches to myself after this period every	 4.555451833068027
for them the motive professed was his conviction of its being	 3.3776735999141714
jane and till the morrow their going was deferred miss bingley was	 3.4072296492318985
her performance was pleasing though by no means capital after a song	 3.425735129234053
similarity in the turn of our mindswe are each of an unsocial	 3.434929226011585
violence of my affection to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and	 3.414980899351206
no one made any reply she then yawned again threw aside her book and	 3.9908775670245245
astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the	 4.586681904097744
regiment to accompany her to brighton this invaluable friend was a	 4.60431789454455

the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth	 3.378553030397002
soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my	 3.712420977172066
she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might	 3.18785838612699

i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation replied	 3.0980238262832804
elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was	 3.694323829672502

there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular	 3.910979772449908

humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted	 3.5458038071127715
elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for	 3.5632215357677293
to every tradesman in the place and his intrigues all honoured with	 6.013801038488053
for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so	 4.467635210004289
mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal	 3.61079073710552

when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having	 3.3288155367230163
tranquillity	 1.919964484944678
confined for time my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer	 3.98443640039719

perfectly good but how came you to tell us that he was so	 3.829641164580061
the way home but there was not time for her even to mention his name as	 3.5982141925214703
elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on her briefly	 4.219321981938734
i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me	 3.166983316256167

however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together	 3.3733754944973664
i do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of	 3.6742367598191135

could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by	 4.180879055145943

i did not think you wouldand that being the case i cannot consider	 3.3059842587310704
cold was their manner whenever they did her mothers ungraciousness	 3.314722107829123
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when	 5.518114552953251
his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and	 3.6157473120129255
their father from a different quarter from mr collins which as jane	 3.5812733625685524
when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i	 3.5321261428181385
that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure that	 3.5016600583757613

at length however his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of	 3.7397617706361252
oh my dear father she cried come back and write immediately	 2.875322904539238
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had	 3.2877076593927446
themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the	 4.044763577879511
thinking there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of	 4.087318792428915
uncle and aunt she staid with them only long enough to hear their	 4.094302223899931
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an	 3.804175898120815
with it and was confident at last that she recollected having heard	 4.222219901891858

comprehends every virtue	 3.328939204771925
unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety was no part of her	 3.522844199063294
friendship and affection a regard for the requester would often make	 4.0153586925791664
perhaps we might be deceived	 3.5367958535260975
deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that	 3.703612524526144
but you will know it when i have told you what happened the very	 3.490825565258572
colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality	 3.964763986330965
are you not diverted	 3.382044624494182
to be mentioned in your hearing that is his notion of christian	 3.3205960441329725
match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too	 5.825755601242346
that	 3.3284243386163204
was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had	 4.170208146210555
had allowed her to apply i am confident that she would have performed	 4.752702722047835
thinking you will be so happily settled i have not a doubt of your	 4.061624495487586
i flatter myself that my present overtures of goodwill are highly	 4.794397445169733
turned to him and said	 3.599598387948227
frequently sent them it had always been evident to her that such an	 3.5830928557983053
i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they	 3.132222310454424
a favourable answer he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but his	 3.3647096716985985
therefore charged mr collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner	 3.778414086729766
invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he	 3.67221188031938
yes thought elizabeth that would be a delightful scheme indeed	 3.5042165353902885
the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard mr darcy	 3.9123534616456888
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield the visit	 3.710771142926392
considering the event shews some greatness of mind	 3.9413210244204597
a point should admit of doubt but really i know not what to say	 3.4120597193658937
lydiaelizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set	 3.023808609690448
their mother mr collinss letter had done away much of her illwill	 3.4989495047321073
me to unfold to any human being having said thus much i feel no	 3.7364064942013084
long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my	 3.658872375013872
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering	 4.396938348879331
her own uncle if he had not had a family of his own i and my children	 3.8925858718209865
eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twentyseven	 3.6200859337500515
them	 2.779467724834706
comfortably enough there were half hours of pleasant conversation with	 3.38547590443274
hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing	 4.597908175584301
added i shall insist on their giving one also i shall tell colonel	 3.6276890897747593
of that when they fall in love	 4.701591839764653
it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a	 3.9547770776473516
as it was the express was sent off to longbourn but our visitor	 3.3614164077849353
the happiest of men	 2.855959126590251
far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his	 3.3150361928009584
in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting	 3.0505657921355174
have been said and silence was very awkward she wanted to talk but	 3.7310705079668485
exceedingly fair lady lucas began directly to calculate with more	 4.076465919636361
lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a	 3.1474188603673805
mr bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his	 3.598869645861088
nothing to do elsewhere	 3.7697054102095846
affronted by their advice and lydia selfwilled and careless would	 4.797867249691412
himself while his wife seriously commended mr collins for having	 3.7779103553615774
darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his	 4.071556514356355
she when he knows who they are he takes them now for people of	 3.795108655554588
good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of	 4.856568708117216
way that would induce you to accept me	 4.247796778144265
spot mr denny addressed them directly and entreated permission to	 3.1267189199385634
your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you	 4.016556633340739
wickham you must be very happy it is a great comfort to have you	 4.579774986470415
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after	 3.7745499296506253
hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report for what do we	 4.1401278448245655
elizabeths sake he assisted him farther in his profession lydia was	 4.406978596845424
house but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the	 3.5790745994511997
to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his	 4.314280339790482
it is something to think of and gives her a sort of distinction among	 4.513485044926666
fear for her felicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct	 3.697737614230691
and he soon afterwards said aloud mr bennet have you no more lanes	 3.7240290507979985
at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and	 3.8821182244256707
selecting a wife as i certainly did	 3.444469211774975
increasing	 1.919964484944678
no indeed i do not wish to avoid the walk the distance is nothing	 3.66470336563598
of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this	 4.448409585958368
the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her	 3.199154238533262
very oddyet it did and even a third it seemed like wilful	 3.814726226686518
pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintance every day but	 3.7370753168413846
rid of her two most deserving daughters with what delighted pride she	 3.0948101336545575
husbands love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their	 3.7370214652246223
the children but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the	 4.28085455562156
the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to	 3.368200761071711
mother went forward to meet her but instead of the expected summons	 3.3084128045364944
other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it	 4.357791116880296
as i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who marries	 3.7344269462126682
your uncle has laid down to bring it about and the other how i am	 3.624296087784227
with the rest of the party she now lost every expectation of pleasure	 3.212328884640448
which soon brought to her recollection that mr darcys explanation	 3.4063323323834904
wonder nor condemn but the belief of his selfconquest brought nothing	 4.682049923759107
thing that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter his	 4.442957882490107
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by	 4.933387104934688
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared	 3.422167725717788
library to write and the girls walked into the breakfastroom	 3.4469119533003933
presumption and besides no traces of them were to be found on the	 4.221255808644885
the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the	 3.3904276449302007
stiffness of manner and resentful silence he scarcely ever spoke to	 3.129443185341215
her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal	 4.134458188575108
days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to	 3.9761283710998208
well thensupposing them to be in london they may be there though	 3.899437075633074
sister must bring them more frequently together and her neighbours at	 3.814550236724294

the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison	 3.6235332031795067
interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those	 4.2222491978925385
so long in one attitude	 3.861229205302186
been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the	 4.402709284713265
insufferable let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied	 3.4989059129273725

and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying	 3.4143358489704916
of repose should not be broken in on my aunt philips came to longbourn	 3.955978709862274
the very next week she remembered also that till the netherfield	 3.1801769013516226

wish he had danced with eliza	 3.5351412949007934

expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be	 3.29491056954598
lady catherine i have nothing farther to say you know my sentiments	 3.358882204835295

surprised to find that he meditated a quick return mrs bennet wished	 3.751829759959674
her authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any	 4.62063093637696
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to	 4.749959804801881
who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the	 3.6180320991091253
darcys opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and	 4.442533310747422
the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particular	 3.3485093642670143

on one side of your lawn i should be glad to take a turn in it if you	 4.3247720685226385

that he was asking some odd unconnected questionsabout her pleasure in	 4.748417575604453

resentfully since we are not to visit	 4.0681724929150915
conversation with colonel forster	 3.340704056682888

perfectly ignorant of what had happened they went to the library	 3.804077719475045
casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr darcy	 3.638195265690701

mrs reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy drawn	 3.758454994866649

anxious parade walk up to her mothers right hand and hear her say to	 3.602496403760168
she was still full of indignation but when she considered how unjustly	 3.606718670253292
acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her	 3.761777067433524
of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate	 4.400257056344844
sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the	 3.2596472473801525
confirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of what	 4.2127664804867955
of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as	 3.3761907655083823
only think of its being three months she cried since i went away	 3.4921358384712295
would be we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place for	 3.0566795374749987
saying your opinion of him is sunk we must not be so ready to fancy	 3.8246020435379844
but that is nothing to us you know sister we agreed long ago never to	 3.0376167603890307
me but of course she did not mention my name to you	 3.7203217299236706
marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and had	 4.388649607423648
spot	 1.919964484944678
by mrs collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter	 3.1642566668640058
her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and	 3.6587637805092137
without a governessi never heard of such a thing your mother must	 4.020249515398787

mr darcythat to be in the same room the same party with him for so	 4.672643140896401
the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that	 3.6329223459464353
foolish	 1.919964484944678
one time left by themselves for half an hour he adhered most	 3.1327815228928406
months of having another daughter married to mr collins she thought	 3.6534184960852736
happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not	 3.7477986071463603
daughters as janes marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of	 3.4577664117873836
among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the	 3.8592713192999573
those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the	 4.662219064794005
engagement and dancing with him tonight tell him i hope he will	 3.6904704037715303
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined with amazement did	 4.618446357138561
not yet learnt to condemn themwith respect to that other more	 3.836239093821267
her stay as they had been at first the very last evening was spent	 3.888334180301942
the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly on	 3.930189061236151
of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss	 3.229099753031115
could only tell her nieces what they already knew that mr denny had	 3.423705829434475
as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance but though	 5.154440769822301
father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their	 3.499693342048177
restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the	 3.865034178780273
so very guarded if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill	 4.2059473352079895
certainly not at first but they are very pleasing women when you	 3.514116494868974
instance fame had fallen short of the truth and added that he did	 4.114169489306459
resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her	 4.605497334319617
to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to	 3.2491523264159565
should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever	 3.1361201588380445
last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a	 3.467557239048054
determined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets	 3.44281313588131
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path this idea	 3.8062448360635814
produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable	 3.59483994661578
evening after tea mr bennet retired to the library as was his	 4.410303217239945
not long as caroline and mrs hurst were going out i dare say i shall	 3.3910277943473157
poor lydias situation must at best be bad enough but that it was no	 3.603596124884089
when the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to elizabeth	 3.773053157684005
but circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging	 3.734928356507825
consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no	 5.189529299250533
meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that	 4.214837228256551
your daughter but would my giving you the wishedfor promise make	 3.4225228618954464
unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful	 3.6730906473137996
acquaintance are connected wickham passed all his youth there you	 3.729152108524867
darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence	 3.3415643564079467
how i should like to be married before any of you and then i would	 4.008891309209923
subject you may depend upon my seeking no further	 3.714267437704318
address him on his weakest side with his notions of dignity he would	 5.442515999129255
intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea	 3.8760872421921797
determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy but	 4.6590405736359
my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express themby which	 4.528167307363135
favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest	 3.386875469424036
lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to	 3.6010779145320924

he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam	 3.6797150396384604
elizabeths mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after	 5.037609123246011

sentimentif you have not been mistaken here i must have	 3.701124493678231
within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr gardiners	 3.098100508780846

oh lord yesthere is nothing in that i shall like it of all	 3.90894395390987
superior to his sister as well by nature as education the netherfield	 3.4942985592781364
he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each	 4.202495114709673
cannot be too soon forgotten and the effort which the formation	 5.183723676456536
viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and	 3.969127502917088
attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother	 4.423488085558335
petition rejected she assured him that no one intended to play and the	 3.3409104349728
the former faults of any person without knowing what their present	 3.790314194865869
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions	 3.3073172834228357
packed up good bye give my love to colonel forster i hope you	 3.339834956851256
who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her	 3.265002973835648

in which you have been brought up	 4.092272015360277
hereafter her own he had certainly formed such a plan and without	 3.159750770338335
female of the family mrs bennet chose to consider it as given in	 2.9584160293527373
she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell	 4.474273888659652
proved to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame	 5.666030758447333
for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose it is	 3.906250150632137
consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour it	 3.7358992033580893
she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the	 4.127172577977598
some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon	 3.1967724744775667
afterwards at cambridgemost important assistance as his own	 4.236982227814354

things you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us we	 4.376636794727634
you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after	 3.3697241873751342

in vain have i struggled it will not do my feelings will not be	 4.0467338511682405
mr bennets emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such	 3.463041476728715
between them and if she might judge from his complexion his mind was	 4.246009926720931
my frankness to believe me capable of that after abusing you so	 3.6689871864040096
in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and	 3.386351693744089

reflection and she sat in misery till mr darcy appeared again when	 3.1090214833862557
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the	 5.058355585110216
particularly begged him to do he merely added that he should not write	 4.280043209502771
by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by	 3.965023773224962

selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle as a	 3.945342353612344
which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailing she	 4.274923843622984
reverse there is a mixture of servility and selfimportance in his	 3.7068896757666043
they talked of his sister his friends his house his fruit of every	 3.9926714329351127
happiness no no let me shift for myself and perhaps if i have very	 3.8662055984732193
hundred a year but however do not speak to mr darcy about it	 3.4613915051266297
feelingly a younger son you know must be inured to selfdenial and	 3.961671519305009
lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy	 3.4140911356075856
at their acquaintance with spirit	 3.825599347885012

that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it	 4.631580900559619
how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions	 3.018688778691581
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love	 4.282295916906372

vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a	 4.650520648511893

anything so wholly unreasonable your ladyship wants mr darcy to marry	 3.7680215279513516
at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind	 3.6827707521311885

bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes	 4.204972227663887
this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure	 4.5729450042334365
how much civility on that ladys side the acquaintance would now be	 3.4164940740358967
discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that	 3.935375157023136
talking to any body people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints	 3.6545145100480463
to have on the morrow from these instructions they were summoned by the	 4.200735027138781
little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a	 3.7028110606405837
who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and	 3.280740203671238
bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of	 3.8579850345793485
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former	 4.439124787450388
of temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave	 3.2902368322565794
avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce he had	 4.721849842354336
elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said	 4.364370494969441
illwill for being justified in your advice to me last may which	 3.4293581950833345
told her to come to rosings every day and play on the pianoforte in	 4.0038330767198795
verdure of the early trees she was on the point of continuing her walk	 4.354755655133291
though it is difficult said jane to guess in what way he can mean	 4.440910430997792
thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you	 4.009499654866721
would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour	 3.4227502399442407
i am said he with a firm voice	 3.885266483854847
sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they	 3.642941083006319
a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no	 3.8356002304098316
her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for	 4.142332316995995
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour bingley	 4.499891103267495
how can you contrive to write so even	 3.860900385805807
or lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before she	 3.6194865705831214
and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings	 3.1638102333963096
their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to	 4.330201442034118
elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them an hasty kiss	 3.487239148799822
i cannot believe it why should they try to influence him they can	 3.299105031020715
for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he	 3.6809550660809625
particulars also of miss bingleys visit in gracechurchstreet and	 3.6621049034030047
aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose	 4.496367822308429
15th october	 2.0712554686369473
but allow that mr bingley when questioned by jane had long ago	 4.193387367645898
one point on which i want your advice i want to be told whether i	 3.425769068547023
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched	 4.878885180932633
do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place	 3.9252373689454765
sure that did seem as if he admired herindeed i rather believe he	 3.437288383599627

place and a camp upon the whole therefore she found what has been	 3.9232817221209664
them with pleasure before her answer therefore was not propitious at	 3.8879978111551057
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom	 3.9030318640999284
it had been missent elsewhere elizabeth was not surprised at it as	 4.020481733946779
the diningparlour for common use it was a better sized room and had a	 4.062061262733373
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from	 4.818892678210756
reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at	 3.3762763726762604
writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of	 3.990840041176887
your first position is false they may wish many things besides his	 3.329660060454722
impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few	 3.983880722189559
was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have	 3.294735514463131
chapter xxiii	 1.9160620946979579
finished it what a letter is this to be written at such a moment but	 3.405225232862348
was scarcely the work of a momenti cannot blame myself for	 4.088987480469697
i can easily believe it you thought me then devoid of every proper	 3.6998141421615913
goodnatured when children are goodnatured when they grow up and he	 3.8871182927319565
feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which	 4.448763258815198
elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any	 3.143250456664059
hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs bennets civilities	 3.9929846565986695
extinguished for him to see her without some dangerperhaps this	 3.6626484667050296
on each side with the utmost politeness mr darcy handed the ladies	 4.226037817286955
elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said	 4.1152683547196185
far as london for i am going there early in june for a week and as	 3.98015493108001
compliment must be all for herself her astonishment however was	 3.4926748535716468
well well said he do not make yourself unhappy if you are a good	 3.6020513245242953
relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different	 3.785967395614607

prohibited unless you stand up with one of your sisters and you are	 3.5277532198113946
the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so the	 3.8207554647839905
it was a fortnight since mrs bennet had been down stairs but on this	 3.4123389548620904
set out to meet him accidentally in the lane but little had she dared	 4.386960254023391
her anxiety had done no goodothers of the party were now applied to	 4.662923766555044
that w never intended to go there or to marry lydia at all which	 3.268856063639883
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject day after	 3.439969180956311
promised to write again very soon there was also a postscript to this	 3.5598871551592057
and of this place thought she i might have been mistress with	 3.8717288282902027
wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his	 4.247059190243468
the moment been led to make mr darcy acquainted with their fears for	 3.3283113584400867
about this report did she call to refuse her consent	 4.104055338421333
to mr darcy it was welcome intelligenceelizabeth had been at	 4.184482007765919

come here child cried her father as she appeared i have sent for	 3.1300065813481615
that will do extremely well child you have delighted us long enough	 2.988445639389308
pleasure to mrs bennet on the contrary she was as much disposed to	 5.120082554446361

the neighbourhood	 3.1342129029548262
two girls had the honour of assisting mrs jenkinson to make up her	 4.192816861527752
it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added	 3.24001370817895
there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if	 4.514838598524348
her ladyships asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at	 4.721881162984477
lydias infamy somewhat better it would have spared her she thought	 3.9011252435721238
my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly	 3.1759985557956103
time here and miss darcy is always down for the summer months	 3.5324897829716027
him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly	 3.7248103970787216
what can be the meaning of this said charlotte as soon as he was	 3.0619993351373966
enough each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their	 3.589381006063681
and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding	 3.7652182186078154
almost a week after the gentlemens arrival that they were honoured by	 4.0706080533615365
permission and without paying copyright royalties special rules	 3.847579565719737
did not expect such a compliment	 3.2488250316682987
gardiner but perhaps to the lakes	 3.4652365543834756
were not decidedly better bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters	 3.966385221370196
we never had any governess	 3.96165869197409
meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future	 5.5264103223046686
wickhams absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling	 3.6881116949114947
seeing him in unguarded moments which mr darcy could not have	 3.878618256394911
have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him	 3.5642765212289387
watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience	 3.5646301785710266
was impossible not to try for information mr darcy had been at her	 4.64476124108468
and how great you will be what pinmoney what jewels what carriages	 3.575607705254806
panegyric of compliment to yourselfand yet what is there so very	 3.2498093282099987
believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he	 4.111514114838671
are they indeed cried elizabeth with the greatest satisfaction	 3.9508548818497693
her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends	 4.238100857970281
	 3.59668628086706
dancing and his partner	 3.8028118639774973
event takes placewhich however as i have already said may not be	 4.5922765658597475
which he would have thought necessary	 3.8745962918967694
affection you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong and me most	 4.122406355527429
cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london well he is a	 3.7719044367283323
though mrs bennets sour looks and illnatured remarks might have been	 4.312909490347062
writer that could give her any comfort miss darcys praise occupied	 3.1533142646214265
often talk of it between themselves well if they can be easy with an	 3.3147743528538443
fitzwilliams words and these strong objections probably were her	 3.125039348536002
that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your	 3.893856739066893
to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in	 3.40260865594826
mrs reynoldss respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this	 3.7704556678758774

next to jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of course	 4.820114058656367
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry	 3.5803199281021256
very strenuously have opposed it you ought certainly to forgive them as	 4.50067267573576
with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all	 3.866705160945634
affair became public	 3.7217614779335864
particularly like your way of getting husbands	 3.673857778950844
way that maria thought herself obliged on her return to undo all the	 3.0941970162028367
accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master and	 4.400555001730223
money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve	 5.193481105642407
of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition	 3.4284366108474726
part of each was when the post was expected the arrival of letters was	 4.026524026172339
seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your	 3.58817991879004
attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i	 4.545558533518783
you already use to calculate your applicable taxes the fee is	 4.952983564319805
how could i ever think her like her nephew said she as she looked in	 3.2657731170861504
me and if you persist in indifference do not make me your	 4.070518990357039
much but he saw only the father the ladies were somewhat more	 3.205820617874708
i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation	 3.8344485443099794
be delighted with her she is all affability and condescension and i	 4.8821554072899955
would interfere what could he mean she was dying to know what could	 3.7875252716075467
from the time of year all field sports were over within doors there	 3.7503054655167865
it off and then i should have gone quite distracted and there was my	 4.191910776422497
person and address that can captivate a woman	 3.9667330859025354
than when they last met were plainly expressed she was disappointed	 3.4531288206429207
to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her	 3.7633152992065537
always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed	 4.394955131787905
the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost	 3.908593343943472

about it	 3.24099670704957
when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself as	 4.158920763969773

in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish	 4.120337143101522
miss bingley i think i have heard you say that you know them	 3.2472049166323482

lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue but mr	 4.322588170599137
yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especiallya	 3.815078123152204
could she think without feeling that she had been blind partial	 3.6382742815106193
it and could not help saying so	 3.7236477912383754
elizabeth took the letter from his writing table and they went up	 3.381052539688949
from her mothers apartment immediately met her	 3.6745644365943217
to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source	 3.996976828701047
before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness	 4.907128549861024
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin	 3.3122155966898252
before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling they	 4.233740324894716
him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the	 4.2363294185757985

impenetrably grave she looked at her father to entreat his	 4.143985868465332
very great ill usage and most painful regrets at his being what he is	 3.816456935505411
the idea of mr collins with all his solemn composure being run away	 3.816594875678537
officers names and connections their lodgings were not long a secret	 3.499393318947904
and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as	 3.0806300782181633
the little value he put on his own good qualities	 3.5836430084542936
trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so well	 3.8261951087017727
till he did it was useless to quarrel about him	 4.7702846564224
but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in	 3.0982675215976023
at length the parsonage was discernible the garden sloping to the road	 4.53751857777778
therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that	 3.9099693691143456
turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated	 4.039550221231416

that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away when first	 4.4682909122058465
nothingness and yet the selfimportance of all these peoplewhat would	 4.1728449989335505
sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth	 3.3861221363255836
forgotten	 1.919964484944678
him cannot have a proper way of thinking you shall not defend her	 3.643103664457831
but before they heard again from mr gardiner a letter arrived for	 3.3825004915758554
eight the express was sent off directly my dear lizzy they must	 3.1107967502506235

our dear bingley what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always	 3.7955813169124624
oh cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted but it is so	 4.297478904391307
her i would not have put up with it well my comfort is i am sure	 3.7126090128527673
with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure	 3.944577171125419
but she had no reason to fear mr and mrs gardiners curiosity it was	 3.566617590559563
her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of	 4.7243105517596655

philips first brought her the news well so much the better not that	 3.418016981933657

by introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she	 4.253269584028761
if he had had any compassion for me cried her husband impatiently	 3.361638699353487
down the dance so he enquired who she was and got introduced and	 3.4652138749354586
soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they	 3.3047094340082706

practically anything with public domain ebooks redistribution is	 3.9515475759067775

and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own	 3.6528238504913464
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology	 3.4163129121718097
ever witnessed in him your sister i also watchedher look and	 3.773482300824761

yes indeed cried mrs bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a	 3.535342927360572

his father miss bennet the late mr darcy was one of the best men	 4.039416736582816

like regard and esteem for our cousin	 4.309255611833669
that lay on the instrument how frequently mr darcys eyes were fixed	 3.7617796468803966

the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home	 4.3483008413788005
that morning should be mentioned and the request made	 3.48773993390821
elizabeths eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she	 3.6396279275579975
to marry her wickham will never marry a woman without some money he	 3.3627665795429205

wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks this	 3.4620999157287335
her turn was coming soon mrs bennet could not give her consent or	 3.293730042315885
whether all her sisters were at longbourn there was not much in the	 4.17036404237219
extraordinary for on first hearing it mrs bennet sat quite still and	 3.1337364230301454
tacit engagement with miss de bourgh are you lost to every feeling of	 3.572623323577498
house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally	 4.5811413874856655
recommend his suit	 2.587663339385118
williams allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his	 4.531196783984998
he was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that	 4.011229515119089
he would have been able to do something for him and his situation	 4.561749989036616
me if i have been very presuming or at least do not punish me so	 4.54122871195327
here she was interrupted again mr bennet protested against any	 5.03881275431446
disagreeable	 1.919964484944678
astonishand perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly	 3.534612595408549
you are then resolved to have him	 3.14080150403541
you and your family monday november 18th by four oclock and	 4.9681563607751125
only fond of this young mans society whose manners were always	 3.3077464120770244
to him with a most sincere regard and she parted from him convinced	 3.7252584143083034
as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile	 3.4487263677875086
disagreeable	 1.919964484944678
often does because there is an excuse for it one cannot wonder that so	 3.4578079386605647
then after a short silence he continued lizzy i bear you no	 3.300722314200348
this fine account of him whispered her aunt as they walked is not	 3.921301977885398

elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend he	 4.194573382423469
on quitting the militia	 2.883972562412051
the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after	 3.1740569031685926
gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her	 4.1752971844696605
have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his	 3.9293071177426433
meryton	 3.0919633026758175
stay i do not know how long his regiment is there for i suppose you	 3.692303588317619
every thing being settled between them mr darcys next step was	 3.1350306409914124
his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be	 3.7031891336213314
she was still dear to him perhaps he had been civil only because he	 3.3479344965855917
since we see every day that where there is affection young people are	 3.217559880693965
when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to	 3.105660533943582

what is it you mean	 3.2134529516536903
we will be down as soon as we can said jane but i dare say kitty is	 3.869275546460165
i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a design of	 3.149402565817625
very unexpectedfor your housekeeper she added informed us that	 3.142633757858065
mistaken on applying to see the place they were admitted into the	 4.51612160086044
of fun the other day at colonel forsters kitty and me were to spend	 3.7790056847759037
somebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid	 3.397465804612701
temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day when	 3.8679691812994115
fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply	 3.978153749940082
knowledge she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor any thing	 3.553018713271535
cousins conduct does not suit my feelings why was he to be the judge	 4.080872856038187
elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from	 3.1050778212101418
nothing can be done i know very well that nothing can be done how is	 2.9072840962430484
daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her	 4.800464723034551
little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them calling back	 4.667164396454457
was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either	 2.842406725062426
and much selfgratulation on the prospect of a connection between the	 4.244289216292594
rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success he	 3.4683729017847003
charlotte so very plainbut then she is our particular friend	 3.583458508450336
as they walked across the lawn towards the river elizabeth turned back	 4.488644837920747
but the gloom of lydias prospect was shortly cleared away for she	 4.396056195157579
was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their	 3.6698202034302025
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs bennets ill humour or ill	 3.740561960902222
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to	 3.501870088356808
conversation in which she had no sharelouisa you will not mind my	 4.587186481033655
he made no answer	 3.1631311722841016
i must trouble you once more for congratulations elizabeth will	 3.192840070574927
jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he	 4.0823229437376565
me how long you have loved him	 4.0363467122822865
charlottes observation and hurried her away to her room	 4.4478145105515265
bennets means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband	 4.084213297954888
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the	 3.6125601414855857
must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget	 3.533380097914544
her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the	 3.371781165968459
than yourself or jane at most you know pretty well i suppose	 3.1734975957282043
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention he	 3.2730024797416997
courteous	 1.919964484944678
and in their brothers manners there was something better than	 3.3002161112077073
in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of	 3.704621306019118
stronglymarked features which might once have been handsome her air	 3.1720176091722756

what has been done for the young people his debts are to be paid	 4.193005804057801
melancholy conviction of her husbands never intending to go there	 4.223163491185439
her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such	 4.021012256022915
but depend upon it mr collins she added that lizzy shall be	 3.261886417298709
probably notbut mr darcy can please where he chuses he does not	 3.9368409643190327
then it is as i always hoped cried jane they are married	 3.5496119529486965

after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every	 4.046302907547429
very thankful for his compliance but could not wait for his reason	 4.011661719329305
told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to	 3.9458922225392006
present mr darcys treatment of him she tried to remember something of	 3.9139630451633574
make him a very proper wife	 3.681984505891739
wellagainst staying longer however elizabeth was positively	 3.4652240427876713
tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which	 4.0599790167861975
the others with tolerable composure every thing was too recent for	 3.3662799311363454
nor i i am sure said miss bingley	 3.5337771880434894
she added very well if it must be so it must and gravely glancing	 3.6070586416398895
at all	 2.905222612888382
jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail	 4.240648032137103
called out	 3.6914958659787516
quarter of an hour	 3.6342055883719566
lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed out of	 3.156425766612517
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless mr darcy	 3.4801851965660906
bennet for many years after lydias birth had been certain that he	 3.8007269342454695
haste and come down this moment	 3.3551024929175437
over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried	 3.89012317929392
darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet	 3.077064142395369
consider how important every moment is in such a case	 3.7682223596417646
with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at	 4.078297998528802

returningthe part which i acted is now to be explainedhis	 4.07319095997352

pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock	 2.979431006373426
neighbours might all see mr bingley in consequence of it before they	 3.4175868502017845

morning he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could	 4.152820909332111
will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here	 4.71677800435502
written five days ago the beginning contained an account of all their	 3.3384914860462453
might not unreasonably have alarmed her she had dressed with more than	 5.130402390154917
aunt she rapturously cried what delight what felicity you give me	 3.2205918999430687
with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it	 3.5007323331040006
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence	 4.436115432052655
conceal from her his share in lydias marriage all was acknowledged	 3.0780370050130372
still something more to ask of the former my father is going to	 3.6356414637372847
yes maam all	 3.4128801113046885
letters always were looked over her and read it likewise it was as	 3.4747271089841067
good a grace as she could she was not the better pleased with his	 4.780302547028441
it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had	 4.093899321251529
are not worth a regret come let me see the list of the pitiful fellows	 3.4197352902623006
but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another	 3.7848000670615316
late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep and	 4.808085957946484
success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine	 3.8883287488092613
rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning there was a	 3.8001120866779443
acquaintance	 3.2583475709565732
particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged	 4.624651162391805
i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask me as well as lydia	 3.247583457450061
trademarkcopyright agreement if you do not agree to abide by all	 3.8481427954494376
determined he should know it and so i let down the side glass next to	 3.4356830335596897
lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat	 3.799075992426267
being able to give one accurate idea of any thing we will know where	 3.786613857019332
in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an	 3.2762673777488276
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be	 4.701139003531345
whether pemberley were not a very fine place what was the name of its	 3.448426825592001
recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling	 3.3725310531381143
was at a balland at this ball what do you think he did he danced	 4.003715275917018
acquaintance	 3.2583475709565732
taking different positions but from every window there were beauties to	 3.4906518043250885
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive	 3.210580415314872
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting	 3.7364076993580584
means unwilling to preside at his table nor was mrs hurst who had	 4.635799699558222
out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me	 4.122853706057615
to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and	 3.547233169191699
no no you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i	 3.052612874443213
how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the	 3.3442660562475375
of saying much her own thoughts were employing her she expected every	 3.903320489158158
down stairs herself on entering the drawingroom she found the whole	 3.5720206465145665
gentleman and ladys removing from one carriage into another might be	 4.4708327053378545
spent six weeks with great enjoyment and the pleasure of being with	 3.7691049736060327
pemberley mr darcy	 3.620198160736563
circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to	 3.5709656488710304
as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they	 5.246293354261512
two young men one has got all the goodness and the other all the	 4.023216985070228
looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful and	 4.092387235917435
may i ask but checking himself he added in a gayer tone is it in	 3.4204007247131556
they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me	 3.3353470541634174
character perfectly well here consequently was an inexhaustible subject	 3.3506474021737445
consequence of any reply mr collins might never make the offer and	 3.152138423280474
wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them	 3.205926141740667
entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side	 5.016713802680309
it with delight as they passed into other rooms these objects were	 3.6807202044829217
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a few	 3.606560621476751
communicativeness by his questions and remarks mrs reynolds either	 3.735083753213551
the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper	 4.222682090016711
but you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviour as	 4.406462333961245
research they may be modified and printed and given awayyou may do	 3.8144222906834977
awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage	 4.785665549695321
remembered to you and her motheryours c	 3.6865335505345325
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane	 3.5957833288669514
what is his name	 3.468392013687426
detained first by the civility of mr collins whose inquiries after	 3.6998422463208764
they should have opposed their brothers what sister would think	 3.555838684015672
much entailed as ever the lucases are very artful people indeed	 3.6708383603231547
service is over i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will	 3.474786377228963
nothing to live on mr darcy asked him why he had not married your	 3.6579791478927626
for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect	 3.97021517421831
with great energybut it is a subject which always makes a lady	 4.7868946949661755
set forth in the general terms of use part of this license apply to	 3.956270589103535
known she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her	 4.313222869229626
darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth	 3.194749400681129
it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way	 3.516157858196008
that is all settled	 2.9408425142970476
but youhow are you cried elizabeth you look pale how much you	 3.6798356702019914
mr darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other	 3.4474540415910613
the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good	 4.095716363708822
characteristic bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier	 3.2672285617942425
which had at length closed her eyes she could not yet recover from the	 4.356131965477204
give which a just sense of shame would not conceal with a strong	 3.5915452815717206
such a clue as that it might be of essential consequence at present we	 3.937731061165368
mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was	 3.138508457009475
was not unwelcome for its own sake the journey would moreover give her	 3.3090354668496262
trouble of saying as little as possible	 3.291054038345936
i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages	 2.95571442261765
enough from my thoughts	 3.6862080221706917
great pleasure in the power of choice i do not know any body who seems	 3.831163844147083
the country and of books and from these tastes had arisen his principal	 3.7143544269694515
continued with little intermission to the very day of lydias leaving	 4.677755775750115
may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr and	 3.9617973293955115
an hour after every body else was gone which gave them time to see how	 3.36055011967801
mr darcy with a very expressive smile elizabeth for the sake of	 3.8250656983174594
cannot escape the acquaintance now	 3.905330235665185
admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded	 3.9413305664285927
indeed mr bennet said she it is very hard to think that charlotte	 3.523827823232222
my seeing mr jonestherefore do not be alarmed if you should hear	 4.547611546399296
visit them	 3.613689901675418
uttered that did not relate to the game except when mrs jenkinson	 4.534004494012421

had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him	 3.1325890677344725
had received his commission before he left london and he was to join	 3.9277094372809254
delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits mr	 3.9477521332202663
over it immediately it had better have happened to you lizzy you	 3.5906186747562345
improvements it was receiving he was happily employed until the	 4.3543711246721175
most willingly	 3.1303169847740095
going away myself	 3.7216951171898534
elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to	 3.8761578862295276
one of the windows	 2.7734635764562996
in the kingdomprovided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the	 3.8384321909911154
houses he unfolded the matterto an audience not merely wondering	 4.877952842325408
decidedly for so young a personpray what is your age	 3.3110436584084226
every thing how i long to see her and to see dear wickham too but the	 3.0297312906534537
the badbelongs to you alone and so you like this mans sisters too	 3.740691429519892
take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the	 4.039207737199083
morning if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here again with	 3.8298160611834398
siryou will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching	 3.8433822442756154
i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had	 3.313174249204888
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park when	 3.3083284774235446
out of the room as they went down stairs together charlotte said	 3.361310284042555
from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two	 3.990572041373268
error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been	 3.367378299104258
your time unpleasantly	 3.8766402020789887
jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told that he	 4.0689046722081175

better that one only of the household and the one whom they could	 4.480135696043964
that could be so called the respect created by the conviction of his	 4.155322628747431
their engagements at rosings it was some days however before they	 3.16347973788071
dear maam do not goi beg you will not gomr collins must excuse	 4.225354001079857
they were joined by mr collins who entered with an air more stately	 3.184476194569309
especially to her friend	 3.71118429541436
good gracious cried maria after a few minutes silence it seems but	 3.159496083391128
that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her	 3.3781633760103924
her a very good sort of girl there can be no love in all this my	 3.6342755535260007
mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in	 3.6190917666266134
air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly	 5.163925493756629
as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in	 3.5086527774732668
time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice	 3.102459118295053
attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to	 3.603646304328905
soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be	 3.5223374798102993
eminent physicians this she would not hear of but she was not so	 4.188039303081152

at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted	 3.565329567873128
up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks	 4.209498147547794
friend you see by janes account was persuaded of his never intending	 3.2767414032383813

their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them mr wickham	 3.7354777259646195
mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise	 3.3918397363021846

in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped	 4.909463953763306
half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of	 3.473549481672478
janes temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope	 4.930609832685037

fairly conjectured from that though elizabeth who was by this time	 3.773867773639369
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody	 3.7933381787556724
already arisen repeated mr bennet what has she frightened away	 3.5613817054474235

out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all	 3.7279382683683635
from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was	 3.6434330889908413

project gutenbergtm ebooks are often created from several printed	 3.2331728547988807
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was	 4.599245097957157
a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece while these	 3.1982980248952324
experienced many hardships of that nature but in matters of greater	 4.629884352960339
and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though	 3.8110030383123856
body for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all	 3.5279759702818527

elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily	 3.5825562677162806

presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone while	 3.2108868635589913
i had no more idea of being married till i came back again though i	 3.4471357961322537

she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine after	 3.05288986338858

partiality when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my	 4.399479218924748
make herself uneasy	 3.383528708425783
some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn	 3.617004455517581
loud that any body might have heard us ten miles off	 3.273224895026733
as soon as ever mr bingley comes my dear said mrs bennet you	 3.3177554004614165
much more than to any other person in the room	 3.6055586444033425
he must be an oddity i think said she i cannot make him	 4.540399980843614
arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe	 4.165607237943324
doubly engaged on one hand collecting an account of the present	 3.127474257218213
flirtation and officers have been in her head she has been doing	 3.8112061022388324
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and	 3.448963387258326
with a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room on	 5.404105255445912
minute description which wickham could give and in bestowing her	 3.5495549452115607
dare say she is a very agreeable woman it is a pity that great ladies	 4.115778983364174
she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the	 3.5959886805121335
him she had hardly courage to speak	 3.54428132090681
the country	 3.2745094376739043
greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of	 4.040829653575801
now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and	 3.994172941882486
charities and charitable donations in all <NUMBER> states of the united	 3.211345571636647
with this agreement and any volunteers associated with the production	 3.648884196141496
elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at mr darcy was in such misery	 4.521961139803032
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingleys good	 5.659789635747014
which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the	 5.115669938981909
politeness then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute	 3.9550409451366524
doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was	 3.8954797078445145
assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an	 3.956172276231693
particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our	 4.438614054825135
did charlotte dine with you	 3.4145236413942675
her side but i pity her because she must feel that she has been	 4.054880138380287
exceedingly if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form	 4.041892037417117
concerns as i often see done	 3.619916831174957
that is all very proper and civil i am sure said mrs bennet and i	 3.7115443221210547
miss bennet i am shocked and astonished i expected to find a more	 3.399441752392844
other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me	 3.4139114115743947
wished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture a	 3.5077448615144546
nonsense	 1.919964484944678
called on us in this familiar way	 3.650001633519323
especially on lydias side but nothing to give him any alarm i am so	 3.253141543044326
collinses live very comfortable do they well well i only hope it	 3.3030659587566706
when i am in town it is pretty much the same they have each their	 2.9106958737061612
discredit and misery my child let me not have the grief of seeing	 3.991760638216622

done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any	 3.1760348723229868
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but	 3.5557691442164825
themselves the one missent must be first attended to it had been	 3.6346475368914195
bennet was not so well pleased with it lydias being settled in the	 3.585887419664956
of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as	 4.518904358619895
