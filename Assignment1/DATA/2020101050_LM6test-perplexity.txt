appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once	 133.28492824366901
revolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting	 12.232634256085602

originality, though producing its own reward, does not invariably	 98.14733559345751
conduce to success?	 11.017970152388628
His own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn	 54.95056244507385
by a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be	 555.1100387633304
seated engaged in writing.	 2282.399212405028
What suggested scene was then constructed by Stephen?	 177.69026702953687

What suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?	 231.3086988609692
The Queen’s Hotel, Ennis, county Clare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf	 563.3246682628464
Virag) died on the evening of the 27 June 1886, at some hour unstated,	 224.40197366545058
in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered	 12.590052724655312
in the form of a neuralgic liniment composed of 2 parts of aconite	 22.639411560885716
liniment to 1 of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at 10.20 a.m. on	 89.8311266525792
the morning of 27 June 1886 at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, 17	 121.96222984244861
Church street, Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of	 385.7106930318465
having, purchased at 3.15 p.m. on the afternoon of 27 June 1886 a new	 147.40680214303362
boater straw hat, extra smart (after having, though not in consequence	 269.1149616039459
of having, purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin	 39.74017880157454
aforesaid), at the general drapery store of James Cullen, 4 Main	 111.24073140001376
street, Ennis.	 122.98347171587235
Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or	 167.81255230296182
intuition?	 4.608171674364364
Coincidence.	 20564.82528810464
Did he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see?	 64.23459161217029
He preferred himself to see another’s face and listen to another’s	 52.41174609289763
words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament	 27.572284864410694
relieved.	 4.608171674364364
Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to	 338.1751631967252
him, described by the narrator as _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The	 28.041456007347634

It, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by	 79.34111177178363
implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms	 155.652033450393
(e.g. _My Favourite Hero_ or _Procrastination is the Thief of Time_)	 98.5648301887698
composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in	 71.0631727054388
conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of	 53.39778591487045
financial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially	 74.14289889910478

achievement, during the increasingly longer nights gradually following	 235.3105803473213

Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other	 77.12808751009167
frequently engaged his mind?	 958.33917078126
What to do with our wives.	 382.88184681331205
What had been his hypothetical singular solutions?	 42.22448507258363
Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spilikins, cup and ball,	 307.6327169016763

respectability in the vicinity: courses of evening instruction	 18.247424416294635
specially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable.	 5.946773498921295
What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him	 71.61296489713546
in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?	 22.77417288184921
In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper	 105.65250205630926
with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and	 437.007694585621
Hebrew characters. She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals	 15.965758775545078
as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of	 57.055311509313626
a city in Canada, Quebec. She understood little of political	 151.8576383785295
complications, internal, or balance of power, external. In calculating	 122.43031976109623
the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid. After	 196.2021546385403
completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the	 10.282577251946126
implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to the	 7.421390664553468
corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall. Unusual	 23.48915396845077
polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by	 141.58818459611953
false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), _alias_	 173.08001974329082
(a mendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture).	 892.6287614211236
What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and	 122.4887670495075
such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?	 76.03859160154167
The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all	 64.05545303739865
balances, proved true by construction. The counterbalance of her	 25.43078399846744
proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by	 119.56041334792512
experiment.	 4.608171674364364
How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?	 244.96124081506457
Variously. By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a	 188.45371934410502
certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent	 74.16620618746295
knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other’s	 259.2556272756186
ignorant lapse.	 4.411654744205047
With what success had he attempted direct instruction?	 48.75982880786363
She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest	 879.0817145813271
comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty	 118.0635270535359
remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated	 88.14938631524457
with error.	 28.492587109789124
What system had proved more effective?	 708.266134407653
Indirect suggestion implicating selfinterest.	 4.045570071155129
Example?	 6109.352620258348
She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she	 1734.4897247026524
disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new	 711.1040291914593
hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat.	 1621.6240958699743
Accepting the analogy implied in his guest’s parable which examples of	 14.04920607058457
postexilic eminence did he adduce?	 22.082036574175596
Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides,	 291.8886899457977
author of _More Nebukim_ (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn	 20.501916498630933
of such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn)	 258.77278638219246
there arose none like Moses (Maimonides).	 279.2021470381547
What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth	 103.7656163185366
seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by	 335.9697075601227
Stephen?	 251.95865148121723
That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher,	 30.403923302857116
name uncertain.	 169.22635686393227
Were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a	 85.8443977401723
selected or rejected race mentioned?	 340.7750823005594
Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher),	 3.803232782964327
Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist).	 3.857285642109819
What fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish	 82.35191382138497
languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts	 26.951103517835527
by guest to host and by host to guest?	 8992.066465715137
By Stephen: _suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus suil go cuin_	 34.38065585198354
(walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).	 352.8682795888572
By Bloom: _Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m’baad l’zamatejch_ (thy temple	 132.53548878315138
amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).	 125.6942651828425
How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages	 40.419385359456115
made in substantiation of the oral comparison?	 20.13327605007103
By juxtaposition. On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior	 48.18717495836593
literary style, entituled _Sweets of Sin_ (produced by Bloom and so	 624.321761745473
manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of	 307.4648230451356
the table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish	 237.06460532510644
characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn	 118.56479538504921
wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence	 39.20034169462294
of mem) a substituted qoph, explaining their arithmetical values as	 15.224260159193268
ordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet 3, 1, 4, and 100.	 104.25352976463807
Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the	 289.67979631018954
extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?	 9.593607965582708
Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence	 63.453324351180875
and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.	 7.363856441762557
What points of contact existed between these languages and between the	 106.12843282077951
peoples who spoke them?	 233.01312777736706
The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and	 32.38262932523133
servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been	 152.81482757152995
taught on the plain of Shinar 242 years after the deluge in the	 73.6332154365645
seminary instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor	 6.4360882757299125
of Israel, and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland:	 34.39338167765304
their archaeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical,	 8.258504979758905
homiletic, toponomastic, historical and religious literatures	 4.8109286533626765

rites in ghetto (S. Mary’s Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve’s	 29.797073428370858
tavern): the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and	 17.725212288993188
jewish dress acts: the restoration in Chanah David of Zion and the	 32.28096084014986
possibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution.	 18.825070293092185
What anthem did Bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple,	 50.16832911876456
ethnically irreducible consummation?	 4.206040932916629
Kolod balejwaw pnimah	 4.206040932916629
Nefesch, jehudi, homijah.	 4.206040932916629
Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?	 33.97677604718106
In consequence of defective mnemotechnic.	 13.006075349701725
How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency?	 48.694136979130455
By a periphrastic version of the general text.	 19.785875719842906
In what common study did their mutual reflections merge?	 5482.930399596322
The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic	 20.73575359403749
hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of	 34.657393650530025
modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions	 14.735850199118227
(Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic).	 14.73850958415987
Did the guest comply with his host’s request?	 280.48940327184096
Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.	 83.95454397838036
What was Stephen’s auditive sensation?	 148.19007029632792
He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation	 42.57166940194449
of the past.	 61.326205060539614
What was Bloom’s visual sensation?	 110.19941428155784

future.	 140070.91217506552
What were Stephen’s and Bloom’s quasisimultaneous volitional	 737.0906244472567
quasisensations of concealed identities?	 5.677790710659981
Visually, Stephen’s: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by	 46.02478519548852
Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as	 7.503897855786877
leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair.	 19.57492883808871

Trinity college, Dr Alexander J. Dowie. At the bar, English or Irish:	 846.4942917589328
exemplars, Seymour Bushe, K. C., Rufus Isaacs, K. C. On the stage,	 124.83430853239307
modern or Shakespearean: exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian,	 216.854531788817
Osmond Tearle († 1901), exponent of Shakespeare.	 35.140113595099685
Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a	 68.93996001354509
strange legend on an allied theme?	 53.711388781705
Reassuringly, their place, where none could hear them talk, being	 755.6513214906226
secluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid	 7.8906687014315855
residual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream	 51.48671715105819
plus cocoa, having been consumed.	 19.513172133325956
Recite the first (major) part of this chanted legend.	 149.89154910906655
Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all	 910.625287922577
Went out for to play ball.	 1026.5589402816724
And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played	 2145.3942830201845
He drove it o’er the jew’s garden wall.	 707.6495682379068
And the very second ball little Harry Hughes played	 2035.5279927597276
He broke the jew’s windows all.	 87.96243727970808
[Illustration]	 4.608171674364364
How did the son of Rudolph receive this first part?	 2698.33639606157
With unmixed feeling. Smiling, a jew, he heard with pleasure and saw	 197.47880398437962
the unbroken kitchen window.	 103.52093391423483
Recite the second part (minor) of the legend.	 33.68086988509016
Then out there came the jew’s daughter	 137.05756640038786
And she all dressed in green.	 198.90693542289065
“Come back, come back, you pretty little boy,	 376.9468510978789
And play your ball again.”	 369.60405739671097
I can’t come back and I won’t come back	 108.02586613145947
Without my schoolfellows all.	 223.58033280943457
For if my master he did hear	 535.7206303991992
He’d make it a sorry ball.”	 413.36905095175325
She took him by the lilywhite hand	 55.729044864332735
And led him along the hall	 172.63885717271336
Until she led him to a room	 155.59773083984825
Where none could hear him call.	 438.7558876967809
She took a penknife out of her pocket	 52.51316011343414
And cut off his little head.	 143.22586091990843
And now he’ll play his ball no more	 215.47307505536799
For he lies among the dead.	 250.30806408062412
[Illustration]	 4.608171674364364
How did the father of Millicent receive this second part?	 674.9218700613778
With mixed feelings. Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew’s	 235.306091724171
daughter, all dressed in green.	 1082.5538495099452
Condense Stephen’s commentary.	 158.82249546507262
One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. Once by	 55.9384060231886
inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny. It comes when	 1710.3737656823266
he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of	 25.43810007885606
hope and youth, holds him unresisting. It leads him to a strange	 184.48987199390004
habitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable,	 32.61332125117555
immolates him, consenting.	 25.24051162883539
Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?	 221.64930483364935
He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him	 255.12447012351166
should by him not be told.	 681.3101258999852
Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?	 181.61859939175008
In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.	 13.869280503171163
Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?	 848.4794683817752
He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the	 169.0206119186122
incitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the	 7.2718079241444675
propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of	 7.674538790605482
opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of	 13.151515129565661
atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism,	 5.77928110927027
hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.	 5.255505758698569
From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not	 125.88447553280953
totally immune?	 4.411654744205047
From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his	 40.85551459229863
sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an	 94.23535544734106
indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds. From	 225.20636143222728
somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled	 244.954647549265
in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its	 45.347778113353094
destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain,	 276.52389118732395
sleeping.	 265838.8220855929
Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member	 333.7123481974382
of his family?	 62.44537857257021
Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent	 100.16294638822694
(Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an	 219.30634431936485
exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two	 61.31572609992792
figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression.	 646.5487614879492
What other infantile memories had he of her?	 176.81715973316238
15 June 1889. A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and	 225.69152026000566
lessen congestion. A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks	 128.2169154236175
her moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons, one, tloo,	 239.02134444015832
tlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark,	 723.7181750752549
she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau,	 35.07849714399013
Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British	 226.76116271590234
navy.	 40941.90131121429
What endemic characteristics were present?	 100.9351433778544
Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line	 14.461122454662684
of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant	 121.17109343276069
intervals to more distant intervals to its most distant intervals.	 216.1328155730684
What memories had he of her adolescence?	 99.94143993789562
She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess. On the duke’s	 14.643003723107721
lawn, entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to	 74.38210396228754
make and take away her photographic image (objection not stated). On	 964.089487128774
the South Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an	 53.36824561395999
individual of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and	 62.457218236667245
turned abruptly back (reason of change not stated). On the vigil of the	 405.2814885502107
15th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county	 274.95610162971303
Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year	 126.5045144960491
not stated).	 20409.939740026082
Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?	 79.89288230738569
Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.	 94.81335619658637
What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly,	 100.99813975914162
if differently?	 285.77274442721756
A temporary departure of his cat.	 66.99424505987008
Why similarly, why differently?	 103.14672078711361
Similarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male	 98.99453382758368
(Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian). Differently,	 76.35658519575287
because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the	 295.1099538059979
habitation.	 4.608171674364364
In other respects were their differences similar?	 295.61781195452505
In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in	 48.36298140019076
unexpectedness.	 4.608171674364364
As?	 418.81163035589316
Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it	 1784.8213270113276
for her (cf neckarching cat). Moreover, on the free surface of the lake	 31.08443148270152
in Stephen’s green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented	 235.43553783392207
spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the	 28.589814860119752
constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf	 17.943934153237947
mousewatching cat). Again, in order to remember the date, combatants,	 83.58102039355752
issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a	 116.82505992418852
plait of her hair (cf earwashing cat). Furthermore, silly Milly, she	 80.00674441249646
dreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a	 27.634460122493934
horse whose name had been Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a	 294.22880517395674
tumblerful of lemonade which it (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf	 164.71042000364503
hearthdreaming cat). Hence, in passivity, in economy, in the instinct	 78.47534415739943
of tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar.	 97.24604309587663
In what way had he utilised gifts (1) an owl, 2) a clock, given as	 344.8038066126166
matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?	 108.63050809536696
As object lessons to explain: 1) the nature and habits of oviparous	 693.6126564985498
animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of	 39.85431942210958
vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: 2) the principle of the	 29.38694679201564
pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation	 18.350637464108257
in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of	 72.38629678365416
clockwise moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of	 11.054299560543708
the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and	 224.1613185697845
the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination,	 29.255439366351048
_videlicet_, 5 5/11 minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical	 657.5302272341717
progression.	 4.608171674364364
In what manners did she reciprocate?	 125.01448524814653
She remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to	 80.10038746512603
him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware.	 53.77403009381657
She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had	 712.4396993601536
been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his	 158.56817342186778
necessities, anticipating his desires. She admired: a natural	 78.41070926866644
phenomenon having been explained by him to her she expressed the	 213.75813006941078
immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of	 66.52783127337455
his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.	 427.25268946574533
What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist,	 305.4066353418542
make to Stephen, noctambulist?	 188.82182486552804
To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and	 892.8015095208941
Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately	 36.9745735737301
above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of	 49.24505979356819
his host and hostess.	 60.77266678261816
What various advantages would or might have resulted from a	 283.5486460003912
prolongation of such an extemporisation?	 15.456137793712683
For the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study. For the	 63.9958381605558
host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction. For the	 29.429719363036227
hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian	 17.16779941607775
pronunciation.	 4.608171674364364
Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a	 592.9088652190615
hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent	 28.717664104382553
eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew’s	 32.90055557004351
daughter?	 4212.979295856946
Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother	 572.933695274739
through daughter.	 4753.568949658622
To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest	 158.5834264380686
return a monosyllabic negative answer?	 214.78871884572078
If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at	 112.02920343045734
Sydney Parade railway station, 14 October 1903.	 339.32117165936876
What inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the	 18.99354174089943
host?	 23012.518589313833
A statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment	 30.709946004442944
of Mrs Mary Dedalus (born Goulding), 26 June 1903, vigil of the	 783.9994847156199
anniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag).	 416.37189149027034
Was the proposal of asylum accepted?	 51.44894109761492
Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.	 32.29565725290449
What exchange of money took place between host and guest?	 3665.756656920542
The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (£	 356.4195588541152
1-7-0), one pound seven shillings sterling, advanced by the latter to	 1222.6540374852852
the former.	 173.03603955686734
What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified,	 481.85023872963495
declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?	 41.47049333018922
To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the	 87.42408727435665
residence of the instructed. To inaugurate a course of vocal	 22.417929290540055
instruction, place the residence of the instructress. To inaugurate a	 15.786668154291656
series of static, semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues,	 5.110388051574433
places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident	 81.63682092244402
in the same place), the _Ship_ hotel and tavern, 6 Lower Abbey street	 73.54231056351458
(W. and E. Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, 10	 146.15262526802712
Kildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles	 112.65652678365781
street, a public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a	 256.35924591919087
conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection	 129.26380658597427
of a right line drawn between their residences (if both speakers were	 540.3940239904933
resident in different places, fuck everyone who is reading this shit).	 115.54447944068059
What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually	 279.8290690511574
selfexcluding propositions?	 4.411654744205047
The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert	 85.495234998374
Hengler’s circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive	 26.246505248406503
particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring	 22.001633647542587
to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had	 119.34961170607117
publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his	 47.64549113340856
(the clown’s) papa. The imprevidibility of the future: once in the	 39.71324254590536
summer of 1898 he (Bloom) had marked a florin (2/-) with three notches	 855.8675317107444
on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and	 485.44306403879403
received by J. and T. Davy, family grocers, 1 Charlemont Mall, Grand	 1184.3627970065097
Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible,	 96.27252007024916
circuitous or direct, return.	 71.04335517316935
Was the clown Bloom’s son?	 255.05627233843475
No.	 333.58539190873347
Had Bloom’s coin returned?	 40363.43739422413
Never.	 875.4077038095098
Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?	 97.57628687511101
Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to	 107.07709084500544
amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and	 10.197971988902228
international animosity.	 4.411654744205047
He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible,	 180.05601519193777
eliminating these conditions?	 38.607291913959784
There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct	 49.46736463984768
from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of	 251.62014293729462
destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of	 17.76668681906453
the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and	 26.91357203267141
death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human	 28.417589070201146
females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable	 26.832617031456277
accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies	 39.651943855412014
and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital	 8.233352459981768
criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make	 18.716927064678828
terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres	 8.020319971023333
of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital	 31.99200604188902
growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through	 264.04985102738533
maturity to decay.	 11.017970152388628
Why did he desist from speculation?	 49.8335465389805
Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other	 24.477823341644854
more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena	 33.34236891199026
to be removed.	 921.552678296827
Did Stephen participate in his dejection?	 46.70484392045475
He affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding	 104.82334889807291
syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational	 70.68036563764721
reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon	 19.96515198518678
the incertitude of the void.	 5.0699873660488946
Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?	 127.98040933404647
Not verbally. Substantially.	 29.18390710764246
What comforted his misapprehension?	 40.970160882704626
That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from	 53.60055366809167
the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.	 20.798208341563075
In what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the	 105.41578937015622
exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation	 14.510141707102342
effected?	 4.608171674364364
Lighted Candle in Stick borne by	 2832.7672477346196
BLOOM	 75.63006035870652
Diaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by	 976.1805542646667
STEPHEN	 251.95865148121723
With what intonation _secreto_ of what commemorative psalm?	 42.555470325515756
The 113th, _modus peregrinus: In exitu Israël de Egypto: domus Jacob de	 22.254658628819477
populo barbaro_.	 4.411654744205047
What did each do at the door of egress?	 137.0338787740158
Bloom set the candlestick on the floor. Stephen put the hat on his	 54.49034396287298
head.	 1947.4942466296927
For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?	 66.2482357930653
For a cat.	 158.67898713168168
What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the	 167.46108833871997
guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from	 397.8702249404334
the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?	 19.68887171324913
The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.	 68.334128749237
With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his	 81.90501272004008
companion of various constellations?	 44.66032473356581
Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in	 11.103740852707814
incipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous	 11.368991667553967
scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an	 90.1298799267108
observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000	 36.677610373406516
ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of	 68.82910402312947
Sirius (alpha in Canis Maior) 10 lightyears (57,000,000,000,000 miles)	 36.51594879384508
distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of	 78.6621300718266
Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and	 50.231814963994495
sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could	 53.75909865195247
be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in	 88.61882100081735
1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of	 52.4938277688371
the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality	 142.6161318961777
evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote	 8.814041839957968
futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of	 58.65191170186363
allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.	 17.745497247008224
Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?	 112.75347824732233
Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of	 6.353772386492632
the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences	 45.08377161726328
concealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives	 86.99995557935542
and mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the	 7.45501155884586
incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible	 22.822621649047704
molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single	 8.246109675955864
pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white	 26.87824662423937
bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other	 170.1286815089616
bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies	 104.53579353711125
of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component	 60.11542856085913
bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division	 56.35982047664123
till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never	 1390.190671755186
reached.	 22602.117068806736
Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?	 43.14298201129918
Because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of	 152.75638332958306
the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a	 133.3844376858512
number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such	 46.95184797228017
magnitude and of so many places, e.g., the 9th power of the 9th power	 64.883007540306
of 9, that, the result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes	 90.85601281392582
of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would	 134.36340647118067
have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its	 46.971858691731704
printed integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of	 56.583425657173564
thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds	 532.0712217966087
of millions, billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of	 28.905113082653255
every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to	 49.6929526026474
the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers.	 63.61961909146354
Did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their	 15.578055074308576
satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and	 77.72036122328217
moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?	 127.76332953081325
Of a different order of difficulty. Conscious that the human organism,	 208.69930142395853
normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons, when	 19.261146588689122
elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere	 8.006585487234364
suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the	 64.83392480960538
line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was	 53.05361188139153
approximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo,	 7.369159353411248
when proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a	 139.16114365810543
working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more	 112.95275786613318
adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might	 33.22230516372556
subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian,	 32.716524024039394
Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an	 24.863080616159003
apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite	 41.88369818154109
differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would	 128.8694377773667
probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to	 276.53249438129006
vanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity.	 26.070408174825285
And the problem of possible redemption?	 183.9649145319304
The minor was proved by the major.	 75.10350289494781
Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered?	 258.1435595047331
The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white,	 171.545893157182
yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy:	 39.94989253895592
their magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions:	 161.398527259189
the waggoner’s star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular	 66.2705906008346
cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the	 10.605858098128214
interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous	 46.89977221481525
discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel,	 26.588507654868533
Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of	 9.618277340759128
distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite	 202.69349349031938
compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive	 20.45542296381516
and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin	 12.088830451748949
of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the	 51.44105680403125
birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric	 53.72234421668429
showers about the period of the feast of S. Lawrence (martyr, 10	 44.917019778545885
August): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon	 44.34493860885077
in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the	 186.98340781733432
appearance of a star (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating	 38.75868498817451
by night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and	 82.25305615262722
amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the	 20.520438938597096
period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent	 82.98256783599808
neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude)	 21.584893142842716
of similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and	 180.81880694115776
disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about	 8.87748289199186
the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of	 249.16628958495784
(presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably)	 50.77024683238277
appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about	 39.63991289444879
the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the	 92.44819061876181
constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph	 184.43324563907615
Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before	 231.06780726186258
or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena	 139.31973376597335
of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of	 13.70468891888969
wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of	 36.58786245920438
nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light,	 83.1318321511139
obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings.	 34.00385348661348
His (Bloom’s) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and	 130.10677897016777
allowing for possible error?	 130.29316542811495
That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not	 38.704575667603194
a heavenman. That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the	 56.99845670900047
known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the	 16.91399286473958
suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and	 92.85321005661974
of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in	 38.49776924765996
space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as	 331.1586770725974
a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present	 274.64210852452004
existence.	 101482.75187817251
Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?	 44.04118154639293
Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the	 37.82853192480915
delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection	 8.649185130242058
invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the	 6.635429139656678
satellite of their planet.	 13.839460860796796
Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological	 121.06488816723854
influences upon sublunary disasters?	 25.5347097959368
It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the	 76.3611066490944
nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to	 17.247735145458343
verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the	 27.669927638559685
sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.	 26.349685441567548
What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and	 127.67810402755767
woman?	 1824.5948963844178
Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian	 13.48184063721138
generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her	 15.001701886340962
luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising and	 51.47209336870162
setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced	 97.12778269614893
invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to	 15.869305504464874
inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent	 17.626276048969217
waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to	 173.35587677447805
render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil	 51.19874914190959
inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant	 30.52577705363807
implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm:	 39.496471099015835
the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the	 86.56928436138539
admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour,	 82.42954249848397
when visible: her attraction, when invisible.	 2783.8816006466186
What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom’s, who attracted Stephen’s,	 4408.270829201882
gaze?	 8183.415255755109
In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom’s) house the light of a	 75.67338872657291
paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller	 168.30833314847098
blind supplied by Frank O’Hara, window blind, curtain pole and	 1658.996839871671
revolving shutter manufacturer, 16 Aungier street.	 19.516815409516237
How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his	 83.71541975406441
wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?	 1293.4464295626021
With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued	 12.3598985065966
affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with	 78.45196611038105
suggestion.	 4.608171674364364
Both then were silent?	 2299.2375684000062
Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal	 88.39220096236555
flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.	 34.57384521304816
Were they indefinitely inactive?	 37.81453855061811
At Stephen’s suggestion, at Bloom’s instigation both, first Stephen,	 594.7611092766579
then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs	 191.78433540952796
of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual	 40.52778842462919
circumposition, their gazes, first Bloom’s, then Stephen’s, elevated to	 317.22015317261736
the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow.	 27.46395629017752
Similarly?	 4.608171674364364
The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations	 35.14412905796024
were dissimilar: Bloom’s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form	 225.1051210250303
of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate	 39.2675736661595
year at High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point of	 91.8940653515043
greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the	 90.44613769342772
institution, 210 scholars: Stephen’s higher, more sibilant, who in the	 350.77834443878254
ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic	 52.267318750013345
consumption an insistent vesical pressure.	 9.313553435509348
What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the	 789.9147520514001
invisible audible collateral organ of the other?	 28.90627026135468
To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity,	 13.672612007163256
reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pilosity.	 4.045570071155129
To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus	 35.99204659068051
circumcised (1 January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain	 30.52831158419678
from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine	 220.1967444532551
prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic	 18.027981080395083
church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of	 124.69918393023838
the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine	 20.49931378729287
excrescences as hair and toenails.	 53.450702880076506
What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?	 700.9503614701486
A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament	 44.73409204611424
from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the	 14.731466032492188
Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.	 54.23046853835489
How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal	 17.69405545615066
departer?	 4.608171674364364
By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an	 79.04669770522189
unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and	 252.35227411723602
turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its	 140.28232531527502
staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and	 80.47090163472228
revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.	 78.943864568081
How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?	 93.85853792666069
Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its	 447.8048508470843
base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and	 525.0480630126151
forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.	 738.6517925932661
What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of	 267.75354454087756
their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?	 23.971080473079372
The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the	 13.546436886223871
bells in the church of Saint George.	 374.600274839985
What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?	 509.16610106369694
By Stephen:	 390.7738290182327
Liliata rutilantium. Turma circumdet.	 4.045570071155129
Iubilantium te virginum. Chorus excipiat.	 11.425970424023346
By Bloom:	 1174.1088481011202
Heigho, heigho,	 73.30071059716788
Heigho, heigho.	 73.30071059716788
Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day	 389.3289857368921
at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south	 121.78096792669704
to Glasnevin in the north?	 33.67436819896432
Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in	 231.1351125112563
bed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed),	 274.0411715212262
John Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in	 135.4585548453399
bed), Paddy Dignam (in the grave).	 228.14149003541894
Alone, what did Bloom hear?	 749.0786292727803
The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth,	 54.028693952813015
the double vibration of a jew’s harp in the resonant lane.	 85.46153016337743
Alone, what did Bloom feel?	 930.7563291203295
The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing	 158.13116465933683
point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Réaumur: the	 22.723436639414516
incipient intimations of proximate dawn.	 5.411733456493961
Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind	 46.41676875312884
him?	 330.5397417229756
Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy	 44.77911789317497
Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis,	 617.5975399660683
Jervis Street hospital), Matthew F. Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin	 110.05017530756963
Bay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart	 490.37890774245574
(phthisis, Mater Misericordiae hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy,	 581.1787159573768
Sandymount).	 44981.53824089885
What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?	 289.9466772825102
The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the	 90.12829287563994
apparition of a new solar disk.	 16.091974006939452
Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?	 57.166546682142865
Once, in 1887, after a protracted performance of charades in the house	 38.487169150198106
of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of	 17.23922281064364
the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the	 108.05508345860797
direction of Mizrach, the east.	 32.21011118545099
He remembered the initial paraphenomena?	 30.439926735245404
More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at	 204.6182272030822
various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer,	 235.9473160449586
the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the	 47.57565363693636
first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.	 156.37114157854649
Did he remain?	 646.5979380884621
With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering	 313.33451246229026
the passage, reclosing the door. With brief suspiration he reassumed	 150.97955579469206
the candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front	 60.72650257093119
room, hallfloor, and reentered.	 73.27521789560794
What suddenly arrested his ingress?	 154.61489664455632
The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into	 44.89585301301334
contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible	 49.730089034031984
fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in	 43.57803762497807
consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.	 10.63556120310698
Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of	 15.213042333797269
furniture.	 4.608171674364364
A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite	 33.96899326439494
the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an	 80.01176141535153
alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and	 23.074251433413245
white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the	 267.6079265949664
door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard	 15.663499176404104
(a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had	 38.01581458763336
been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but	 275.95080641586225
more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved	 457.946449490917
from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally	 105.8371208248578
occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.	 44.56827444309252
Describe them.	 48.605392929719166
One: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back	 99.83185511833439
slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an	 96.95764177338748
irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply	 15.681465052362281
upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing	 40.010572157426
discolouration. The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane	 125.11929055874323
curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat	 3499.8867751034754
and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a	 4157.881650816681
bright circle of white plaited rush.	 691.3524788949497
What significances attached to these two chairs?	 615.8745998445944
Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of	 10.614275492707481
circumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence.	 36.06578708374894
What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?	 37.76609507254349
A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin	 227.52273676207864
supporting a pair of long yellow ladies’ gloves and an emerald ashtray	 195.55464265509903
containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two	 69.21139143583841
discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in	 301.173325566798
the key of G natural for voice and piano of _Love’s Old Sweet Song_	 473.77001399159275
(words by G. Clifton Bingham, composed by J. L. Molloy, sung by Madam	 71.17768021844998
Antoinette Sterling) open at the last page with the final indications	 222.98049831798124
_ad libitum, forte_, pedal, _animato_, sustained pedal, _ritirando_,	 29.304813777473445
close.	 16472.253105574895
With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?	 110.77026343629062
With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right	 252.80199339027862
temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a	 107.70823601814244
large dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation,	 152.28280088283375
bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement,	 72.61962550712566
remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan’s scheme of colour containing the	 88.17613770725508
gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent	 61.248692086946626
act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the	 63.65622032771943
consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual	 18.751366489209584
discolouration.	 4.608171674364364
His next proceeding?	 207.00650723823634
From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black	 119.7580435036212
diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on	 752.3794836812658
a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the	 159.9760984625965
mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus	 474.08072333550984
(illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it	 34.788197381687354
superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the	 59.01810902032793
candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the	 39.64318543974117
latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin	 36.10502227765363
of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to	 97.77055515476064
facilitate total combustion.	 4.206040932916629
What followed this operation?	 665.1599039723404
The truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a	 6.55012172167556
vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.	 15.534836030799662
What homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the	 86.57727480238447
mantelpiece?	 22286.59433824737
A timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4.46	 14.683875096451024
a.m. on the 21 March 1896, matrimonial gift of Matthew Dillon: a dwarf	 183.3839522008745
tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial	 55.30258709193233
gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of	 37.215451462113684
Alderman John Hooper.	 337.1970088921631
What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and	 458.2554751687921
Bloom?	 75.63006035870652
In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the	 17.00753459697253
dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl. Before the	 111.35223153734474
mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear	 382.7229227054204
melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom	 177.56773796038587
while Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated	 20.488027984229365
gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.	 31.093897535527496
What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his	 69.0529427993243
attention?	 26345.262521978115
The image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.	 13.535839910038426
Why solitary (ipsorelative)?	 39.49092819471651
Brothers and sisters had he none.	 2298.788442705427
Yet that man’s father was his grandfather’s son.	 312.86492725333426
Why mutable (aliorelative)?	 39.49092819471651
From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix.	 18.67614143948372
From maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal	 25.947795381255368
procreator.	 4.608171674364364
What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?	 106.2791316892954
The optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged	 11.578049534866281
and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles	 107.1856749511151
on the two bookshelves opposite.	 124.070768002151

the fineſt place in the world.	 27.691373082920467
What reflections occupied his mind during the process of reversion of	 48.06605750572772
the inverted volumes?	 6.922777768218444
The necessity of order, a place for everything and everything in its	 119.0493441096067
place: the deficient appreciation of literature possessed by females:	 197.01567172339517
the incongruity of an apple incuneated in a tumbler and of an umbrella	 91.09138471427099
inclined in a closestool: the insecurity of hiding any secret document	 390.364476550071
behind, beneath or between the pages of a book.	 654.5938964364987
Which volume was the largest in bulk?	 26.093396346224036
Hozier’s _History of the Russo-Turkish War._	 56.319334003621904
What among other data did the second volume of the work in question	 224.05057040096935
contain?	 4.608171674364364
The name of a decisive battle (forgotten), frequently remembered by a	 95.19050993787675
decisive officer, major Brian Cooper Tweedy (remembered).	 4217.302221393517
Why, firstly and secondly, did he not consult the work in question?	 71.82376394517776
Firstly, in order to exercise mnemotechnic: secondly, because after an	 57.757327423529894
interval of amnesia, when, seated at the central table, about to	 107.75821919519112
consult the work in question, he remembered by mnemotechnic the name of	 97.63349684912464
the military engagement, Plevna.	 6.227357202309961
What caused him consolation in his sitting posture?	 95.54812621926982
The candour, nudity, pose, tranquility, youth, grace, sex, counsel of a	 104.5721676052661
statue erect in the centre of the table, an image of Narcissus	 104.47748834328247
purchased by auction from P. A. Wren, 9 Bachelor’s Walk.	 200.30337426383966
What caused him irritation in his sitting posture?	 95.54812621926982
Inhibitory pressure of collar (size 17) and waistcoat (5 buttons), two	 1670.9165629340803
articles of clothing superfluous in the costume of mature males and	 65.16335248277774
inelastic to alterations of mass by expansion.	 66.98666620970806
How was the irritation allayed?	 43.27670447557485
He removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible	 45.28328566699547
stud, from his neck to a position on the left of the table. He	 75.13740285585195
unbuttoned successively in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers,	 66.9010820740144
shirt and vest along the medial line of irregular incrispated black	 60.15584106221409
hairs extending in triangular convergence from the pelvic basin over	 9.888405163550294
the circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle along the	 9.136236432561773
medial line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral	 11.195732864365263
vertebrae, thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in	 175.84572479439927
circles described about two equidistant points, right and left, on the	 147.19155685313856
summits of the mammary prominences. He unbraced successively each of	 17.55845915180044
six minus one braced trouser buttons, arranged in pairs, of which one	 81.12835995393331
incomplete.	 4.608171674364364
What involuntary actions followed?	 180.98955666909384
He compressed between 2 fingers the flesh circumjacent to a cicatrice	 153.43151171633892
in the left infracostal region below the diaphragm resulting from a	 60.11152055740826
sting inflicted 2 weeks and 3 days previously (23 May 1904) by a bee.	 459.9408973075777
He scratched imprecisely with his right hand, though insensible of	 38.923654965241134
prurition, various points and surfaces of his partly exposed, wholly	 22.02857775067786
abluted skin. He inserted his left hand into the left lower pocket of	 85.4358799352476
his waistcoat and extracted and replaced a silver coin (1 shilling),	 147.0039169868209
placed there (presumably) on the occasion (17 October 1903) of the	 195.21166096521208

taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves).	 914.7907923947181
Leopold Bloom (aged 6) had accompanied these narrations by constant	 839.4435550164593
consultation of a geographical map of Europe (political) and by	 17.966155114104037
suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in	 179.79760593226243
the various centres mentioned.	 243.77918154164405

migrations in narrator and listener?	 7.844487701851272
In narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of	 26.90445127554584

Occasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat.	 173.89659117167193
Occasionally he drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an	 48.67597359129001
inclined plate. Occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of	 197.16108757274597
food by means of a lacerated envelope or other accessible fragment of	 91.09206314664759
paper.	 5819.797042009735
What two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?	 78.09359649401418
The myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon	 24.022049879909563
repletion.	 4.608171674364364
What object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?	 787.2216205415568
The endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the	 35.62259102695582
possession of scrip.	 6.750982139479042
Reduce Bloom by cross multiplication of reverses of fortune, from which	 143.0997764863583
these supports protected him, and by elimination of all positive values	 27.69324151217762
to a negligible negative irrational unreal quantity.	 8.63387294607817
Successively, in descending helotic order: Poverty: that of the outdoor	 21.246792461731786
hawker of imitation jewellery, the dun for the recovery of bad and	 13.836379593529823
doubtful debts, the poor rate and deputy cess collector. Mendicancy:	 28.907315813151314

public laughingstock seated on bench of public park under discarded	 1112.6680207624868
perforated umbrella. Destitution: the inmate of Old Man’s House (Royal	 102.27999458884727
Hospital), Kilmainham, the inmate of Simpson’s Hospital for reduced but	 71.6195417570922

pauper.	 4.608171674364364
With which attendant indignities?	 27.513737095084604
The unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the	 20.973762942492964
contempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the	 28.86437110383696
simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of	 5.727331782039018
illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of	 15.148064366253223
decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing, nothing or less	 560.0912504198254
than nothing.	 1930.6004234092456
By what could such a situation be precluded?	 304.350384975836
By decease (change of state): by departure (change of place).	 228.02580120640553
Which preferably?	 80.24436446956989
The latter, by the line of least resistance.	 51.81824097919309
What considerations rendered departure not entirely undesirable?	 132.10977103063263
Constant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal defects.	 134.70450724238103

necessity to counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of	 9.478629682427096
arrest.	 4.608171674364364
What considerations rendered departure not irrational?	 206.57390501084933
The parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which	 18.38733443469345
being done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if	 67.92209222393092
not disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication,	 86.77441641293059
which was absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting	 242.5548692781194
parties, which was impossible.	 21.995007334126996
What considerations rendered departure desirable?	 148.27711903194847
The attractive character of certain localities in Ireland and abroad,	 39.10849338152959
as represented in general geographical maps of polychrome design or in	 68.27124404961616
special ordnance survey charts by employment of scale numerals and	 15.647252643758213

returns), the bay of Naples (to see which was to die), the Dead Sea.	 113.3843861972219
Under what guidance, following what signs?	 1562.0312978538725
At sea, septentrional, by night the polestar, located at the point of	 35.97643416046281
intersection of the right line from beta to alpha in Ursa Maior	 57.484060050434636
produced and divided externally at omega and the hypotenuse of the	 18.906143575623123
rightangled triangle formed by the line alpha omega so produced and the	 45.358046268379645
line alpha delta of Ursa Maior. On land, meridional, a bispherical	 46.93929826438231
moon, revealed in imperfect varying phases of lunation through the	 92.67968232714948
posterior interstice of the imperfectly occluded skirt of a carnose	 15.252586062534546
negligent perambulating female, a pillar of the cloud by day.	 93.01439537774026
What public advertisement would divulge the occultation of the	 190.4087351482139
departed?	 4.608171674364364
£ 5 reward, lost, stolen or strayed from his residence 7 Eccles street,	 43.28487286907902

height 5 ft 9 1/2 inches, full build, olive complexion, may have since	 185.12502520159083
grown a beard, when last seen was wearing a black suit. Above sum will	 2541.0446913979013
be paid for information leading to his discovery.	 199.89831236430416
What universal binomial denominations would be his as entity and	 185.8600697750838
nonentity?	 4.608171674364364

What tributes his?	 96.56077730322501
Honour and gifts of strangers, the friends of Everyman. A nymph	 53.449925523688364
immortal, beauty, the bride of Noman.	 237.25459832430332
Would the departed never nowhere nohow reappear?	 52.19908625769081
Ever he would wander, selfcompelled, to the extreme limit of his	 44.38246362488911
cometary orbit, beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic	 128.36935399048133
planets, astronomical waifs and strays, to the extreme boundary of	 6.121722152608933
space, passing from land to land, among peoples, amid events. Somewhere	 1583.2707564225639
imperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey	 78.52481275414046
the summons of recall. Whence, disappearing from the constellation of	 5.987615159706353
the Northern Crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the	 126.61098398814967
constellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of	 13.760949539776515
peregrination return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on	 44.24483006468049
malefactors, a dark crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial	 16.60124374039503
resources (by supposition) surpassing those of Rothschild or the silver	 43.438997937189626
king.	 7438.389192864764
What would render such return irrational?	 299.3167513629053

reversible space and an exodus and return in space through irreversible	 113.05692449810758
time.	 1255.9227614779093
What play of forces, inducing inertia, rendered departure undesirable?	 83.51285967822245
The lateness of the hour, rendering procrastinatory: the obscurity of	 12.262659915437201
the night, rendering invisible: the uncertainty of thoroughfares,	 13.311062854423437
rendering perilous: the necessity for repose, obviating movement: the	 131.74606032529053
proximity of an occupied bed, obviating research: the anticipation of	 16.205585730138132
warmth (human) tempered with coolness (linen), obviating desire and	 103.83429077178926
rendering desirable: the statue of Narcissus, sound without echo,	 235.25360643017297
desired desire.	 194.33996239971086
What advantages were possessed by an occupied, as distinct from an	 58.04878936846008
unoccupied bed?	 209.8579355628752
The removal of nocturnal solitude, the superior quality of human	 9.537770103634326
(mature female) to inhuman (hotwaterjar) calefaction, the stimulation	 20.434921316133167
of matutinal contact, the economy of mangling done on the premises in	 23.09672854732675

the spring mattress (striped) and the woollen mattress (biscuit	 69.58109829926643
section).	 4.608171674364364
What past consecutive causes, before rising preapprehended, of	 989.1217108154517

period of time including a cardrive, a visit to a house of mourning, a	 233.49852277731867
leavetaking (wilderness): the eroticism produced by feminine	 18.15742569510272
exhibitionism (rite of Onan): the prolonged delivery of Mrs Mina	 37.85259021168038
Purefoy (heave offering): the visit to the disorderly house of Mrs	 119.01549672953522
Bella Cohen, 82 Tyrone street, lower, and subsequent brawl and chance	 232.31859919545016
medley in Beaver street (Armageddon): nocturnal perambulation to and	 13.872410962540611
from the cabman’s shelter, Butt Bridge (atonement).	 149.87861412715966

conclude lest he should not conclude involuntarily apprehend?	 22.141238850132417

apprehending, not comprehend?	 27.24342041556288

What selfevident enigma pondered with desultory constancy during 30	 28.333332140931873
years did Bloom now, having effected natural obscurity by the	 485.1353061104479
extinction of artificial light, silently suddenly comprehend?	 154.507893395743
Where was Moses when the candle went out?	 279.4410077300355
What imperfections in a perfect day did Bloom, walking, charged with	 327.2471446820131
collected articles of recently disvested male wearing apparel,	 327.0485008355367
silently, successively, enumerate?	 112.63359486857362
A provisional failure to obtain renewal of an advertisement: to obtain	 22.488852218038662

meeting at infinity, if produced: along parallel lines, reproduced from	 1008.0730489964353

articles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the	 77.61753390088107
bed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the	 163.3779066597447
proper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to	 208.165922722758
the foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the	 23.68751481009891
bed.	 4805.270169561878
How?	 525.1537151301238
With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or	 189.72471003249345
not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress	 22.490604167177324
being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous	 91.13937419375591
under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of	 211.29903359239373
lust or adders: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of	 203.80973396363805

marriage, of sleep and of death.	 429.80497272256974

some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.	 96.91045657685437
If he had smiled why would he have smiled?	 344.38409164756223
To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to	 66.30806890187193
enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if	 127.36444557112844
the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first,	 56.62246943641448
last, only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor	 1838.8581728101217
alone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity.	 81.54824209621958

bootblack at the General Post Office, Hugh E. (Blazes) Boylan and so	 133.79512048746344
each and so on to no last term.	 326.4149928317058
What were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and	 98.28485512363362
late occupant of the bed?	 97.43388168726044
Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a	 12.313385859127358
billsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a	 8.684661852079438
boaster).	 4.608171674364364
Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal	 22.926674885999397
proportion and commercial ability?	 5.618279234239429
Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding	 38.626667049393994
members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably	 41.50776432576506
transmitted, first with alarm, then with understanding, then with	 578.7254522804817
desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene	 24.166301305538177
comprehension and apprehension.	 6.065069416742295
With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections	 60.6975718809292
affected?	 4.608171674364364
Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.	 4.045570071155129
Envy?	 4.608171674364364
Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the	 23.18426207088256
superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic	 10.847619773283517
piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of	 20.336932165214893
a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental	 15.969431017673495
female organism, passive but not obtuse.	 57.60504742343887
Jealousy?	 4.608171674364364
Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately	 329.60164306509733
the agent and reagent of attraction. Because attraction between	 31.49504471041854
agent(s) and reagent(s) at all instants varied, with inverse proportion	 11.075847157924366
of increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial	 17.787178998579854
reentrance. Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of	 9.179371726178905
attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.	 88.30006126880134
Abnegation?	 4.608171674364364
In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the	 24.50074496450786
establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden	 997.5808551534701
Quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and	 534.8506116433306
reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of	 232.38432615020625
ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d)	 14.186691840573532
extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial	 3.933542382544028
prerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current	 1086.5752954417392
expenses, net proceeds divided.	 4.045570071155129
Equanimity?	 4.608171674364364
As as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or	 2068.5788179650453
understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in	 136.58736101108042
accordance with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar	 47.54079939728912
similarity. As not so calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the	 19.262153687745368
planet in consequence of a collision with a dark sun. As less	 112.70270408221924
reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and	 54.26369453000664
animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement,	 243.3873220975356
misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust,	 253.31493127986533
malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail,	 4.545209684235337
contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas,	 58.311245079089936
trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion	 19.405993297065987
from armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence	 18.656487410933284
with the king’s enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter,	 18.662920187352295
wilful and premeditated murder. As not more abnormal than all other	 83.52409891532905
parallel processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence,	 20.165258657016533
resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and	 10.735559126685525
its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits,	 8.89371344022781
indulged inclinations, significant disease. As more than inevitable,	 87.24476281116345
irreparable.	 4.608171674364364
Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?	 195.34216033685254
From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but	 66.09160932943172
outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially	 10.282591149784418
violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the	 14.123870078759605
adulterously violated.	 4.411654744205047
What retribution, if any?	 466.07651207335135
Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right. Duel by	 185.76772525258875
combat, no. Divorce, not now. Exposure by mechanical artifice	 28.185246910402316
(automatic bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses),	 14.746944309080403
not yet. Suit for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault	 306.22477920959506
with evidence of injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly.	 169.29077811115692
Hushmoney by moral influence, possibly. If any, positively, connivance,	 3255.0215399648387
introduction of emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of	 6.7802471896955305
publicity: moral, a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation,	 17.682022800942867
alienation, humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from	 16.249936012374622
the other, protecting the separator from both.	 54.83126357224915
By what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void of	 154.97376070860344
incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?	 18.512485640122662
The preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed	 6.541963627362234
intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion	 30.778368089582656
between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and	 34.236303024032985
the selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously	 19.224604584180426
inferred debility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the	 31.673677744576718
variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by	 27.539306904762224
inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite	 27.343675720509452
proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic	 27.963939985817316
transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into	 41.44054380952627
its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine	 15.298111202274756
subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past	 55.63409491630147
participle with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice:	 11.783168583316824
the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual	 9.974922559136532
production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest	 10.766955974256351
or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of	 36.710446093138195
nescient matter: the apathy of the stars.	 44.8019038701724
In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and	 274.54934246710206
reflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge?	 32.32282373683984
Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial	 10.19078055163642
hemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored	 38.560892091955694
(the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of	 51.23616994057012
Greece, the land of promise), of adipose anterior and posterior female	 25.715345906032226
hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and	 46.06835151224039
seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude,	 59.840280393562644
insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression,	 17.74551474526986
expressive of mute immutable mature animality.	 30.379019713746068
The visible signs of antesatisfaction?	 290.8062537149286
An approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a	 14.212806322789584
tentative revelation: a silent contemplation.	 30.22440637993345
Then?	 434.61057492991284
He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each	 85.86361312127731
plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure	 43.67411412272098
prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.	 4.045570071155129
The visible signs of postsatisfaction?	 290.8062537149286
A silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a	 24.043393867406206
solicitous aversion: a proximate erection.	 6.598657538509151
What followed this silent action?	 11276.592320099657
Somnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation,	 14.579249508862608
catechetical interrogation.	 4.411654744205047
With what modifications did the narrator reply to this interrogation?	 125.41347294020369
Negative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between	 32.53139881689383
Martha Clifford and Henry Flower, the public altercation at, in and in	 163.88563782891595
the vicinity of the licensed premises of Bernard Kiernan and Co,	 38.595311053999836
Limited, 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street, the erotic provocation and	 47.41379347829529
response thereto caused by the exhibitionism of Gertrude (Gerty),	 13.957187048184434

Bandmann Palmer of _Leah_ at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South	 72.83603768671436
King street, an invitation to supper at Wynn’s (Murphy’s) Hotel, 35, 36	 186.49493070856536

tendency entituled _Sweets of Sin_, anonymous author a gentleman of	 29.146701526405764
fashion, a temporary concussion caused by a falsely calculated movement	 38.59398309647747
in the course of a postcenal gymnastic display, the victim (since	 27.33575872140154
completely recovered) being Stephen Dedalus, professor and author,	 223.46965052014133
eldest surviving son of Simon Dedalus, of no fixed occupation, an	 101.17512707196882
aeronautical feat executed by him (narrator) in the presence of a	 16.64650928900486
witness, the professor and author aforesaid, with promptitude of	 114.84685151114347
decision and gymnastic flexibility.	 5.618279234239429

perceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the	 54.60693141284091
course of this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration?	 30.394794129150085
By the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had been	 43.89818878590947
celebrated 1 calendar month after the 18th anniversary of her birth (8	 55.022512277976325
September 1870), viz. 8 October, and consummated on the same date with	 29.226239323847185
female issue born 15 June 1889, having been anticipatorily consummated	 724.7750399936751
on the 10 September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse,	 26.65907177300718
with ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last	 497.1202286502057
taken place 5 weeks previous, viz. 27 November 1893, to the birth on 29	 206.31770380212328
December 1893 of second (and only male) issue, deceased 9 January 1894,	 368.6535919276447

during which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without	 79.15530510693424
ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ. By the narrator a	 103.57131470289771
limitation of activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete	 8.744601514039612
mental intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place	 48.020803578500164
since the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage,	 17.271563011225666
of the female issue of narrator and listener, 15 September 1903, there	 225.75395223955735
remained a period of 9 months and 1 day during which, in consequence of	 199.07677491994917
a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the	 48.78220453519646
consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of	 132.0707979877647
action had been circumscribed.	 163.93927991235074
How?	 525.1537151301238
By various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine	 20.730545128976456

thoughts?	 20342.57360115064
The upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of	 44.72528372122992

In what directions did listener and narrator lie?	 150.13002653193706

finger and thumb of the right hand resting on the bridge of the nose,	 86.43042672816011
in the attitude depicted in a snapshot photograph made by Percy Apjohn,	 13.734544575653821
the childman weary, the manchild in the womb.	 56.23474296504145
Womb? Weary?	 13997.629698952534

•	 4.608171674364364
[ 18 ]	 463.94842625767166
Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his	 131.45868930004775
breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the _City Arms_ hotel when	 126.97232651319582
he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his	 69.03506164555593
highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan	 81.81664330199192
that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing	 67.8092543285869
all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was	 408.84346942784185
actually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all	 168.95524257057994
her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and	 60.04856508793083
earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God	 72.30884123505498
help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and	 261.346322068508

welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here	 299.3680822784814
and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her	 57.0036802780386
dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats	 210.8988618112881
especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that	 108.4305583651625
and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always	 124.65452026221446
if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much	 433.78148596387564
better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I	 483.96452778709397
suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have	 111.29602184002631
a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till	 1215.9542456034349
they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as	 103.93541626574375

sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was	 179.5824506886971
O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he	 73.17085505781019
sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day	 123.82190170569446
I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones	 831.8868267528245
she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into	 197.42451822109868
a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying	 88.90513279929026
on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more	 283.5061848194431
like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same	 61.94163774185468
besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor	 142.66594263817547
paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I	 90.8428191233412
was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it	 304.24089859356536

his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her	 161.1601184563862
so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was	 88.2045733061256
really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it	 199.68301381126335
planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember	 258.5191877663924
Menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he	 169.01117692998423
not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and	 101.8161210929599
turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what	 475.3065028354193
harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to	 106.16524166370306
him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever	 329.76143727440643
met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle	 529.723779071448
in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in	 569.8704755961438
with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as	 215.7882791801956
I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a	 361.9767387119519
letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the	 135.38246474623656
paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the	 84.04157450338353
blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably	 210.07060873573278
that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all	 243.7042753452615
men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is	 212.83839462966313
now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old	 192.7323886774201
fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I	 637.4287621259004
care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though	 294.10074700515577
Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my	 77.92105356815678
nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace	 115.96969694221767
padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell	 340.6592042690699
of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by	 445.41773909740476
getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat	 137.7039879118793
without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was	 98.5734432992337
drinking water 1 woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of	 224.74169635419193
course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table	 320.8657275035259
on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing	 108.74702948868915
my potatoes and the oysters 2/6 per doz going out to see her aunt if	 291.2632047402151
you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on	 130.65508314784424
with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you	 68.55994314902502
have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters	 355.8026620459643
but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be	 44.93603359692526
alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I	 340.9979930808796
found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a	 281.1644112967356
little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave	 80.87755263843444
her her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do	 960.6443213424286
out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out	 396.4562257216675
the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I	 254.93388915347234
couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar	 50.574982678406776
and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the	 67.35186851971511
place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because	 256.14557691317674
he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere	 401.7643301268892
and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan	 176.3647551681089
gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there	 83.45719810063552
steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb	 234.46261495574876
to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he	 179.87754690817104
has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out	 104.52934452667014
and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the	 40.454711805228584
satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be	 112.25398463693361
always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking	 322.11329399491905
boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id	 130.69853730662865
confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my	 104.46301330898869
garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I	 459.00008745569835
know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging	 212.21601643405384
drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this	 297.8080675306293
that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would	 100.06717489530945
because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in	 292.9208856903228
the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a	 112.19038095310273
stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and	 153.97998089314189
he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he	 711.4585090471811
is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it	 109.56920682889526
tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine	 167.20191813890003
Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what	 123.10592776810023
he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply	 144.22410855821536
ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it	 68.31722366197005
till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your	 170.06270268673984
lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the	 558.6848115245738
world about it people make its only the first time after that its just	 491.4542962751542
the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man	 203.25524177737807
without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when	 238.4940040486287
you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish	 230.15316427279646
some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in	 133.81201580780083
his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul	 262.7639446281821
almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to	 186.01761789628375
Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and	 161.5460694717077
I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my	 233.83545578863544
child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where	 553.3871534885727
you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done	 693.4208739443162
with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put	 280.0119427473736
it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he	 123.11956470341497
want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat	 172.00768937799677
hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he	 1555.228850374137
Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in	 42.69153568880448
the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never	 149.86783194656005
turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost	 692.8041628151261
for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them	 427.4977974097437
Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense	 44.56672293721816
off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre	 228.48762347621116
married hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the	 2186.8819807450122
pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt	 40.287254057288045
like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though	 273.5405721130019
I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of	 87.0503422995912
his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it	 113.17772344517078
who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of	 226.5252233791077
drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they	 368.5930145365381
stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking	 175.89182036162026
green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with	 915.4694178608596
the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American	 428.9381954634069
that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do	 263.27145987544816
to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took	 338.30669710483687
the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt	 264.89302077475065
lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I	 863.5157148282859
popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful	 1268.536272928845
to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when	 318.7228102213191
I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in	 812.0553309585191
Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and	 137.85110457837268
tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing	 104.46539976294677
about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that	 295.38940885696906
evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it	 261.4083337567208
brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to	 313.05059350661026
church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only	 1352.4102117465425
grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I	 192.2409083371062
lit the lamp because he must have come 3 or 4 times with that	 504.3550930804603
tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or	 261.9070182656442
whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is	 124.63826460811511
not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my	 207.30142646288044
hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a	 210.12904717271354
thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think	 242.0664366927403
a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life	 291.97236818415746
felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must	 284.9375472512827
have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with	 367.5850924832397
a big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into	 121.69110479737122
you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious	 93.42453713583915
look in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a	 67.30400534761003
tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on	 143.55660221372526
me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt	 238.64284644618732
washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice	 234.98844444809112
invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if	 152.24889756950716
someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went	 124.67351430081399
through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina	 1313.111857984368
Purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up	 43.78413185616794
with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a	 359.3896652916122
smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like	 274.6980739795197
a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the	 71.26329254750777
last time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and	 72.60681047476415
bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied	 233.58128407175042
till they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what	 334.29043268736797
supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was	 127.44375700146199
married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has	 471.9506708974336
more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting	 362.3322237136778
Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him	 183.1936109425046
off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I	 402.38041747337934
know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing	 119.75951001213349
and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming	 49.90530616132716
and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not	 73.59752904436168
liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over	 46.921393339938234
politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a	 155.7501575728806
carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive	 95.72140338866099
about everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for	 352.49065940494665
I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he	 52.99002343162217
annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot	 83.91039432382446
of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often	 156.08277120400697
wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family	 372.3082690353028
physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was	 269.8831641118363
crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with	 59.684343330420624
her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever	 96.04151693393645
he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me	 68.5578179476696
the present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that	 85.11344800026015
finished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I	 265.11237656768833
know how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out	 116.43535888209871
to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know	 159.11008120413274
plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch	 269.19576867945193
him with my veil and gloves on going out 1 kiss then would send them	 1005.0336114604053
all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of	 182.9360526431501
course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him	 353.47258576142264
that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love	 160.06694318663025
him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might	 309.35338616575496
imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of	 69.22038068606909
a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it	 155.83254105020828
out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and	 240.65258944251494
wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the	 126.00953429294493
night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I	 626.8623656456826
want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper	 90.97347396624141
with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too	 190.56405305196947
much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know	 146.68851593186176
more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie	 64.4820681887616
whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I	 261.6854568055802
said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash	 192.21120618318636
possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick	 297.41749762258496
when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the	 181.3568369051249
indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what	 122.89699985788685
spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at	 178.99583004906683
that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was	 206.78813818685464
too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged	 253.75226414867961
afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of	 42.85098975614255
laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling	 195.23676693129985
out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great	 241.35275538811547
humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it	 126.39910288735803
meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us	 211.66108610372942
not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault	 127.63676413798568
she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes	 193.47266122983325
got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her	 300.9772869220462
face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she	 210.0281343749537
must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment	 85.36673650612742
she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk	 69.24138367048263
about him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes	 128.27611693692782
he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him	 59.83214823894362
just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might	 101.5730125689245
murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes	 915.108660463705
mad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when	 748.3506862512475
he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he	 110.50153564916543
always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and	 127.74556776183655
now hes going about in his slippers to look for £ 10000 for a postcard	 245.24211330689445
U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff	 742.245510838121
to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what	 427.08843909078337
could you make of a man like that Id rather die 20 times over than	 401.65529475964024
marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like	 385.193119665388
me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and	 140.54411294710195
he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick	 113.6866684243562
that poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man	 160.28877330480333
yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and	 53.75402175286604
do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating	 103.52933166349521
drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask	 285.21441279372897
us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because	 226.76965408288993
they cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off	 536.3188060985051
flypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say	 49.11722617389553
its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have	 276.35321583564166
been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being	 102.64957257550864
hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do	 479.1064121678734
besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they	 1100.7243181406598
theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he	 137.6242906722458
noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C	 55.294145705226136
with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both	 421.1592708814863
ordered 2 teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his	 146.42099902720835
two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it	 134.49944509510905
was what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed	 321.17446122217444
breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting	 445.0490735871763
all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long	 416.57206456535886
one I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got	 171.9408186637983

times lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to	 145.62562083340308
Mrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the	 71.34514573834971
turning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea	 183.29685687367765
2 days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him	 172.02568356700127
because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he	 171.31824431002246
meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that	 299.57840376937486
if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill	 269.840965716504
stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still	 191.84597540468573
I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of	 229.63804046280282
a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to	 248.25146374171163
mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my	 111.17593786381907
stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another	 73.45270086835293
time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I	 167.0950621322008
could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world	 112.32437417072644
that I what did he say I could give 9 points in 10 to Katty Lanner and	 171.16850384072367
beat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because	 141.4970325144559
the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in	 54.20521163247585
the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere	 50.293564833076466
I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell	 99.87829023820933
DArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on	 139.10214176102488
the choir stairs after I sang Gounods _Ave Maria_ what are we waiting	 146.87339115122265
for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown	 316.383478683271
part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was	 352.41021172026456
always raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his	 145.50114741122968
mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a	 170.4224432250998
place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him	 227.6110063421479
about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there	 553.2071776371012
and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it	 164.17023851470097
or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an	 1508.561991018275
idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got	 298.20056539863316
me so cheap as he did he was 10 times worse himself anyhow begging me	 410.68694964155856
to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming	 141.6402481284469
along Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had	 87.2762679710871
to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape	 103.09449538686613
of my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me	 80.40057296644939
when I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject	 136.67396803073714
of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced	 75.94510135921774
things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels	 50.96137090216367
even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one	 170.06917021267645
in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see	 192.5683493756483
every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain	 248.4156809480562
I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the	 88.24014487709661
Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the	 43.8519744111152
Zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking	 151.15809373803967
slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they	 371.5409428701668
can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on	 358.566942785869
it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were	 152.43604691646556
you where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me	 87.22825922684423
his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it	 65.53066475575649
was getting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he	 161.08504745050033
pestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he	 106.99540136739905
said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an	 181.26799014985846
excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time	 343.3828751794383
till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his	 444.1584332080082
waistcoat pocket _O Maria Santisima_ he did look a big fool dreeping in	 191.53946598251028
the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them	 258.55524049885776
and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the	 167.40889847195564
sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet	 76.19422065145041
if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you	 59.93088582434947
never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it	 85.00497725170133
if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers	 248.93643211800492
outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him	 146.3889294989644
from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he	 482.85578388980997
circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do	 50.47095547366667
everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting	 358.9852424657654
all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the	 68.49004284867797
butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me	 64.45624057775032
that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to	 177.705844026284
any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we	 1104.5759212166463
met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw	 269.5168034092138
I wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was	 108.57097193664978
always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky	 96.2376911907282
man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake	 265.7842331844052
dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it	 160.92130811042108
used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in	 73.87804511071297
Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children	 943.7752912728744
seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice	 996.2961421545351
a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman	 108.11922997856277
when he sent me the 8 big poppies because mine was the 8th then I wrote	 213.26839475757384
the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it	 158.52344628004073
simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to	 147.4458902886618
embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the	 196.4759168851055
same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you	 500.47372002149353

professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in	 75.74271248489728
his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out	 69.77230268199733
you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I	 180.16151377097322
thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches	 104.20743019793078
first and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was	 130.63631900227767
trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he	 52.378826004275396
must have been a bit late because it was 1/4 after 3 when I saw the 2	 90.78518415929358
Dedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch	 389.2513236314615

at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new	 227.73496429846736
bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next	 83.91904750423315
room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the	 274.3658338450966
wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all	 417.1299873520074

gentlemen in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was	 63.83531646895873

good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd	 101.436818887206

dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their	 189.6077199617941
fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love	 221.39243499976806
to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish	 85.50911757912128
cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from	 227.73693850607532

up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like	 106.93200147739668

round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave	 255.87686299216924
this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the	 339.1465141979681
knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or	 435.0784939571204
tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go	 580.2704146927877
and smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money	 149.43989046212627
and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I	 60.3532158823207
could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when	 85.65322925561266
I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the	 167.93307668960955
expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with	 113.4325992270307
his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat	 248.6418669557619
always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from	 201.55244700307813
behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the	 329.9226932180732
dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so	 204.23480549127635
quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the	 179.07751798766972
way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish	 406.94207587995334
tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly	 625.9013161539532
welloff I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he	 278.9695392326345
was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the	 107.21606747852633
stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost 20	 192.40728823881446
quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for	 166.30028379108484
me on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that	 93.67859726304272
sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming	 176.1795378576167
back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor	 88.54747246885069
looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first	 421.0652405152948
noticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I	 331.2467420116582
wished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my	 71.05203157446027
fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for	 278.61235427071176
I didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers	 112.06721696680887
were hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have	 172.50179734739552
slipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always	 102.47051494288604
hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down	 110.11759246440822
your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a	 168.8926411679858
great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case	 132.9004765792464
if its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one	 283.6283388026159
thing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I	 170.8189796721607
think didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them	 562.8330540003732
either naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she	 213.56705034615766
didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of	 261.69204396220294
silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought	 312.4000925263113
them back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one	 171.94762322583892
change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into	 238.64275110756714
him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id	 23.947954828167138
want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips	 93.78423260882468
he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a	 111.04680157830595
delightful figure line 11/6 obviating that unsightly broad appearance	 572.0110606923964
across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill	 482.8852170504055
have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it	 707.6205991742386
the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his	 217.56100324208322
money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a	 220.3261891231335
cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret	 773.2971436547675

skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger	 172.46548510366372
after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry	 114.2406135453567

to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham	 97.63656021572278
street 1st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it	 382.2171806836534
as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the	 137.0338729346892
day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of	 120.22742703121955

knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and	 242.61378116403677
the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing	 220.7544723205308

Francois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her	 51.50022187947739
ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and	 421.8837109511861
her a—e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that	 320.78940820119146
pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody	 103.46717081925823
can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that	 569.8070645331234
twice I remember when I came to page 50 the part about where she hangs	 702.1515092386003
him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a	 81.76310478248054
woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out	 143.86986470390931
of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the	 179.65358089699106
crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have	 212.5593432828177
a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of	 172.43007004247784
her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and	 277.35385971348666
she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar	 298.52878642215336
the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted	 81.52098214983492
the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me	 68.34522342301021
too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to	 97.1065987838616
chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it	 68.25601878578969
and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank	 548.2717386178922
where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day	 101.34842786616574
of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with	 54.25162180372414
him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe	 970.9801833281961
like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching	 48.20643863898382
about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still	 95.23123628202045
only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could	 105.01031997055573
have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada	 44.13961115158117
once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly	 467.0015049083432
Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I	 280.65237474698944
lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming	 182.2374263380029
into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no	 237.7072508781841
good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as	 118.78456785850803

of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me	 416.4515289598359
altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and	 138.58107678485612
cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I	 69.12299539393275
went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes	 304.7599007784871
take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles	 142.81564227100037
off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my	 87.82692692654584
backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in	 57.37901311454685
Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as	 105.44057997953293
insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were	 216.82650058550763
giving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of	 165.32924786090695
her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second	 211.50858540408444
time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see	 397.74898794997307
him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for	 166.5076666054316
me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs	 163.888843233489
Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him	 249.53831833344
being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled	 214.7096981444937
I know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely	 81.6684584923118
sorry and Im sure you were	 209.06283992826383
yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he	 96.33453020022293
made me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one	 116.43590253336048
anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep	 923.6375268563575
that up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out	 266.21584222796173
for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made 2	 535.7741522166465
the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up	 250.10445468405706
there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide	 224.57522483240783
it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a	 173.84198567524885
man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down	 252.02877601111732
out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it	 96.56956892072118
with a cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat	 35.453818672625395
market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the	 317.8793871388046
statue of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was	 99.62042183067076
pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one	 60.635029472423454
side the Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved	 217.22177891627894

try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was 1 of the 7	 114.8839003616674
wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night	 38.10836617605249

afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the	 415.5397699534281
woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for	 83.58919992604396
a picture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the	 302.66806599119417
job in Helys and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee	 173.87132279775582

and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some	 387.3193494355185
jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply	 208.47556811175485
the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of	 235.84518850438795
the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his	 171.9691280034048
teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent	 89.33476003512675
they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly	 218.62146015009196
enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a	 54.30554216358447
pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate	 486.42262272514506
looking student that stopped in no 28 with the Citrons Penrose nearly	 616.4413078387976

than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond	 464.25873244469
everything I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only	 117.34309125503279

frightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever	 48.29561130584065

even if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but I was	 138.87247432400068
afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once	 758.1680373034203
took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered	 475.1018931964646
with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of	 133.13701001020775

opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because I	 470.5754394150394
had a skirt opening up the side I tormented the life out of him first	 191.07224389832453
tickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt	 161.105321978936
awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the	 271.52789096363307
same I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little when I got	 102.82545385903006
over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back	 122.79704975463213
the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men down the	 222.04717888074327

mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the Lord knows	 118.24660970855219
after the lovely one she had Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along	 143.79597467481875
Williss road to Europa point twisting in and out all round the other	 112.96477964233895
side of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like	 417.06284559101425
Millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down	 447.97495017866237

like a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking of him on the	 426.18910482669776
sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at	 560.2439722692733
the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow	 1408.3342528236205
for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that	 131.61654782323922
Gibraltar only that cheap peau dEspagne that faded and left a stink on	 623.7426520474635

Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they	 285.16443793465703
were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it	 118.1843123110537
like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure 18 carrot gold	 123.35237265451737
because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that	 100.16963404067438

Monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the	 1307.7532500034645
seaside but Id never again in this life get into a boat with him after	 399.21113122505113
him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked	 403.31728272285386
could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it	 136.7192051904698

down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the	 375.3116244964205
tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping	 84.2833970398086

flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before all	 102.04545973509029
the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was	 159.93837879484786
black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed	 119.97177126772533
chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City	 365.3115864098607
Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he	 715.7614359461209
wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was	 139.3167305974685
no love lost between us thats 1 consolation I wonder what kind is that	 184.8084323571474
book he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other	 349.99166498628733
Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with	 155.81546234148664
his tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white	 235.79477998954746
shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather	 241.80151893545025
all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell	 184.2855103739893
of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan	 30.674179080312044
bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the	 205.36186404842022
fishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa	 155.99852224193333
and the tall old chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to	 65.49381787529828
climb up to to get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago	 174.2655829912221
besides I dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at	 275.58282760432166
night I suppose Ill have to put up with it I never brought a bit of	 213.29850029510675
salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was	 265.5736208396385
going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or	 60.519302379270144
Blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the	 98.88926878000673
way his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father he	 194.99389657473046
was going to do and me but I saw through him telling me all the lovely	 127.207854774407
places we could go for the honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the	 105.04034379370961
gondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out of some paper of	 45.9669055830674
and mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I liked he was	 162.109815824926
going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry	 133.82792848405504
my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the	 65.00083162434142
plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old	 167.86643426862207
beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and	 352.6784340373221
put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of	 67.00521103032577
that hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news 20 years in	 169.63910043949545
jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine	 108.50511196045147
his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles	 260.95702238511006
away from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows	 641.6860913337665
to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a	 970.9819857675246
madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute	 502.43514125035847
like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed	 80.67790704029011
Id cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better	 199.85327990932754
than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and	 108.9622601983565
he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was	 37.18606626515274
looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits	 66.68144072096642
making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit	 199.51974912531628
there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling	 754.4998803320148
especially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl	 290.28888167099956
down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather	 78.02649192664063
instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not	 618.8641359025873
like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the	 183.89800680378315
same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way	 143.22641501101694
he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the	 108.39609592028697
place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming	 401.32813802475664
in without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as	 720.7190524865215
I was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then	 349.1157084785514
doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to	 83.6294315665747
look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack	 68.7115784307267
statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got	 141.5173636281792
that little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for 2	 319.3634781054851
shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right	 117.58390762666653
not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at	 143.06759285250538
the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to	 57.58156282512572
understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant	 85.2896335139024
say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and	 257.45730111536125
helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its	 263.7148166167922
me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on	 1070.0290794575187
the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now	 228.73161518636013

whistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly	 1621.545903616953
come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her	 147.46497849473005
round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well	 762.4868565546884
he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to	 57.156930731749114
go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I	 154.5914668108252
smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I	 70.35559790362773
sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I	 158.451392741859
tell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a	 109.40620037896139
parting and the last plumpudding too split in 2 halves see it comes out	 171.9626657938826
no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your	 210.6754430711849
blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle	 855.0670841264256
blackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on	 128.28614465572383
show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at	 140.10129359054227
her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you	 208.82814047874416
then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the	 84.38715118915405
Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me	 1085.0023913655264
afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that	 42.93234176557799
touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always	 66.49244802120201
trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for	 32.085224146420764
Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed	 204.65618460414265
like that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me	 126.59969475263165
there and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to	 83.12036039549524
get near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same	 298.2920560603404
little game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but	 236.38022129047457
he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the	 173.63996224762644
Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance	 763.6486483365335
on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands	 55.45056507084505
swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything	 191.60859872100968
deep yet I never came properly till I was what 22 or so it went into	 330.2040623156691
the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that	 286.1471673051064
Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with	 171.60485502499094
sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he	 169.67568427369832
looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and	 1278.0639653525955
supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man	 223.09919953746999
gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a	 138.22094180847492
few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it	 401.05590309224925
really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love	 110.78636078572248
in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each	 162.7360447610899
other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit	 107.30761781618611
foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and	 87.71727478544678
poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes	 224.03832674633804
always making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to	 248.64156445078166
put her hair up at 15 my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time	 173.29192587439618
enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes	 227.90468124191787
pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too	 471.0939763228811
but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a	 120.36362042074124
fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we	 59.1516474277353
met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to	 469.7358747810663
see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough	 402.44149781529717
till I gave her 2 damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that	 319.38447289389495
now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me	 89.5441011664974
that exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because	 46.14139907118017
how was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night	 70.94493074098672
before cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to	 282.9217295294715
leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as	 187.33740785434276
she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was	 142.1797875200643
the last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself	 40.61182423182816
they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the	 470.39848474729115
two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever	 232.24566140294417
going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming	 708.761811510962
Id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that	 117.54466277422816
old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the	 157.3959837838515
things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course	 81.73415657595548
shes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly	 101.20816120460836

jingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the	 109.5350566995166
other side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor	 41.84939181555962
with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think	 87.42788250739636

after that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I	 129.83552926623307
made him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse	 125.96034979598241
and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be	 83.15543302172736

Dr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called	 70.07519429234682

old face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and	 107.05692058614837
could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the	 148.8830657417049
rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by	 93.29290248236845
the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I	 228.72557026230677
can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and	 1356.7342041730296
needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by	 88.79545158010377
Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the	 88.26809501935945
same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and	 151.5361412652333

the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked	 135.5318166177948
sideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows	 184.5044765517292
what else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out	 147.8040237615078
frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you	 152.89509186912738
lying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever	 2207.298516094901
enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad	 330.2501629738892
crazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious	 326.449194720226
Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and	 192.87657807115954
of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he	 129.54375715937869
had me always at myself 4 and 5 times a day sometimes and I said I	 506.9434100236562
hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him	 75.35920135681968
up I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited	 215.80332765915583
me I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in	 120.2735317404084
Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about 10 minutes	 954.3063163356652
as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking	 253.08376882950637
after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half	 76.83280795338457
sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand	 53.42768090342312
for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his	 316.6834308594408
blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool	 267.23274060737526
of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O	 129.56488593663516
beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and	 334.89976678125635
rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy	 105.20558735046234
anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very 1st	 388.6225744740912
opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom	 93.32707905684818
pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk	 176.10683214415164
and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I	 110.7438874604282
laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight	 327.5220210563038
sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so	 262.710153966424
that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose	 91.32473392581089
there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at	 144.46529568332872
the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard	 188.2170672724624
bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth	 423.0405427824881
breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to	 82.52919780498614
show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a	 501.75473476860407
pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out	 97.60775058440181
that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put	 986.7888789250378
together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody	 253.33033471159612
I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big	 82.4690112344684
square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway	 343.17293670069927

creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere	 281.2326825970038
still she must have given him great value for his money of course he	 199.5471731150679
has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll	 129.9545696331697
have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God	 195.29071011414766
help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always	 269.5918601870527
reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often	 78.68159174106613
enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to	 376.1672378965544
admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like	 165.3941281760486
my bed God here we are as bad as ever after 16 years how many houses	 454.8387850876866

the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the	 84.76560074339254
men with our 4 sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse	 181.31141949725912
and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always	 317.7666387853429
somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always	 644.5268714102722

something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr	 133.2792385031859
Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old	 126.02994042209959
lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives	 80.6207726986958
impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the	 253.12363950785172
Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the	 199.39938249712793
freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along	 140.66262492511902
in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much	 299.3349793094739
consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed	 106.97726191000817
judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres	 57.933826078581276
Georges church bells wait 3 quarters the hour wait two oclock well	 619.6579800455966

little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if	 671.7020512735812

dont know deceitful men all their 20 pockets arent enough for their	 304.726742252848
lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont	 464.5790705703667

used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast	 1614.7334031481796
or speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough	 155.93344835107132
for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his	 211.7275340877978
own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that	 204.4380543934173

got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look	 304.3113554411842
young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and	 135.21872161324052
me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge	 78.73101987525565
station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats 11 years ago	 134.6903229885915

what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for	 318.2624071346899
me I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted	 40.49622321069558
hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time	 149.43760200968447
he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord	 255.486323621622
Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw	 101.45775889936233
him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God	 220.25107589178864
yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out	 118.74316019900067
the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met	 903.357164536488
before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either	 229.5484596012782
besides my face was turned the other way what was the 7th card after	 262.8242077742269
that the 10 of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on	 143.17780627984837

in society yes wait it all came out and 2 red 8s for new garments look	 1000.2842104454463
at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about	 181.2974267417282
poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or	 306.47446495778263
standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only	 91.23021650468861
getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry	 3909.08534501812
when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not	 75.47753265792304
an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I	 85.24481478144473
wonder is he too young hes about wait 88 I was married 88 Milly is 15	 339.7893083926022
yesterday 89 what age was he then at Dillons 5 or 6 about 88 I suppose	 657.0679584843695
hes 20 or more Im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 I hope hes not	 243.41320879711492
that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting	 2499.4099662278586
down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of	 149.97571008417432
course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was	 104.10518508838261
out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not	 306.20031120755027
a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson	 163.7042074665032
they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont	 189.68328824073788
find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where	 532.8728898978115
poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully	 181.75543805852917
coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point	 61.974807764026366
the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back	 176.1538792273467
there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that	 1685.9623253227248
for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly	 184.4798908469143
bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young	 2691.977724105574
star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to	 252.67730502973083
talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts	 219.17247557304808
ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in	 782.9438657908894
their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like	 353.75508197201844
to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young	 246.54409448806877
those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace	 183.41725760179747
from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or	 150.7251975714549
something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men	 81.44545732080896
like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely	 71.64932127605809
little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and	 281.83111458084767
his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and	 256.00716757091715
poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his	 167.89442737036708
lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth	 443.8230940059143
if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and	 286.9347856389193
white he looks with his boyish face I would too in 1/2 a minute even if	 228.2982078231591
some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no	 150.7952754474431
danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I	 345.9445120131893
suppose never dream of washing it from 1 years end to the other the	 935.9958196414742
most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure	 154.7985097871247
itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age	 328.4468529695387
Ill throw them the 1st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard	 86.00558620864358
comes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out	 315.6291918251733
Ill read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew	 294.31295495206825
who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the	 807.9506834760871
same and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him	 374.24932652265886
till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and	 1287.141924897014
mistress publicly too with our 2 photographs in all the papers when he	 199.54816881533657
becomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though	 313.59823732796326
no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no	 168.6577022938513
nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because	 316.71770462416805
I didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a	 356.10800460504936
cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place	 172.83858213856507
pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so	 231.43889583799418
barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar	 333.12648085044054
way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a	 205.7879728066419
butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course	 76.16720619017632
hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might	 161.59039494601024
as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something	 200.77311818401492
better to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its	 110.6656403570454
because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he	 403.62273206023826
couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the	 156.04575797372414
amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white	 245.80646580405778
for them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try with	 247.16432132901176
that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so	 209.6032560479432
soft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those	 372.11942935959786
cornerboys saying passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has	 225.89607938815476
a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it	 103.59540157204881
didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts	 424.25521077896246
his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be	 168.5146476870015
you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick	 216.28941854836853
and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl	 308.0702880000593
for their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street	 3832.1722370362836
no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me	 101.12805182448258
up no damn fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands	 593.9769864501247
jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling	 165.34284554987113
her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if	 245.2597041708051
he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he	 108.34092786534194
going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course	 140.30321939796607
the man never even casts a 2nd thought on the husband or wife either	 418.2670547453171
its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all	 360.3349117902168
those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can	 214.3909995986825
I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with	 528.5930193732573
him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the	 1204.3386908038158
wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a	 401.2378502972533
womans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything	 350.0938289593757

dirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita	 542.5971308189816
theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a	 162.31900697674385
madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a	 472.3729712652726
woman wants to be embraced 20 times a day almost to make her look young	 337.36042272105595
no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the	 289.64835607472827
fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking	 151.02536234077655
would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd	 192.40327485917166
know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not	 251.89452838084912
care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of	 205.90558853817612
those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near	 48.47815219262784
the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only	 110.6115025772275
sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back	 657.7123156172518
over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow	 439.15146176070783
with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me	 78.96544868811152
up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do	 147.44797312025062
themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up	 682.748908389681
somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us	 102.38518356298036
the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course	 188.08975953207886
it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and	 61.57951973002247
when I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after	 138.58407055303547
coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his	 85.48214275975766
wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten	 91.7062274178269
again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the	 627.4553531111522
love of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well	 67.77926889139486
he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he	 187.62290614445095
knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to	 76.30268719752007
sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between 2 7s too in prison for	 279.4673279810283
Lord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around	 48.35417561128741
down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled	 233.91824123146216
up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like	 197.46771658690756
to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I	 349.0844386670249
dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be	 319.9542054478085
governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one	 130.23846812553012
another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around	 416.2012286785871
drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on	 220.19187062055306
horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop	 464.9462486856049
sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know	 130.7178816689713
what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they	 147.13397253446246
all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I	 143.25454479470068
never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away	 510.59855240910053
from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the	 72.99138293281959
usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a	 520.2412632196664
fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to	 247.69875530926834
make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two	 255.1760670671282
dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that	 125.18312908824845
disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in	 66.34594446935483
that little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some	 177.95735056925153
poor child but I knew well Id never have another our 1st death too it	 365.92495840488215

the glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I	 82.06897330765726
felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of	 299.93541653056815
roving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and	 263.22244435829793
pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining	 84.85042900449896
himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to	 605.0461217504402
love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends	 142.4724569033322

that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I	 113.2302461466677

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without	 242.04746476053205
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of	 134.82575262057372
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be	 245.78184000376982
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest	 13.28204499364989
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations	 61.9295706584755
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt	 113.89871101445891
status with the IRS.	 8.648317163517822
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating	 11.498062867798861
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United	 27.714379835861774
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a	 114.15042639824094
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up	 296.70344641120266
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations	 47.386797127406744
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND	 169.39239323792577

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we	 191.13667704416
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition	 126.21308013322634
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who	 41.80087815458515
approach us with offers to donate.	 2430.9439359851863
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make	 194.5543643448235
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from	 31.57084939507306
