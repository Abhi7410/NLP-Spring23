Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of	 33.72476058004817
lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow	 135.2444493817363
dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild	 63.98702140173414
morning air. He held the bowl aloft and intoned:	 65.21836523269472
—_Introibo ad altare Dei_.	 19.152685023280444
Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:	 106.35114527985742
—Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!	 106.78098881882323
Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about	 53.36086510931316
and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the	 61.77027904940795
awaking mountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent	 158.06012337077334
towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat	 35.081356677700846
and shaking his head. Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned	 142.7277919612907
his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking	 50.929810424185824
gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light	 57.165855440735
untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.	 34.051731322642404
Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the	 34.61805136343272
bowl smartly.	 219.71847567252402
—Back to barracks! he said sternly.	 70.8141443795022
He added in a preacher’s tone:	 43.198782589978165
—For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul	 67.72899236164861
and blood and ouns. Slow music, please. Shut your eyes, gents. One	 138.6130081192449
moment. A little trouble about those white corpuscles. Silence, all.	 209.80212974958025
He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused	 78.12942122290474
awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and	 183.494004504424
there with gold points. Chrysostomos. Two strong shrill whistles	 84.12626618174468
answered through the calm.	 405.6995565905686
—Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. That will do nicely. Switch off	 39.68710631788616
the current, will you?	 27.026910603444037
He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering	 37.38150415904931
about his legs the loose folds of his gown. The plump shadowed face and	 67.45092342104901
sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.	 26.833457904376942
A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.	 72.41301637202909
—The mockery of it! he said gaily. Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!	 67.6046432440981
He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet,	 45.77849878777121
laughing to himself. Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily	 94.69628836406137
halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as	 26.964022404666192
he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and	 55.475404746035665
lathered cheeks and neck.	 134.75403669966155
Buck Mulligan’s gay voice went on.	 38.72799419849144
—My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it has a	 49.89693535886565
Hellenic ring, hasn’t it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself. We	 125.94986637010128
must go to Athens. Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out	 64.77925972189405
twenty quid?	 275.9865207680744
He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:	 78.90870773125792
—Will he come? The jejune jesuit!	 133.9247811071541
Ceasing, he began to shave with care.	 21.22125245240435
—Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.	 73.48217933977843
—Yes, my love?	 160.30009823849238
—How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?	 163.2047120345713
Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.	 51.477794338639384
—God, isn’t he dreadful? he said frankly. A ponderous Saxon. He thinks	 81.62422657929217
you’re not a gentleman. God, these bloody English! Bursting with money	 96.04784740523966
and indigestion. Because he comes from Oxford. You know, Dedalus, you	 150.78580325099037
have the real Oxford manner. He can’t make you out. O, my name for you	 84.9411974790191
is the best: Kinch, the knife-blade.	 32.79635631257703
He shaved warily over his chin.	 46.992042019295724
—He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said. Where is	 37.113069007493166
his guncase?	 21.605641423575047
—A woful lunatic! Mulligan said. Were you in a funk?	 42.40902951692929
—I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear. Out here in the dark	 55.30523674311501
with a man I don’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a	 39.02647054743095
black panther. You saved men from drowning. I’m not a hero, however. If	 100.91452533794796
he stays on here I am off.	 167.0059094484239
Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. He hopped down	 16.715220830897383
from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.	 28.14410583521098
—Scutter! he cried thickly.	 25.847607130079137
He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen’s upper	 25.450347410557317
pocket, said:	 2505.957090619599
—Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.	 32.66291734250577
Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a	 76.92553751903554
dirty crumpled handkerchief. Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.	 60.42886333668008
Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:	 60.67742279139995
—The bard’s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.	 50.00690933560197
You can almost taste it, can’t you?	 22.110420190970412
He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair	 62.12513962470387
oakpale hair stirring slightly.	 139.49093230112115
—God! he said quietly. Isn’t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet	 82.17104651275524
mother? The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea. _Epi oinopa	 48.89219441672124
ponton_. Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you. You must read them	 87.71164902351184
in the original. _Thalatta! Thalatta!_ She is our great sweet mother.	 45.36978347200577
Come and look.	 279.33250665384935
Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet. Leaning on it he looked	 34.34565832161755
down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of	 18.283340978750015
Kingstown.	 7921.454895547122
—Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.	 26.805847144731793
He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen’s	 51.87680065723041
face.	 2013.3117700297628
—The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. That’s why she won’t	 26.033321609565117
let me have anything to do with you.	 49.6308605868147
—Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.	 69.40113528723951
—You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother	 101.4947670736244
asked you, Buck Mulligan said. I’m hyperborean as much as you. But to	 50.49209846846858
think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and	 75.86481145370595
pray for her. And you refused. There is something sinister in you....	 73.91844855685552
He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. A tolerant	 44.693695661941206
smile curled his lips.	 130.6104620076929
—But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself. Kinch, the loveliest	 69.6408250545487
mummer of them all!	 21.63706280776068
He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.	 67.55396434823889
Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against	 42.679033612522424
his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve.	 33.951599216446155
Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart. Silently,	 91.65686906048272
in a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within	 56.066125950793435
its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood,	 63.04030851519602
her breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of	 35.09357445075821
wetted ashes. Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a	 28.83672652219148
great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him. The ring of bay and	 75.5265517074923
skyline held a dull green mass of liquid. A bowl of white china had	 76.45433396751598
stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had	 37.09013456191491
torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.	 48.61346294510017
Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.	 25.752393429406254
—Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice. I must give you a shirt	 68.33093251665834
and a few noserags. How are the secondhand breeks?	 33.774277093982185
—They fit well enough, Stephen answered.	 88.37600409328091
Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.	 25.345640778731713
—The mockery of it, he said contentedly. Secondleg they should be. God	 39.70484236717816
knows what poxy bowsy left them off. I have a lovely pair with a hair	 89.18272937654535
stripe, grey. You’ll look spiffing in them. I’m not joking, Kinch. You	 122.37910935639667
look damn well when you’re dressed.	 153.36048185053235
—Thanks, Stephen said. I can’t wear them if they are grey.	 51.104362874749796
—He can’t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.	 33.28875666749331
Etiquette is etiquette. He kills his mother but he can’t wear grey	 65.70783200523535
trousers.	 4091.603844469761
He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the	 73.48710746194745
smooth skin.	 1441.0929666770787
Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its	 58.32641027863868
smokeblue mobile eyes.	 24.88703675184071
—That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan,	 72.04345826062156
says you have g. p. i. He’s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman.	 135.54227582814826
General paralysis of the insane!	 19.854379492240483
He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings	 54.33781189555966
abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea. His curling shaven lips	 73.44020970412548
laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth. Laughter seized	 42.271707257229814
all his strong wellknit trunk.	 184.79168577596903
—Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!	 93.23704037180603
Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by	 41.833548227464334
a crooked crack. Hair on end. As he and others see me. Who chose this	 126.24721376717122
face for me? This dogsbody to rid of vermin. It asks me too.	 58.15776912976522
—I pinched it out of the skivvy’s room, Buck Mulligan said. It does her	 30.34894353277096
all right. The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi.	 177.4447978198119
Lead him not into temptation. And her name is Ursula.	 87.51563743166697
Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen’s peering eyes.	 167.9756451480369
—The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said. If	 43.48721038867027
Wilde were only alive to see you!	 126.38174608603629
Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:	 83.0679861179171
—It is a symbol of Irish art. The cracked lookingglass of a servant.	 29.089566275661785
Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen’s and walked with him	 64.81357439852341
round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he	 57.92923559959445
had thrust them.	 125.67367493428893
—It’s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? he said kindly.	 60.92811214270025
God knows you have more spirit than any of them.	 146.39656323451354
Parried again. He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his. The	 42.49212395782795
cold steel pen.	 193.29750847367274
—Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap	 92.41989962909884
downstairs and touch him for a guinea. He’s stinking with money and	 85.25298796285234
thinks you’re not a gentleman. His old fellow made his tin by selling	 155.14855559871404
jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other. God, Kinch, if you and	 47.25457790032491
I could only work together we might do something for the island.	 73.5936147949281
Hellenise it.	 31.839927380285154
Cranly’s arm. His arm.	 166.29817831368808
—And to think of your having to beg from these swine. I’m the only one	 103.09651420012487
that knows what you are. Why don’t you trust me more? What have you up	 51.537469918654025
your nose against me? Is it Haines? If he makes any noise here I’ll	 133.16085589054816
bring down Seymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave	 87.51987348031491
Clive Kempthorpe.	 4.411654744205047
Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe’s rooms. Palefaces:	 64.02850697777961
they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another. O, I shall	 186.0469583294512
expire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit	 67.27749243332092
ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the	 22.849057785003343
table, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the	 60.352202914306396
tailor’s shears. A scared calf’s face gilded with marmalade. I don’t	 71.45723804848537
want to be debagged! Don’t you play the giddy ox with me!	 40.03869094516534
Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle. A deaf	 96.73335473365395
gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold’s face, pushes his mower	 10.703391181489366
on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.	 39.34268871420338
To ourselves... new paganism... omphalos.	 91.14589345489976
—Let him stay, Stephen said. There’s nothing wrong with him except at	 40.911456692142195
night.	 1392.3265998404243
—Then what is it? Buck Mulligan asked impatiently. Cough it up. I’m	 51.842538242295014
quite frank with you. What have you against me now?	 123.19869176240977
They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on	 39.23692750305285
the water like the snout of a sleeping whale. Stephen freed his arm	 74.37991765478539
quietly.	 7850.71517635226
—Do you wish me to tell you? he asked.	 34.35580474081385
—Yes, what is it? Buck Mulligan answered. I don’t remember anything.	 22.137300813701593
He looked in Stephen’s face as he spoke. A light wind passed his brow,	 94.6492744480578
fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of	 112.91987830721075
anxiety in his eyes.	 16.142058525495454
Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said:	 44.1436928159223
—Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother’s	 54.45206953350046
death?	 2559.1007722123036
Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:	 31.309253011426897
—What? Where? I can’t remember anything. I remember only ideas and	 55.66219297368607
sensations. Why? What happened in the name of God?	 36.86732046496072
—You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get	 66.40137196203344
more hot water. Your mother and some visitor came out of the	 54.3157324764747
drawingroom. She asked you who was in your room.	 57.14298043217148
—Yes? Buck Mulligan said. What did I say? I forget.	 37.14309113439052
—You said, Stephen answered, _O, it’s only Dedalus whose mother is	 157.31794931416775
beastly dead._	 1864.5785629016668
A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck	 121.5058393472739
Mulligan’s cheek.	 1598.017722727577
—Did I say that? he asked. Well? What harm is that?	 44.61252793148717
He shook his constraint from him nervously.	 44.128218281641026
—And what is death, he asked, your mother’s or yours or my own? You saw	 106.4451074749297
only your mother die. I see them pop off every day in the Mater and	 91.34055052514712
Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. It’s a beastly	 75.58570726199282
thing and nothing else. It simply doesn’t matter. You wouldn’t kneel	 96.6502963633759
down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you. Why?	 57.50118221463131
Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it’s injected	 112.30687614533805
the wrong way. To me it’s all a mockery and beastly. Her cerebral lobes	 77.26639213817063
are not functioning. She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks	 56.84953764285223
buttercups off the quilt. Humour her till it’s over. You crossed her	 133.15157498881777
last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don’t whinge like	 95.6022952280198
some hired mute from Lalouette’s. Absurd! I suppose I did say it. I	 111.96249783159236
didn’t mean to offend the memory of your mother.	 49.85296080258986
He had spoken himself into boldness. Stephen, shielding the gaping	 90.39143857636218
wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:	 83.84404157483388
—I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.	 47.66116507157137
—Of what then? Buck Mulligan asked.	 88.41123610373108
—Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.	 59.740584486758
Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.	 60.50073162115621
—O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.	 118.55936267891761
He walked off quickly round the parapet. Stephen stood at his post,	 101.20624491155907
gazing over the calm sea towards the headland. Sea and headland now	 48.15120856120553
grew dim. Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he	 74.2809887459965
felt the fever of his cheeks.	 204.619931224706
A voice within the tower called loudly:	 136.6565177130208
—Are you up there, Mulligan?	 193.26431888115323
—I’m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.	 49.426783536596865
He turned towards Stephen and said:	 77.76640552936794
—Look at the sea. What does it care about offences? Chuck Loyola,	 29.187713161273685
Kinch, and come on down. The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.	 120.73264626148543
His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level	 34.18568172974988
with the roof:	 14.636642629548161
—Don’t mope over it all day, he said. I’m inconsequent. Give up the	 87.17306960858255
moody brooding.	 4.411654744205047
His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of	 24.780937896257175
the stairhead:	 7.77559996992721
And no more turn aside and brood	 16.053608400204098
Upon love’s bitter mystery	 41.12965362134884
For Fergus rules the brazen cars.	 24.66073298916119
Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the	 88.17639704526802
stairhead seaward where he gazed. Inshore and farther out the mirror of	 35.14690574064994
water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet. White breast of the	 95.95228474846863
dim sea. The twining stresses, two by two. A hand plucking the	 80.13405429387765
harpstrings, merging their twining chords. Wavewhite wedded words	 31.65707236839448
shimmering on the dim tide.	 48.800747092478126
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in	 24.960859566514774
deeper green. It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters. Fergus’	 49.22125431762588
song: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords.	 70.52083210042015
Her door was open: she wanted to hear my music. Silent with awe and	 124.68405006491575
pity I went to her bedside. She was crying in her wretched bed. For	 48.41290464936738
those words, Stephen: love’s bitter mystery.	 70.10047074427843
Where now?	 898.8980735779204
Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk,	 24.48285562849706
a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer. A birdcage hung in the	 16.017026050619005
sunny window of her house when she was a girl. She heard old Royce sing	 90.93388583753801
in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he	 47.915988368963774
sang:	 15318.024569656527
I am the boy	 50.2385609395833
That can enjoy	 204.7007360283341
Invisibility.	 4.608171674364364
Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.	 35.779441219914915
And no more turn aside and brood.	 16.053608400204098
Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys. Memories beset his	 35.69658383861426
brooding brain. Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had	 92.19922612130395
approached the sacrament. A cored apple, filled with brown sugar,	 218.92127668467026
roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening. Her shapely	 52.88090676298146
fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s	 11.235295905336482
shirts.	 5939.610053333298
In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its	 47.14688560437477
loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath,	 63.64476185167361
bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.	 75.2620824875226
Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul. On	 66.6655234480607
me alone. The ghostcandle to light her agony. Ghostly light on the	 75.02094270817261
tortured face. Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all	 191.12241722070706
prayed on their knees. Her eyes on me to strike me down. _Liliata	 79.32973906392303
rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum	 12.746066717511425
chorus excipiat._	 4.411654744205047
Ghoul! Chewer of corpses!	 6.098250790305123
No, mother! Let me be and let me live.	 95.9344922375769
—Kinch ahoy!	 129.86935985977308
Buck Mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower. It came nearer up the	 53.61115731615866
staircase, calling again. Stephen, still trembling at his soul’s cry,	 291.7162107272387
heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.	 151.65230319167097
—Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. Breakfast is ready. Haines is	 133.05480121706148
apologising for waking us last night. It’s all right.	 50.3628635446641
—I’m coming, Stephen said, turning.	 55.380179509148846
—Do, for Jesus’ sake, Buck Mulligan said. For my sake and for all our	 54.83587552175172
sakes.	 4.608171674364364
His head disappeared and reappeared.	 17.322049804942218
—I told him your symbol of Irish art. He says it’s very clever. Touch	 67.4783634643512
him for a quid, will you? A guinea, I mean.	 75.54869937994386
—I get paid this morning, Stephen said.	 59.391396526951745
—The school kip? Buck Mulligan said. How much? Four quid? Lend us one.	 39.65726849229174
—If you want it, Stephen said.	 26.525453694018125
—Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight. We’ll have	 59.53993691203779
a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. Four omnipotent	 45.58136286098849
sovereigns.	 15248.021145030376
He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of	 28.43520382388261
tune with a Cockney accent:	 54.677766845601816
O, won’t we have a merry time,	 55.44558382735622
Drinking whisky, beer and wine!	 349.01538607726405
On coronation,	 59.73674875755915
Coronation day!	 74.9216955639911
O, won’t we have a merry time	 55.44558382735622
On coronation day!	 141.7429953989341
Warm sunshine merrying over the sea. The nickel shavingbowl shone,	 48.646219850590185
forgotten, on the parapet. Why should I bring it down? Or leave it	 89.9590370983832
there all day, forgotten friendship?	 92.68346534851118
He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness,	 38.875663639191934
smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.	 36.71087683535386
So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes. I am another now	 115.84056783042601
and yet the same. A servant too. A server of a servant.	 79.99187143122754
In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan’s gowned form	 36.67900432607732
moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its	 53.183954803979134
yellow glow. Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor	 83.1826559312869
from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of	 69.53611407099551
coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.	 69.40549568321212
—We’ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said. Haines, open that door, will you?	 88.86265112867142
Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. A tall figure rose from the	 38.77315828505902
hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open	 72.26599311866487
the inner doors.	 33.73024896110326
—Have you the key? a voice asked.	 76.00376100430402
—Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said. Janey Mack, I’m choked!	 82.7984935535172
He howled, without looking up from the fire:	 30.49185613943419
—Kinch!	 3952.7300467290793
—It’s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.	 81.8298478305108
The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been	 76.11972063921499
set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered. Haines stood at the	 113.05862744151922
doorway, looking out. Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and	 64.95622191381813
sat down to wait. Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside	 51.27978856260439
him. Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set	 62.50056206260146
them down heavily and sighed with relief.	 122.2298037713679
—I’m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when... But, hush! Not a	 92.67286907577306
word more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey.	 422.9277572819908
Haines, come in. The grub is ready. Bless us, O Lord, and these thy	 111.56266147691485
gifts. Where’s the sugar? O, jay, there’s no milk.	 151.3419045518393
Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from	 39.23552941516347
the locker. Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.	 36.59345708252338
—What sort of a kip is this? he said. I told her to come after eight.	 44.75074834577619
—We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily. There’s a lemon in the	 44.11847980603584
locker.	 17235.812321843623
—O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said. I want Sandycove	 63.14847433147549
milk.	 3359.969314915033
Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:	 75.84613963177485
—That woman is coming up with the milk.	 71.54522652596405
—The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his	 23.746464266825846
chair. Sit down. Pour out the tea there. The sugar is in the bag. Here,	 145.1653596438209
I can’t go fumbling at the damned eggs.	 125.45819924629528
He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three	 28.89685191203472
plates, saying:	 1605.5222629246432
—_In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti._	 14.02951076558796
Haines sat down to pour out the tea.	 45.18015436165939
—I’m giving you two lumps each, he said. But, I say, Mulligan, you do	 78.13687243674728
make strong tea, don’t you?	 213.8701258252564
Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old	 51.953765868751574
woman’s wheedling voice:	 385.49126489069323
—When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. And when I	 45.37656129331388
makes water I makes water.	 98.89046101056755
—By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.	 55.803021442587415
Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:	 20.246413916245096
—_So I do, Mrs Cahill,_ says she. _Begob, ma’am,_ says Mrs Cahill, _God	 93.27170778240765
send you don’t make them in the one pot._	 60.94247370853237
He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled	 33.64088101424271
on his knife.	 136.1837043025002
—That’s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines. Five lines	 97.54909367778365
of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of	 50.86235655707655
Dundrum. Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.	 35.97610473481067
He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his	 35.488625664562576
brows:	 14950.359454455664
—Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan’s tea and water pot spoken	 209.98848107752735
of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?	 25.154030684550932
—I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.	 178.60593767627665
—Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone. Your reasons, pray?	 54.21385264932927
—I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the	 45.946178760734185
Mabinogion. Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.	 29.96689388015522
Buck Mulligan’s face smiled with delight.	 37.90250360130546
—Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth	 66.06245664352309
and blinking his eyes pleasantly. Do you think she was? Quite charming!	 64.05510018160463
Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened	 65.12352790796665
rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:	 47.575552913468684
_—For old Mary Ann	 80.33808662896672
She doesn’t care a damn.	 217.63437215317632
But, hising up her petticoats..._	 162.69448888214166
He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.	 12.263691844139135
The doorway was darkened by an entering form.	 140.10175982315192
—The milk, sir!	 206.84556995761903
—Come in, ma’am, Mulligan said. Kinch, get the jug.	 153.352512389295
An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen’s elbow.	 40.30901457128684
—That’s a lovely morning, sir, she said. Glory be to God.	 58.14595799203141
—To whom? Mulligan said, glancing at her. Ah, to be sure!	 54.40085919244296
Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.	 44.88012950841406
—The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of	 68.38277351556654
the collector of prepuces.	 6.165730712213736
—How much, sir? asked the old woman.	 53.32752065342606
—A quart, Stephen said.	 42.676346504661694
He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white	 52.01825650570469
milk, not hers. Old shrunken paps. She poured again a measureful and a	 56.608543847514035
tilly. Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a	 146.83548149794504
messenger. She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.	 64.8032659707623
Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on	 45.6929127674952
her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs. They	 36.84982075639452
lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle. Silk of the kine and	 56.65696360596172
poor old woman, names given her in old times. A wandering crone, lowly	 81.29535804893766
form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their	 69.20661925916805
common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning. To serve or to	 151.73063606997303
upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.	 83.62654342560023
—It is indeed, ma’am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.	 57.20580555555299
—Taste it, sir, she said.	 167.55151823863903
He drank at her bidding.	 68.63699014852477
—If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat	 63.48429893811846
loudly, we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten	 87.37925891525761
guts. Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved	 111.807571864448
with dust, horsedung and consumptives’ spits.	 20.16893268685571
—Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked.	 43.66951601525647
—I am, ma’am, Buck Mulligan answered.	 16.348798528441172
—Look at that now, she said.	 55.89459945637255
Stephen listened in scornful silence. She bows her old head to a voice	 96.19517604278224
that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she	 73.9448306680303
slights. To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there	 65.8041519075245
is of her but her woman’s unclean loins, of man’s flesh made not in	 144.63461890336768
God’s likeness, the serpent’s prey. And to the loud voice that now bids	 96.53416574986353
her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.	 91.25077640580255
—Do you understand what he says? Stephen asked her.	 54.08593221543106
—Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines.	 60.39633413346038
Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.	 52.581805543383034
—Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Is there Gaelic on you?	 56.10337861509884
—I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it. Are you from the	 43.2918241463993
west, sir?	 1864.654133439502
—I am an Englishman, Haines answered.	 48.52615559977519
—He’s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak	 30.709540786223766
Irish in Ireland.	 505.31913192232525
—Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I’m ashamed I don’t speak	 58.71845829692014
the language myself. I’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows.	 128.1004829573764
—Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan. Wonderful entirely. Fill	 131.85387824185133
us out some more tea, Kinch. Would you like a cup, ma’am?	 65.76556019102499
—No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the	 22.729467350645162
milkcan on her forearm and about to go.	 44.60820548785517
Haines said to her:	 54.19144699751108
—Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn’t we?	 97.41159196117349
Stephen filled again the three cups.	 40.5203518596325
—Bill, sir? she said, halting. Well, it’s seven mornings a pint at	 71.50502751628757
twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three	 142.20331607298127
mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. That’s a	 76.4917130791884
shilling and one and two is two and two, sir.	 218.99408630302472
Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly	 19.95093585190632
buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search	 53.39806037449229
his trouser pockets.	 61.757871697861695
—Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.	 144.41410807481196
Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the	 85.07640036004996
thick rich milk. Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in	 89.18464769964025
his fingers and cried:	 124.87682653329526
—A miracle!	 13.400948507362273
He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:	 45.26373912623737
—Ask nothing more of me, sweet. All I can give you I give.	 104.62227863209161
Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.	 90.17143699550599
—We’ll owe twopence, he said.	 20.986249618077164
—Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. Time enough. Good	 75.30685971500694
morning, sir.	 69.80850839457214
She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan’s tender chant:	 76.69772265718741
_—Heart of my heart, were it more,	 165.092717212064
More would be laid at your feet._	 110.73946738865891
He turned to Stephen and said:	 36.38957211446847
—Seriously, Dedalus. I’m stony. Hurry out to your school kip and bring	 157.65785737302403
us back some money. Today the bards must drink and junket. Ireland	 103.83686141809693
expects that every man this day will do his duty.	 89.51032439182389
—That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your	 46.43888798332819
national library today.	 137.42855671737985
—Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.	 36.35996407063967
He turned to Stephen and asked blandly:	 46.164085692983804
—Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?	 155.2654454384257
Then he said to Haines:	 52.557582868272036
—The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.	 133.50681349226616
—All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey	 35.454209748890044
trickle over a slice of the loaf.	 30.265731339890387
Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the	 98.2253774081883
loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:	 74.48722843803408
—I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.	 23.017843317915485
Speaking to me. They wash and tub and scrub. Agenbite of inwit.	 51.546456440911854
Conscience. Yet here’s a spot.	 249.39251889504501
—That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol	 78.65131427293417
of Irish art is deuced good.	 65.03814453942832
Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen’s foot under the table and said with	 22.48008559042999
warmth of tone:	 278.1301891320506
—Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.	 45.14725884586318
—Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen. I was just	 67.11283989249507
thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.	 106.52381601710381
—Would I make any money by it? Stephen asked.	 110.58020347390284
Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of	 32.45384500645877
the hammock, said:	 39.87459998411135
—I don’t know, I’m sure.	 26.187939657975477
He strolled out to the doorway. Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen	 26.1137411106622
and said with coarse vigour:	 29.401030543409373
—You put your hoof in it now. What did you say that for?	 53.095534874228385
—Well? Stephen said. The problem is to get money. From whom? From the	 75.28981539814443
milkwoman or from him. It’s a toss up, I think.	 56.65295401007157
—I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along	 61.02145798223657
with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.	 43.60828839872556
—I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.	 130.17701917197022
Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen’s arm.	 38.23811390878085
—From me, Kinch, he said.	 59.34863945327707
In a suddenly changed tone he added:	 339.4636773314094
—To tell you the God’s truth I think you’re right. Damn all else they	 58.980510477105014
are good for. Why don’t you play them as I do? To hell with them all.	 74.4206486953047
Let us get out of the kip.	 41.448162287243626
He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying	 30.907434926935867
resignedly:	 4.608171674364364
—Mulligan is stripped of his garments.	 75.49716690488619
He emptied his pockets on to the table.	 23.272414517066355
—There’s your snotrag, he said.	 42.650577926436796
And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them,	 66.7400019608284
chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. His hands plunged and	 42.23125167291338
rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. God,	 75.71795864831107
we’ll simply have to dress the character. I want puce gloves and green	 161.7356610313461
boots. Contradiction. Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I	 129.33912245834654
contradict myself. Mercurial Malachi. A limp black missile flew out of	 107.10203394622349
his talking hands.	 338.7117774433214
—And there’s your Latin quarter hat, he said.	 30.936170743357376
Stephen picked it up and put it on. Haines called to them from the	 40.41536270581396
doorway:	 4130.1771016838475
—Are you coming, you fellows?	 205.35589538204022
—I’m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door. Come out,	 62.045288832315165
Kinch. You have eaten all we left, I suppose. Resigned he passed out	 81.25911934503874
with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:	 145.53035171397673
—And going forth he met Butterly.	 103.90257647793648
Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out	 91.39260306548192
and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and	 41.57620111214867
locked it. He put the huge key in his inner pocket.	 100.20866788199721
At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:	 22.283771854857516
—Did you bring the key?	 84.2418438342199
—I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.	 28.484887877637384
He walked on. Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy	 43.79936980947317
bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.	 8.63303864104494
—Down, sir! How dare you, sir!	 111.54936040719687
Haines asked:	 206.4341761930296
—Do you pay rent for this tower?	 64.45850093950276
—Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.	 34.274570250950646
—To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.	 47.04378799982723
They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:	 123.56791762095408
—Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. Martello you call it?	 33.62237800384523
—Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on	 46.8627121015613
the sea. But ours is the _omphalos_.	 33.90535430475625
—What is your idea of Hamlet? Haines asked Stephen.	 56.73051149129419
—No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain. I’m not equal to Thomas Aquinas	 47.14999060281598
and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up. Wait till I	 42.12476141037756
have a few pints in me first.	 79.28593724427726
He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his	 46.10870189052622
primrose waistcoat:	 114.90986398798026
—You couldn’t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?	 81.88529201048081
—It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.	 61.123722352901076
—You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably. Is it some paradox?	 43.49431357326969
—Pooh! Buck Mulligan said. We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.	 19.615774900419627
It’s quite simple. He proves by algebra that Hamlet’s grandson is	 85.09249153344668
Shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own	 71.24503736551645
father.	 438.4362250098381
—What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. He himself?	 89.97048533947292
Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in	 28.414939008606872
loose laughter, said to Stephen’s ear:	 162.8653511350442
—O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!	 93.63451891172825
—We’re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. And it is	 55.55014394427651
rather long to tell.	 185.78162588320194
Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.	 37.74962173690556
—The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.	 76.39388773532453
—I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this	 59.406162241770296
tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. _That	 76.16677820829632
beetles o’er his base into the sea,_ isn’t it?	 70.8287847994433
Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did	 76.23832359194988
not speak. In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in	 70.81292102592467
cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.	 108.39799440239048
—It’s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.	 59.61477823031571
Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.	 144.86706566446958
The seas’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the	 32.36354443179536
smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail	 16.34310189451177
tacking by the Muglins.	 8.193309680792458
—I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.	 30.00760155436364
The Father and the Son idea. The Son striving to be atoned with the	 40.9045312855023
Father.	 438.4362250098381
Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. He looked	 60.815786437129965
at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had	 80.11615484876913
suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. He moved	 100.32895830120826
a doll’s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and	 21.13023838293114
began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:	 62.55642959911691
_—I’m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.	 128.83676360402538
My mother’s a jew, my father’s a bird.	 163.5013852786727
With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.	 42.161561667387005
So here’s to disciples and Calvary._	 36.045210239205666
He held up a forefinger of warning.	 57.45030824250905
_—If anyone thinks that I amn’t divine	 155.16348507057032
He’ll get no free drinks when I’m making the wine	 206.8233131356832
But have to drink water and wish it were plain	 109.58280677319588
That I make when the wine becomes water again._	 200.2943803370633
He tugged swiftly at Stephen’s ashplant in farewell and, running	 59.72167857054844
forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like	 60.48235946399875
fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:	 31.359093274389785
_—Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said	 76.33593850968754
And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.	 144.2638783459097
What’s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly	 61.081280589099265
And Olivet’s breezy... Goodbye, now, goodbye!_	 51.124395003405525
He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his	 36.75963192537815
winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh	 74.58749460290997
wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.	 186.61797883545572
Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and	 150.1959017922373
said:	 674.7359038427248
—We oughtn’t to laugh, I suppose. He’s rather blasphemous. I’m not a	 58.09784572664548
believer myself, that is to say. Still his gaiety takes the harm out of	 62.66675907760545
it somehow, doesn’t it? What did he call it? Joseph the Joiner?	 67.35549727559246
—The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.	 92.1284724422445
—O, Haines said, you have heard it before?	 74.44343520695547
—Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.	 34.275142255831796
—You’re not a believer, are you? Haines asked. I mean, a believer in	 37.366622070068104
the narrow sense of the word. Creation from nothing and miracles and a	 21.16144314798039
personal God.	 225.05373251226086
—There’s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.	 39.02879850421387
Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a	 109.37985383030646
green stone. He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.	 112.76880201319018
—Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.	 54.362072415688
Haines helped himself and snapped the case to. He put it back in his	 41.63569067054512
sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang	 63.13943289600106
it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk	 119.13801072863689
towards Stephen in the shell of his hands.	 90.9293261420915
—Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. Either you believe or	 57.73507842004155
you don’t, isn’t it? Personally I couldn’t stomach that idea of a	 45.037228423591586
personal God. You don’t stand for that, I suppose?	 55.5564403496772
—You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible	 64.69741492546437
example of free thought.	 790.3992851847366
He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his	 53.72195784222025
side. Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.	 94.0454671359825
My familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line	 89.46890947470183
along the path. They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark.	 86.51293193749686
He wants that key. It is mine. I paid the rent. Now I eat his salt	 89.24692344252395
bread. Give him the key too. All. He will ask for it. That was in his	 123.73884204309282
eyes.	 1072.0948183353323
—After all, Haines began...	 149.74495520606683
Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was	 114.32991001034809
not all unkind.	 84.79200132013821
—After all, I should think you are able to free yourself. You are your	 79.65056393998158
own master, it seems to me.	 196.46512927934566
—I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an	 48.472766196272495
Italian.	 5683.555916376987
—Italian? Haines said.	 78.68970234771791
A crazy queen, old and jealous. Kneel down before me.	 110.46689878814554
—And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.	 60.8247887802014
—Italian? Haines said again. What do you mean?	 35.13351152722295
—The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and	 71.37284026347207
the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.	 50.941280004648426
Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he	 53.44622232061686
spoke.	 7544.66136882191
—I can quite understand that, he said calmly. An Irishman must think	 100.02897607225098
like that, I daresay. We feel in England that we have treated you	 50.84591540092041
rather unfairly. It seems history is to blame.	 45.607165544004644
The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen’s memory the triumph of	 29.04456700166202
their brazen bells: _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam	 21.155885965202913
ecclesiam:_ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own	 28.636883162308884
rare thoughts, a chemistry of stars. Symbol of the apostles in the mass	 38.31912259944215
for pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in	 73.9393605142066
affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church	 28.358068063836424
militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs. A horde of heresies	 9.018128458459824
fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom	 21.389964949370786
Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the	 44.31728800783935
consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning	 20.139278134528492
Christ’s terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who	 36.07368581385062
held that the Father was Himself His own Son. Words Mulligan had spoken	 112.7686542767395
a moment since in mockery to the stranger. Idle mockery. The void	 74.48533654728918
awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a	 60.029865730913336
worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael’s host, who	 82.60413746969797
defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their	 40.58181933271761
shields.	 4.608171674364364
Hear, hear! Prolonged applause. _Zut! Nom de Dieu!_	 63.48468708645254
—Of course I’m a Britisher, Haines’s voice said, and I feel as one. I	 63.0993596909688
don’t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.	 55.80467593553061
That’s our national problem, I’m afraid, just now.	 245.24807324345397
Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman,	 27.342517691641547
boatman.	 20952.70010419261
—She’s making for Bullock harbour.	 140.85083352645987
The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.	 51.2861547207499
—There’s five fathoms out there, he said. It’ll be swept up that way	 107.21248769432782
when the tide comes in about one. It’s nine days today.	 158.87331749816866
The man that was drowned. A sail veering about the blank bay waiting	 78.7121584850198
for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face,	 92.03499438000266
saltwhite. Here I am.	 50.27559606732708
They followed the winding path down to the creek. Buck Mulligan stood	 33.52062424687051
on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his	 92.06477054142883
shoulder. A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly	 48.050612088111656
frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.	 41.223163174602554
—Is the brother with you, Malachi?	 197.5129579233494
—Down in Westmeath. With the Bannons.	 24.770835437632254
—Still there? I got a card from Bannon. Says he found a sweet young	 73.16899252003238
thing down there. Photo girl he calls her.	 99.86598504392265
—Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure.	 55.54701340460695
Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. An elderly man shot up near	 33.51618347732269
the spur of rock a blowing red face. He scrambled up by the stones,	 43.10121147231079
water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water	 45.64973945281507
rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black	 21.415880501775117
sagging loincloth.	 4.411654744205047
Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines	 64.55487814363734
and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and	 54.9278652021775
lips and breastbone.	 60.44760711930902
—Seymour’s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of	 71.62445698169034
rock. Chucked medicine and going in for the army.	 109.74468863161123
—Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.	 39.88678709513584
—Going over next week to stew. You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?	 102.73090699031482
—Yes.	 220.63927910459736
—Spooning with him last night on the pier. The father is rotto with	 55.74463979969168
money.	 3471.2276245549806
—Is she up the pole?	 83.89976393066372
—Better ask Seymour that.	 334.02943555098994
—Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.	 109.77013101050844
He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying	 73.90802338983116
tritely:	 4.608171674364364
—Redheaded women buck like goats.	 294.6009295032961
He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.	 61.18834968390347
—My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. I’m the _Übermensch._ Toothless	 41.95154699857247
Kinch and I, the supermen.	 97.55512367100692
He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his	 32.63595866888999
clothes lay.	 2824.043491635293
—Are you going in here, Malachi?	 55.930686896203596
—Yes. Make room in the bed.	 51.07205157046279
The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the	 66.7171688895926
middle of the creek in two long clean strokes. Haines sat down on a	 38.116007325241675
stone, smoking.	 1770.089324287722
—Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked.	 54.80430882155305
—Later on, Haines said. Not on my breakfast.	 191.99667999010043
Stephen turned away.	 38.42197458448705
—I’m going, Mulligan, he said.	 84.53138463469497
—Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.	 46.98616805479003
Stephen handed him the key. Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped	 30.416979468265016
clothes.	 8381.466564865386
—And twopence, he said, for a pint. Throw it there.	 50.996624607434306
Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap. Dressing, undressing. Buck	 91.44656884008351
Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:	 93.28422265651967
—He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Thus spake	 27.004049813782675
Zarathustra.	 4.608171674364364
His plump body plunged.	 88.51463430005711
—We’ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the	 91.09061088118528
path and smiling at wild Irish.	 297.16258776824463
Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.	 75.69393691650848
—The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried. Half twelve.	 71.51012995485753
—Good, Stephen said.	 63.45360524132342
He walked along the upwardcurving path.	 25.52688840068742
Liliata rutilantium.	 4.411654744205047
Turma circumdet.	 4.411654744205047
Iubilantium te virginum.	 25.32258179438146
The priest’s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly. I will	 42.094905339743974
not sleep here tonight. Home also I cannot go.	 138.78941038795145
A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea. Turning	 56.876280015456004
the curve he waved his hand. It called again. A sleek brown head, a	 91.34388600970422
seal’s, far out on the water, round.	 95.13481826610001
Usurper.	 4.608171674364364
[ 2 ]	 463.94842625767166
—You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?	 57.75149558335856
—Tarentum, sir.	 71.30110375561071
—Very good. Well?	 129.93346560728727
—There was a battle, sir.	 37.31644621676677
—Very good. Where?	 244.40717290266988
The boy’s blank face asked the blank window.	 90.72302232580248
Fabled by the daughters of memory. And yet it was in some way if not as	 59.07377292456195
memory fabled it. A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake’s wings	 99.1241379327013
of excess. I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling	 28.940090723933146
masonry, and time one livid final flame. What’s left us then?	 292.05229336403835
—I forget the place, sir. 279 B. C.	 107.90147354816894
—Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the	 13.912634308631485
gorescarred book.	 129.5599723577961
—Yes, sir. And he said: _Another victory like that and we are done	 66.46939972636615
for._	 197.21616341800117
That phrase the world had remembered. A dull ease of the mind. From a	 45.80326510590341
hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers,	 152.87396713369802
leaned upon his spear. Any general to any officers. They lend ear.	 436.45591502623824
—You, Armstrong, Stephen said. What was the end of Pyrrhus?	 40.54145033095363
—End of Pyrrhus, sir?	 117.80769455081065
—I know, sir. Ask me, sir, Comyn said.	 50.64156717021522
—Wait. You, Armstrong. Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?	 52.5718878559029
A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong’s satchel. He curled them	 56.33509430338563
between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly. Crumbs adhered	 79.16070464206854
to the tissue of his lips. A sweetened boy’s breath. Welloff people,	 84.00022977177274
proud that their eldest son was in the navy. Vico Road, Dalkey.	 114.92170900729992
—Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier.	 226.97185526926174
All laughed. Mirthless high malicious laughter. Armstrong looked round	 145.82974893544022
at his classmates, silly glee in profile. In a moment they will laugh	 42.3616843062454
more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.	 57.14111631115205
—Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy’s shoulder with the book,	 50.534139880793084
what is a pier.	 45.459799567749656
—A pier, sir, Armstrong said. A thing out in the water. A kind of a	 32.33364987114012
bridge. Kingstown pier, sir.	 48.41761835334251
Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning. Two in the back bench	 126.79631218688476
whispered. Yes. They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent.	 195.57067209216922
All. With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily. Their	 60.55610428269613
likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets	 50.04312176045621
tittering in the struggle.	 6.2586885757549
—Kingstown pier, Stephen said. Yes, a disappointed bridge.	 102.02538537779886
The words troubled their gaze.	 101.17295941149872
—How, sir? Comyn asked. A bridge is across a river.	 331.7705376882012
For Haines’s chapbook. No-one here to hear. Tonight deftly amid wild	 107.66417048051781
drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind. What then? A	 54.082326941469034
jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a	 18.240350533773036
clement master’s praise. Why had they chosen all that part? Not wholly	 91.12516518085505
for the smooth caress. For them too history was a tale like any other	 71.94412797816783
too often heard, their land a pawnshop.	 126.86698848377947
Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam’s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not	 52.837072351775944
been knifed to death. They are not to be thought away. Time has branded	 102.2724758542105
them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite	 34.45142751172391
possibilities they have ousted. But can those have been possible seeing	 102.35401409964423
that they never were? Or was that only possible which came to pass?	 121.28028552070724
Weave, weaver of the wind.	 80.89600985122445
—Tell us a story, sir.	 47.22717084578644
—O, do, sir. A ghoststory.	 48.23180313252073
—Where do you begin in this? Stephen asked, opening another book.	 117.65688017436959
—_Weep no more,_ Comyn said.	 56.38260451623428
—Go on then, Talbot.	 164.92727113917223
—And the story, sir?	 72.4479923349989
—After, Stephen said. Go on, Talbot.	 77.46101618143975
A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork	 55.75877770302807
of his satchel. He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text:	 51.73777096917082
_—Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more	 40.235854267809835
For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead,	 93.62614051004132
Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor..._	 72.04855435005032
It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible.	 44.14849887786799
Aristotle’s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated	 19.329314696393084
out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where	 60.643879908038166
he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night. By his	 85.36830704038722
elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy. Fed and feeding	 82.25355087346578
brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating	 207.98934503884678
feelers: and in my mind’s darkness a sloth of the underworld,	 17.781388634324113
reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds. Thought	 76.63786956992878
is the thought of thought. Tranquil brightness. The soul is in a manner	 125.08140607883956
all that is: the soul is the form of forms. Tranquility sudden, vast,	 75.15833996397922
candescent: form of forms.	 75.43632519507904
Talbot repeated:	 190.56290361389767
_—Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves,	 108.60870645332025
Through the dear might..._	 135.97488660445595
—Turn over, Stephen said quietly. I don’t see anything.	 70.26130995398867
—What, sir? Talbot asked simply, bending forward.	 75.8607463026927
His hand turned the page over. He leaned back and went on again, having	 73.59779234889155
just remembered. Of him that walked the waves. Here also over these	 154.59434765357332
craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer’s heart and lips and	 65.84784600267996
on mine. It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the	 87.5868949664763
tribute. To Caesar what is Caesar’s, to God what is God’s. A long look	 102.93885236456995
from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the	 33.47725325931085
church’s looms. Ay.	 51.38050068937979
Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro.	 73.37843616181954
My father gave me seeds to sow.	 28.698973065724022
Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel.	 213.2875242681119
—Have I heard all? Stephen asked.	 181.0071891601498
—Yes, sir. Hockey at ten, sir.	 107.51222010109765
—Half day, sir. Thursday.	 242.366782470414
—Who can answer a riddle? Stephen asked.	 63.311489442439
They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling.	 76.20125250838139
Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all	 39.56736970585907
gabbling gaily:	 258.6155822725471
—A riddle, sir? Ask me, sir.	 52.72443272755066
—O, ask me, sir.	 37.03215042560366
—A hard one, sir.	 235.87874556939954
—This is the riddle, Stephen said:	 38.314054699176964
The cock crew,	 57.90875263711151
The sky was blue:	 113.8149610435901
The bells in heaven	 159.07675813545103
Were striking eleven.	 454.72080737734603
’Tis time for this poor soul	 188.35947565909254
To go to heaven.	 82.19846569234063
What is that?	 17.745577723176048
—What, sir?	 208.2732062990253
—Again, sir. We didn’t hear.	 150.50681610475834
Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated. After a silence	 60.16527169030161
Cochrane said:	 71.17402650638314
—What is it, sir? We give it up.	 46.050221959858966
Stephen, his throat itching, answered:	 203.52015671605758
—The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.	 39.05886387046525
He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries	 69.72411854017663
echoed dismay.	 4.411654744205047
A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:	 61.58396909604449
—Hockey!	 4.608171674364364
They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them. Quickly	 72.03809888663687
they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and	 87.656068253144
clamour of their boots and tongues.	 54.42184815204806
Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open	 216.14264668198163
copybook. His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness	 46.30310107538603
and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading. On his	 41.973940537463335
cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent	 106.50101196691607
and damp as a snail’s bed.	 133.66708602007245
He held out his copybook. The word _Sums_ was written on the headline.	 28.19231001064848
Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with	 187.1758229921015
blind loops and a blot. Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.	 79.2063664070204
—Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them	 48.239666293069
to you, sir.	 114.76565101515017
Stephen touched the edges of the book. Futility.	 22.34882340436412
—Do you understand how to do them now? he asked.	 45.77359171647502
—Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered. Mr Deasy said I was to	 55.467368242862435
copy them off the board, sir.	 238.02504565822235
—Can you do them yourself? Stephen asked.	 104.17498085146353
—No, sir.	 90.80290880287114
Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a	 40.20814047850207
snail’s bed. Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in	 66.24701824181896
her heart. But for her the race of the world would have trampled him	 51.56753224886742
underfoot, a squashed boneless snail. She had loved his weak watery	 19.321078153785816
blood drained from her own. Was that then real? The only true thing in	 110.00703613940182
life? His mother’s prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal	 60.12868868854894
bestrode. She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in	 38.66741350825939
the fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes. She had saved him from	 47.716839341954866
being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been. A poor	 58.050045536499354
soul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red	 167.41288198605548
reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the	 32.900801954672886
earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.	 36.39689934472643
Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem. He proves by	 71.02436617766746
algebra that Shakespeare’s ghost is Hamlet’s grandfather. Sargent	 131.44301896210024
peered askance through his slanted glasses. Hockeysticks rattled in the	 89.987416245439
lumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.	 52.60127315041772
Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of	 58.78242264724439
their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes. Give hands,	 89.25179482969043
traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors. Gone too from	 58.28735277149067
the world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and	 77.92146374711942
movement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the	 71.43388239797096
world, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not	 194.23073816848245
comprehend.	 4.608171674364364
—Do you understand now? Can you work the second for yourself?	 115.95903815427101
—Yes, sir.	 32.67659391838357
In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data. Waiting always for a	 84.65587757497592
word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint	 83.45142023180065
hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin. _Amor matris:_ subjective	 73.67043340586137
and objective genitive. With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had	 42.16825651671375
fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.	 71.15817574843159
Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness. My	 240.859514067568
childhood bends beside me. Too far for me to lay a hand there once or	 93.28989596060622
lightly. Mine is far and his secret as our eyes. Secrets, silent, stony	 238.13942243153372
sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their	 54.62955651553676
tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.	 26.393216674812805
The sum was done.	 139.47180567819032
—It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.	 30.845708537133795
—Yes, sir. Thanks, Sargent answered.	 18.813853300251726
He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his	 40.743861146567994
copybook back to his bench.	 49.40627014514418
—You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said	 71.79042938767475
as he followed towards the door the boy’s graceless form.	 63.62694046213823
—Yes, sir.	 32.67659391838357
In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.	 42.806764409143724
—Sargent!	 9044.19630951339
—Run on, Stephen said. Mr Deasy is calling you.	 96.92491906109822
He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy	 32.01515621090724
field where sharp voices were in strife. They were sorted in teams and	 43.38193948198552
Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet.	 42.82721891129325
When he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to	 48.04347983585124
him. He turned his angry white moustache.	 127.35425846913945
—What is it now? he cried continually without listening.	 55.98303272128363
—Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.	 21.157367186198233
—Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore	 37.47363918047632
order here.	 2119.390531789682
And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man’s voice	 85.32594164763448
cried sternly:	 300.6460354808551
—What is the matter? What is it now?	 37.99902695626915
Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms	 144.01276937986242
closed round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his	 27.2369960950667
illdyed head.	 77.85214662983833
Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded	 45.45870001542836
leather of its chairs. As on the first day he bargained with me here.	 76.98460232823396
As it was in the beginning, is now. On the sideboard the tray of Stuart	 28.776202402503134
coins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be. And snug in their	 68.93871305996686
spooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached	 71.27245079855228
to all the gentiles: world without end.	 71.03685408432969
A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor. Blowing out his	 45.56997568732283
rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.	 45.4350484090786
—First, our little financial settlement, he said.	 61.990687875372835
He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong. It	 65.16822641054596
slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and	 55.937701576019556
laid them carefully on the table.	 116.52769490107349
—Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.	 45.10623203450177
And now his strongroom for the gold. Stephen’s embarrassed hand moved	 113.05488125318753
over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money	 68.34962958825854
cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir’s turban, and	 31.971934033905132
this, the scallop of saint James. An old pilgrim’s hoard, dead	 45.02967229634567
treasure, hollow shells.	 1185.6946044352762
A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.	 66.57550556589915
—Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand.	 57.06230811259469
These are handy things to have. See. This is for sovereigns. This is	 142.23170592009282
for shillings. Sixpences, halfcrowns. And here crowns. See.	 85.73753706323454
He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.	 88.98728779902973
—Three twelve, he said. I think you’ll find that’s right.	 56.22963993336537
—Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy	 55.75299513851091
haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.	 76.61553590209533
—No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said. You have earned it.	 44.47718225399443
Stephen’s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. Symbols too	 70.07590578840926
of beauty and of power. A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed	 60.61458702277332
and misery.	 150.27040961726354
—Don’t carry it like that, Mr Deasy said. You’ll pull it out somewhere	 42.03626477526965
and lose it. You just buy one of these machines. You’ll find them very	 39.22094612998716
handy.	 20141.521272665428
Answer something.	 1289.2669325242337
—Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.	 115.27637275682379
The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same. Three times	 114.3585632736083
now. Three nooses round me here. Well? I can break them in this instant	 92.43429736912434
if I will.	 45.35001461627237
—Because you don’t save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger. You don’t	 70.42025153326654
know yet what money is. Money is power. When you have lived as long as	 96.51623711346865
I have. I know, I know. If youth but knew. But what does Shakespeare	 50.89491625485844
say? _Put but money in thy purse._	 363.7162717759403
—Iago, Stephen murmured.	 63.562296749240275
He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man’s stare.	 56.73822674773912
—He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said. He made money. A poet, yes, but	 74.48163100618476
an Englishman too. Do you know what is the pride of the English? Do you	 28.930391520668266
know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman’s	 33.193011581254886
mouth?	 1322.9667689470998
The seas’ ruler. His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems	 26.109390010560002
history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.	 96.18284215099048
—That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.	 70.68836077989668
—Ba! Mr Deasy cried. That’s not English. A French Celt said that. He	 103.69604254630903
tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.	 34.585142525783255
—I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast. _I paid	 21.34068938433789
my way._	 162.98057887127953
Good man, good man.	 139.0290594114741
_—I paid my way. I never borrowed a shilling in my life._ Can you feel	 53.96393529766851
that? _I owe nothing._ Can you?	 91.87560780184893
Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties.	 140.6555055895713
Curran, ten guineas. McCann, one guinea. Fred Ryan, two shillings.	 55.99526065081487
Temple, two lunches. Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob	 188.5073106700361
Reynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five	 79.50856568272471
weeks’ board. The lump I have is useless.	 225.1230083247003
—For the moment, no, Stephen answered.	 56.357904865610415
Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.	 40.95563698399555
—I knew you couldn’t, he said joyously. But one day you must feel it.	 55.77255421328713
We are a generous people but we must also be just.	 167.49600589857766
—I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.	 129.35784241152726
Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the	 33.752441990341055
shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward, prince of	 47.93544604011443
Wales.	 4.608171674364364
—You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said.	 34.70258652882852
I saw three generations since O’Connell’s time. I remember the famine	 55.884690654158724
in ’46. Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the	 26.40538586589993
union twenty years before O’Connell did or before the prelates of your	 124.84878907823384
communion denounced him as a demagogue? You fenians forget some things.	 103.73666617959339
Glorious, pious and immortal memory. The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the	 210.22847701788743
splendid behung with corpses of papishes. Hoarse, masked and armed, the	 28.313839689254163
planters’ covenant. The black north and true blue bible. Croppies lie	 86.29584352325072
down.	 1025.5544802207955
Stephen sketched a brief gesture.	 92.56611844126854
—I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said. On the spindle side. But	 56.50511588343982
I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union. We are	 51.604825354916436
all Irish, all kings’ sons.	 232.80352668045464
—Alas, Stephen said.	 79.30408577003487
—_Per vias rectas_, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto. He voted for	 34.053245893752255
it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to	 48.209562803684335
do so.	 218.56850360755402
Lal the ral the ra	 24.062844328623
The rocky road to Dublin.	 52.90779207385332
A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots. Soft day, sir John!	 57.728501357972895
Soft day, your honour!... Day!... Day!... Two topboots jog dangling on	 114.60677921671518
to Dublin. Lal the ral the ra. Lal the ral the raddy.	 23.05349525428784
—That reminds me, Mr Deasy said. You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus,	 28.031634315158367
with some of your literary friends. I have a letter here for the press.	 86.70434378817052
Sit down a moment. I have just to copy the end.	 50.689260934373046
He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read	 45.239215021299024
off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.	 69.71385048969181
—Sit down. Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, _the dictates of	 22.979972718891347
common sense._ Just a moment.	 177.95765938650626
He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow	 45.190673695496045
and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly,	 30.661994242254277
sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.	 56.72364388634003
Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence. Framed	 67.14134553626
around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek	 108.66306501924275
heads poised in air: lord Hastings’ _Repulse_, the duke of	 66.5897145745237
Westminster’s _Shotover_, the duke of Beaufort’s _Ceylon_, _prix de	 12.553554572151455
Paris_, 1866. Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign. He saw their	 113.54463487371078
speeds, backing king’s colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished	 85.39746691339587
crowds.	 4.608171674364364
—Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys. _But prompt ventilation of this	 67.41235172638697
allimportant question..._	 139.21984507817018
Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the	 59.28142071473783
mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek	 18.568980439436288
of the canteen, over the motley slush. Even money _Fair Rebel._ Ten to	 47.952936681772854
one the field. Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs,	 118.0002965180197
the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman, a butcher’s	 32.04490120321092
dame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.	 50.01688116377875
Shouts rang shrill from the boys’ playfield and a whirring whistle.	 40.695292715715205
Again: a goal. I am among them, among their battling bodies in a	 89.97121895593592
medley, the joust of life. You mean that knockkneed mother’s darling	 51.95865873820164
who seems to be slightly crawsick? Jousts. Time shocked rebounds, shock	 51.635494327293046
by shock. Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of	 39.86678378428254
the slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men’s bloodied guts.	 37.33574011010491
—Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.	 75.50158620589282
He came to the table, pinning together his sheets. Stephen stood up.	 65.99991298223807
—I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said. It’s about the	 44.44648605138397
foot and mouth disease. Just look through it. There can be no two	 84.9176648315561
opinions on the matter.	 43.26887609259517
May I trespass on your valuable space. That doctrine of _laissez faire_	 40.62535453485206
which so often in our history. Our cattle trade. The way of all our old	 99.5189593222356
industries. Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme.	 84.3138627281902
European conflagration. Grain supplies through the narrow waters of the	 11.24132270055747
channel. The pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of	 5.2759475827997235
agriculture. Pardoned a classical allusion. Cassandra. By a woman who	 12.88805023700312
was no better than she should be. To come to the point at issue.	 42.4575547044859
—I don’t mince words, do I? Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.	 98.29395988403718
Foot and mouth disease. Known as Koch’s preparation. Serum and virus.	 18.05753828189453
Percentage of salted horses. Rinderpest. Emperor’s horses at Mürzsteg,	 29.375943996701448
lower Austria. Veterinary surgeons. Mr Henry Blackwood Price. Courteous	 62.17582006337252
offer a fair trial. Dictates of common sense. Allimportant question. In	 84.23814006458915
every sense of the word take the bull by the horns. Thanking you for	 73.73746204485624
the hospitality of your columns.	 12.482612476838865
—I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said. You will see at the	 41.08598751973059
next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle. And it can be	 98.61985651971727
cured. It is cured. My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is	 152.4531181557153
regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there. They	 78.70873775990626
offer to come over here. I am trying to work up influence with the	 56.36016738845342
department. Now I’m going to try publicity. I am surrounded by	 37.00580951588677
difficulties, by... intrigues by... backstairs influence by...	 46.44718577907622
He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.	 51.624163836206016
—Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said. England is in the hands of the	 48.75684821059589
jews. In all the highest places: her finance, her press. And they are	 55.504733034132514
the signs of a nation’s decay. Wherever they gather they eat up the	 31.144521964516795
nation’s vital strength. I have seen it coming these years. As sure as	 98.07826550198718
we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of	 96.40536483852297
destruction. Old England is dying.	 85.87416930976948
He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a	 90.33618549385626
broad sunbeam. He faced about and back again.	 135.5481609634488
—Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.	 124.61497502221786
The harlot’s cry from street to street	 187.8464645377915
Shall weave old England’s windingsheet.	 34.0966398389712
His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which	 56.294720979752306
he halted.	 55.6109274974823
—A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or	 82.39768391795492
gentile, is he not?	 35.34355215260848
—They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely. And you can see	 30.12411337653868
the darkness in their eyes. And that is why they are wanderers on the	 48.117415493753995
earth to this day.	 207.42015561528618
On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting	 42.198450815511606
prices on their gemmed fingers. Gabble of geese. They swarmed loud,	 76.5803965106155
uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit	 50.67420015757391
silk hats. Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures.	 184.1440977385197
Their full slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and	 94.46916838330385
unoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their	 49.51326664059998
zeal was vain. Vain patience to heap and hoard. Time surely would	 71.443239081176
scatter all. A hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on.	 18.13305797166284
Their eyes knew their years of wandering and, patient, knew the	 258.1068110920166
dishonours of their flesh.	 38.74688800119503
—Who has not? Stephen said.	 38.00797708013052
—What do you mean? Mr Deasy asked.	 19.10751720657776
He came forward a pace and stood by the table. His underjaw fell	 39.92878185221996
sideways open uncertainly. Is this old wisdom? He waits to hear from	 171.46411031923873
me.	 695.4423238734375
—History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.	 27.58198269628645
From the playfield the boys raised a shout. A whirring whistle: goal.	 51.44343888167176
What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?	 118.41084367199953
—The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said. All human	 61.96298251589334
history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.	 73.34391085722932
Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:	 64.59094594759219
—That is God.	 158.07003166363302
Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee!	 52.71647391569307
—What? Mr Deasy asked.	 36.47450806971089
—A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.	 64.60579141784284
Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked	 55.871907330277836
between his fingers. Looking up again he set them free.	 93.16935462713921
—I am happier than you are, he said. We have committed many errors and	 33.179298131067455
many sins. A woman brought sin into the world. For a woman who was no	 34.998910925524406
better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten	 51.73207615976537
years the Greeks made war on Troy. A faithless wife first brought the	 166.52559611577732
strangers to our shore here, MacMurrough’s wife and her leman,	 69.68471166883832
O’Rourke, prince of Breffni. A woman too brought Parnell low. Many	 205.47911896288284
errors, many failures but not the one sin. I am a struggler now at the	 69.08431583462624
end of my days. But I will fight for the right till the end.	 46.52474253536056
For Ulster will fight	 162.57420519316412
And Ulster will be right.	 96.42850842595588
Stephen raised the sheets in his hand.	 36.68100229634849
—Well, sir, he began.	 204.1830317098448
—I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at	 71.64811300135727
this work. You were not born to be a teacher, I think. Perhaps I am	 37.242958738049985
wrong.	 5903.169647924619
—A learner rather, Stephen said.	 58.74279646858179
And here what will you learn more?	 110.23362339747122
Mr Deasy shook his head.	 18.079819014974117
—Who knows? he said. To learn one must be humble. But life is the great	 50.32730976846144
teacher.	 4.608171674364364
Stephen rustled the sheets again.	 42.32498909836695
—As regards these, he began.	 383.3035378296732
—Yes, Mr Deasy said. You have two copies there. If you can have them	 32.31586059917514
published at once.	 29.485050909172415
_ Telegraph. Irish Homestead._	 128.8613683191414
—I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow. I know two	 52.82103953873711
editors slightly.	 240.61513971460474
—That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly. I wrote last night to Mr Field,	 49.39602856042233
M.P. There is a meeting of the cattletraders’ association today at the	 28.360675784958286
City Arms hotel. I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting. You	 68.92863931250064
see if you can get it into your two papers. What are they?	 46.312849834808425
_—The Evening Telegraph..._	 27.042072154692516
—That will do, Mr Deasy said. There is no time to lose. Now I have to	 31.79123562428201
answer that letter from my cousin.	 229.27774581146323
—Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.	 20.92137898189066
Thank you.	 42.452717799045026
—Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk. I	 44.069171801104446
like to break a lance with you, old as I am.	 91.55347982444742
—Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.	 38.85970272435732
He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees,	 26.245909981577487
hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield. The	 76.85044407614049
lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate:	 27.144375070431213
toothless terrors. Still I will help him in his fight. Mulligan will	 72.01664982454183
dub me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard.	 64.85172100539879
—Mr Dedalus!	 27.957436637182774
Running after me. No more letters, I hope.	 115.03783053467498
—Just one moment.	 279.106326320497
—Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.	 20.384659933813783
Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.	 50.01976813671693
—I just wanted to say, he said. Ireland, they say, has the honour of	 34.84760337916697
being the only country which never persecuted the jews. Do you know	 73.45267471815819
that? No. And do you know why?	 67.43103089643029
He frowned sternly on the bright air.	 33.3059197169003
—Why, sir? Stephen asked, beginning to smile.	 66.65372384443205
—Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.	 33.25888755998279
A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a	 32.09998920452322
rattling chain of phlegm. He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing,	 89.39710928852828
his lifted arms waving to the air.	 52.995595774895705
—She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he	 80.57863314161047
stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path. That’s why.	 30.407609363871813
On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung	 64.2949761398943
spangles, dancing coins.	 68.59819601920174
[ 3 ]	 463.94842625767166
Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought	 117.26766539158984
through my eyes. Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn	 52.131086410348715
and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot. Snotgreen, bluesilver,	 31.773966766451544
rust: coloured signs. Limits of the diaphane. But he adds: in bodies.	 34.93541668792192
Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured. How? By	 96.19499301248831
knocking his sconce against them, sure. Go easy. Bald he was and a	 161.99840689511316
millionaire, _maestro di color che sanno_. Limit of the diaphane in.	 16.160422249453145
Why in? Diaphane, adiaphane. If you can put your five fingers through	 80.46487988852503
it it is a gate, if not a door. Shut your eyes and see.	 99.37524776386019
Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and	 40.62909189466946
shells. You are walking through it howsomever. I am, a stride at a	 73.10451394261658
time. A very short space of time through very short times of space.	 123.91443353158166
Five, six: the _nacheinander_. Exactly: and that is the ineluctable	 124.14948304897813
modality of the audible. Open your eyes. No. Jesus! If I fell over a	 45.38807212743859
cliff that beetles o’er his base, fell through the _nebeneinander_	 40.82045802029801
ineluctably! I am getting on nicely in the dark. My ash sword hangs at	 28.553262133714625
my side. Tap with it: they do. My two feet in his boots are at the ends	 191.29709320760367
of his legs, _nebeneinander_. Sounds solid: made by the mallet of _Los	 34.157131367311294
Demiurgos_. Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand? Crush,	 65.45346963194926
crack, crick, crick. Wild sea money. Dominie Deasy kens them a’.	 209.43793627653073
Won’t you come to Sandymount,	 173.8797865946434
Madeline the mare?	 41.73913422340614
Rhythm begins, you see. I hear. A catalectic tetrameter of iambs	 28.88275514597231
marching. No, agallop: _deline the mare_.	 90.63424498625652
Open your eyes now. I will. One moment. Has all vanished since? If I	 162.1392330003004
open and am for ever in the black adiaphane. _Basta!_ I will see if I	 65.18561339865462
can see.	 143.04831814223286
See now. There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world	 104.50591224453122
without end.	 686.2599393817492
They came down the steps from Leahy’s terrace prudently,	 46.802498553944375
_Frauenzimmer_: and down the shelving shore flabbily, their splayed	 32.758029790341816
feet sinking in the silted sand. Like me, like Algy, coming down to our	 64.8415809614452
mighty mother. Number one swung lourdily her midwife’s bag, the other’s	 70.40250802074912
gamp poked in the beach. From the liberties, out for the day. Mrs	 36.02704637050903
Florence MacCabe, relict of the late Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented, of	 16.45971630011303
Bride Street. One of her sisterhood lugged me squealing into life.	 65.89909859671685
Creation from nothing. What has she in the bag? A misbirth with a	 87.88785344764158
trailing navelcord, hushed in ruddy wool. The cords of all link back,	 36.186959613380445
strandentwining cable of all flesh. That is why mystic monks. Will you	 47.57359069752713
be as gods? Gaze in your _omphalos_. Hello. Kinch here. Put me on to	 177.00694229261373
Edenville. Aleph, alpha: nought, nought, one.	 37.16617289198586
Spouse and helpmate of Adam Kadmon: Heva, naked Eve. She had no navel.	 60.457676461109564
Gaze. Belly without blemish, bulging big, a buckler of taut vellum, no,	 74.32579365478428
whiteheaped corn, orient and immortal, standing from everlasting to	 42.50940933781268
everlasting. Womb of sin.	 133.55563956711958
Wombed in sin darkness I was too, made not begotten. By them, the man	 75.25319556283789
with my voice and my eyes and a ghostwoman with ashes on her breath.	 63.89471124290142
They clasped and sundered, did the coupler’s will. From before the ages	 107.85723857591667
He willed me and now may not will me away or ever. A _lex eterna_ stays	 167.0059755143095
about Him. Is that then the divine substance wherein Father and Son are	 119.10812298904146
consubstantial? Where is poor dear Arius to try conclusions? Warring	 42.25163663043051
his life long upon the contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality. Illstarred	 19.305519725010345
heresiarch! In a Greek watercloset he breathed his last: _euthanasia_.	 41.45663581303396
With beaded mitre and with crozier, stalled upon his throne, widower of	 31.82909777264612
a widowed see, with upstiffed _omophorion_, with clotted hinderparts.	 20.435664958280427
Airs romped round him, nipping and eager airs. They are coming, waves.	 40.26242121848711
The whitemaned seahorses, champing, brightwindbridled, the steeds of	 6.2483439850691145
Mananaan.	 4.608171674364364
I mustn’t forget his letter for the press. And after? The Ship, half	 76.74827321659508
twelve. By the way go easy with that money like a good young imbecile.	 96.82024407319281
Yes, I must.	 82.82984666997145
His pace slackened. Here. Am I going to aunt Sara’s or not? My	 80.43244009201211
consubstantial father’s voice. Did you see anything of your artist	 77.51643259848201
brother Stephen lately? No? Sure he’s not down in Strasburg terrace	 116.64832550145712
with his aunt Sally? Couldn’t he fly a bit higher than that, eh? And	 111.61642638266721
and and and tell us, Stephen, how is uncle Si? O, weeping God, the	 196.15529872921516
things I married into! De boys up in de hayloft. The drunken little	 283.1011293846714
costdrawer and his brother, the cornet player. Highly respectable	 61.32347271203448
gondoliers! And skeweyed Walter sirring his father, no less! Sir. Yes,	 56.28549561356875
sir. No, sir. Jesus wept: and no wonder, by Christ!	 284.140035647277
I pull the wheezy bell of their shuttered cottage: and wait. They take	 56.008048674282186
me for a dun, peer out from a coign of vantage.	 22.573636245188837
—It’s Stephen, sir.	 1843.0568093485383
—Let him in. Let Stephen in.	 327.7454958786847
A bolt drawn back and Walter welcomes me.	 48.3139523149987
—We thought you were someone else.	 76.67269014564324
In his broad bed nuncle Richie, pillowed and blanketed, extends over	 51.78725726909941
the hillock of his knees a sturdy forearm. Cleanchested. He has washed	 32.16517948571409
the upper moiety.	 108.72713505515567
—Morrow, nephew.	 4.411654744205047
He lays aside the lapboard whereon he drafts his bills of costs for the	 21.58139875685091
eyes of master Goff and master Shapland Tandy, filing consents and	 25.764586194361048
common searches and a writ of _Duces Tecum_. A bogoak frame over his	 26.55672958255253
bald head: Wilde’s _Requiescat_. The drone of his misleading whistle	 28.80143048761038
brings Walter back.	 1126.293188556779
—Yes, sir?	 32.67659391838357
—Malt for Richie and Stephen, tell mother. Where is she?	 104.24598277187648
—Bathing Crissie, sir.	 29.989375290669766
Papa’s little bedpal. Lump of love.	 146.86414678698506
—No, uncle Richie...	 238.34623183488407
—Call me Richie. Damn your lithia water. It lowers. Whusky!	 98.72651560807546
—Uncle Richie, really...	 3065.9879473745254
—Sit down or by the law Harry I’ll knock you down.	 104.84921684129263
Walter squints vainly for a chair.	 54.61602247069569
—He has nothing to sit down on, sir.	 52.786754770292035
—He has nowhere to put it, you mug. Bring in our chippendale chair.	 73.33079637770135
Would you like a bite of something? None of your damned lawdeedaw airs	 42.870438277058895
here. The rich of a rasher fried with a herring? Sure? So much the	 81.84121793784726
better. We have nothing in the house but backache pills.	 86.19440966336673
_All’erta!_	 4.608171674364364
He drones bars of Ferrando’s _aria di sortita_. The grandest number,	 23.00069152388067
Stephen, in the whole opera. Listen.	 43.71584008018294
His tuneful whistle sounds again, finely shaded, with rushes of the	 101.13401609288648
air, his fists bigdrumming on his padded knees.	 43.974947975476134
This wind is sweeter.	 196.06285767326065
Houses of decay, mine, his and all. You told the Clongowes gentry you	 246.81672415050716
had an uncle a judge and an uncle a general in the army. Come out of	 87.01136965056762
them, Stephen. Beauty is not there. Nor in the stagnant bay of Marsh’s	 99.81066381139168
library where you read the fading prophecies of Joachim Abbas. For	 35.43352149531858
whom? The hundredheaded rabble of the cathedral close. A hater of his	 21.934170206597685
kind ran from them to the wood of madness, his mane foaming in the	 29.409580742606817
moon, his eyeballs stars. Houyhnhnm, horsenostrilled. The oval equine	 57.828923266959215
faces, Temple, Buck Mulligan, Foxy Campbell, Lanternjaws. Abbas father,	 35.765415052847366
furious dean, what offence laid fire to their brains? Paff! _Descende,	 54.906807759520454
calve, ut ne nimium decalveris_. A garland of grey hair on his	 17.18319714670194
comminated head see him me clambering down to the footpace	 55.95158372824127
(_descende!_), clutching a monstrance, basiliskeyed. Get down,	 56.22404059513506
baldpoll! A choir gives back menace and echo, assisting about the	 67.12373339705562
altar’s horns, the snorted Latin of jackpriests moving burly in their	 43.127160188498074
albs, tonsured and oiled and gelded, fat with the fat of kidneys of	 20.015156390250098
wheat.	 4.608171674364364
And at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is elevating	 66.83152027430994
it. Dringdring! And two streets off another locking it into a pyx.	 66.48861382719619
Dringadring! And in a ladychapel another taking housel all to his own	 55.01655897528506
cheek. Dringdring! Down, up, forward, back. Dan Occam thought of that,	 129.4233238900053
invincible doctor. A misty English morning the imp hypostasis tickled	 65.98320442083995
his brain. Bringing his host down and kneeling he heard twine with his	 45.137237708866266
second bell the first bell in the transept (he is lifting his) and,	 52.65370294195142
rising, heard (now I am lifting) their two bells (he is kneeling) twang	 103.74607313439144
in diphthong.	 25.877283914292452
Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint. Isle of saints. You were	 66.14567088147354
awfully holy, weren’t you? You prayed to the Blessed Virgin that you	 93.63296107676943
might not have a red nose. You prayed to the devil in Serpentine avenue	 67.41316338038774
that the fubsy widow in front might lift her clothes still more from	 109.05176550471364
the wet street. _O si, certo!_ Sell your soul for that, do, dyed rags	 82.31424108493013
pinned round a squaw. More tell me, more still! On the top of the Howth	 73.18986658151755
tram alone crying to the rain: _Naked women! Naked women!_ What about	 153.06788153891802
that, eh?	 192.06451417969132
What about what? What else were they invented for?	 69.94334458612911
Reading two pages apiece of seven books every night, eh? I was young.	 128.65530028722776
You bowed to yourself in the mirror, stepping forward to applause	 51.79007657383896
earnestly, striking face. Hurray for the Goddamned idiot! Hray! No-one	 127.32169471790066
saw: tell no-one. Books you were going to write with letters for	 168.73135736584692
titles. Have you read his F? O yes, but I prefer Q. Yes, but W is	 63.4070311579242
wonderful. O yes, W. Remember your epiphanies written on green oval	 196.73967115707632
leaves, deeply deep, copies to be sent if you died to all the great	 145.38530776714518
libraries of the world, including Alexandria? Someone was to read them	 41.18946343702303
there after a few thousand years, a mahamanvantara. Pico della	 28.950964525066293
Mirandola like. Ay, very like a whale. When one reads these strange	 112.05154563087049
pages of one long gone one feels that one is at one with one who	 138.72643400333996
once...	 4132.683032344385
The grainy sand had gone from under his feet. His boots trod again a	 49.844935308372
damp crackling mast, razorshells, squeaking pebbles, that on the	 86.97469613094975
unnumbered pebbles beats, wood sieved by the shipworm, lost Armada.	 61.83774748539102
Unwholesome sandflats waited to suck his treading soles, breathing	 48.005661555790766
upward sewage breath, a pocket of seaweed smouldered in seafire under a	 77.16448351423068
midden of man’s ashes. He coasted them, walking warily. A porterbottle	 30.372981439471722
stood up, stogged to its waist, in the cakey sand dough. A sentinel:	 26.7375120853719
isle of dreadful thirst. Broken hoops on the shore; at the land a maze	 49.19092497505185
of dark cunning nets; farther away chalkscrawled backdoors and on the	 35.69419204630376
higher beach a dryingline with two crucified shirts. Ringsend: wigwams	 43.95733430866386
of brown steersmen and master mariners. Human shells.	 100.51751928077968
He halted. I have passed the way to aunt Sara’s. Am I not going there?	 69.61143900201517
Seems not. No-one about. He turned northeast and crossed the firmer	 89.31266715545408
sand towards the Pigeonhouse.	 110.08131190023322

His feet marched in sudden proud rhythm over the sand furrows, along by	 72.15657411881593
the boulders of the south wall. He stared at them proudly, piled stone	 50.11916758159295
mammoth skulls. Gold light on sea, on sand, on boulders. The sun is	 117.4757165821384

Noon slumbers. Kevin Egan rolls gunpowder cigarettes through fingers	 157.45184893888535

Postprandial. There was a fellow I knew once in Barcelona, queer	 40.565701469296464
fellow, used to call it his postprandial. Well: _slainte!_ Around the	 52.93454144840248
slabbed tables the tangle of wined breaths and grumbling gorges. His	 12.574101871600387

you. I’ll show you my likeness one day. I was, faith. Lover, for her	 55.17146095633178
love he prowled with colonel Richard Burke, tanist of his sept, under	 51.91924085833366
the walls of Clerkenwell and, crouching, saw a flame of vengeance hurl	 19.580474619688815
them upward in the fog. Shattered glass and toppling masonry. In gay	 52.957012190558494
Paree he hides, Egan of Paris, unsought by any save by me. Making his	 75.61151981410946
day’s stations, the dingy printingcase, his three taverns, the	 43.54608910268712
Montmartre lair he sleeps short night in, rue de la Goutte-d’Or,	 22.210701561817753
damascened with flyblown faces of the gone. Loveless, landless,	 29.88152825398724
wifeless. She is quite nicey comfy without her outcast man, madame in	 66.5061506868369
rue Gît-le-Cœur, canary and two buck lodgers. Peachy cheeks, a zebra	 29.630314404454925
skirt, frisky as a young thing’s. Spurned and undespairing. Tell Pat	 123.13617167336793

Weak wasting hand on mine. They have forgotten Kevin Egan, not he them.	 151.4099871515784
Remembering thee, O Sion.	 126.19446350908228
He had come nearer the edge of the sea and wet sand slapped his boots.	 50.43415517087575
The new air greeted him, harping in wild nerves, wind of wild air of	 207.49303967294279
seeds of brightness. Here, I am not walking out to the Kish lightship,	 47.27595753855531
am I? He stood suddenly, his feet beginning to sink slowly in the	 54.44135801549512
quaking soil. Turn back.	 165.09393330773406
Turning, he scanned the shore south, his feet sinking again slowly in	 77.63977272495889
new sockets. The cold domed room of the tower waits. Through the	 67.99309809457779
barbacans the shafts of light are moving ever, slowly ever as my feet	 79.78508325621812
are sinking, creeping duskward over the dial floor. Blue dusk,	 62.38031239741001
nightfall, deep blue night. In the darkness of the dome they wait,	 62.48724490383564
their pushedback chairs, my obelisk valise, around a board of abandoned	 78.57501967363864
platters. Who to clear it? He has the key. I will not sleep there when	 123.63700926949063
this night comes. A shut door of a silent tower, entombing their blind	 105.37079949023759
bodies, the panthersahib and his pointer. Call: no answer. He lifted	 146.64262421082356
his feet up from the suck and turned back by the mole of boulders. Take	 74.31788185995823
all, keep all. My soul walks with me, form of forms. So in the moon’s	 94.40843459634488
midwatches I pace the path above the rocks, in sable silvered, hearing	 57.63972467900569
Elsinore’s tempting flood.	 47.983647330346734
The flood is following me. I can watch it flow past from here. Get back	 144.86221159350143
then by the Poolbeg road to the strand there. He climbed over the sedge	 39.74257304929502
and eely oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock, resting his ashplant in a	 22.904981461913383
grike.	 4.608171674364364
A bloated carcass of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack. Before him the	 33.450853009835996
gunwale of a boat, sunk in sand. _Un coche ensablé_ Louis Veuillot	 30.154584814660872
called Gautier’s prose. These heavy sands are language tide and wind	 191.6563885453373
have silted here. And these, the stoneheaps of dead builders, a warren	 47.63322442649592
of weasel rats. Hide gold there. Try it. You have some. Sands and	 77.66636435942576
stones. Heavy of the past. Sir Lout’s toys. Mind you don’t get one bang	 131.32119948294667
on the ear. I’m the bloody well gigant rolls all them bloody well	 163.26796111475795
boulders, bones for my steppingstones. Feefawfum. I zmellz de bloodz	 35.65225987935404
odz an Iridzman.	 17.84116441836289
A point, live dog, grew into sight running across the sweep of sand.	 65.37312602738125
Lord, is he going to attack me? Respect his liberty. You will not be	 89.6998493457509
master of others or their slave. I have my stick. Sit tight. From	 142.18491605802478
farther away, walking shoreward across from the crested tide, figures,	 121.81788894006402
two. The two maries. They have tucked it safe mong the bulrushes.	 63.533520958880125
Peekaboo. I see you. No, the dog. He is running back to them. Who?	 71.54722546249579
Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their	 50.31461491625173
bloodbeaked prows riding low on a molten pewter surf. Dane vikings,	 15.237352718748763
torcs of tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the	 17.763851134213258
collar of gold. A school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon,	 55.02709766955365
spouting, hobbling in the shallows. Then from the starving cagework	 10.896743622232114
city a horde of jerkined dwarfs, my people, with flayers’ knives,	 28.96576068170129
running, scaling, hacking in green blubbery whalemeat. Famine, plague	 56.32189666075062
and slaughters. Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves. I moved	 136.6460669083014
among them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the	 83.38871646404603
spluttering resin fires. I spoke to no-one: none to me.	 42.67921105871267
The dog’s bark ran towards him, stopped, ran back. Dog of my enemy. I	 89.59360108233737
just simply stood pale, silent, bayed about. _Terribilia meditans_. A	 110.53387967757885
primrose doublet, fortune’s knave, smiled on my fear. For that are you	 102.50650812489589
pining, the bark of their applause? Pretenders: live their lives. The	 50.278079753496776
Bruce’s brother, Thomas Fitzgerald, silken knight, Perkin Warbeck,	 28.907576568856882
York’s false scion, in breeches of silk of whiterose ivory, wonder of a	 104.73663920208591
day, and Lambert Simnel, with a tail of nans and sutlers, a scullion	 32.29862154400691
crowned. All kings’ sons. Paradise of pretenders then and now. He saved	 65.0149083332193
men from drowning and you shake at a cur’s yelping. But the courtiers	 52.55896913589126
who mocked Guido in Or san Michele were in their own house. House of...	 47.10261986040404
We don’t want any of your medieval abstrusiosities. Would you do what	 49.638796809038794
he did? A boat would be near, a lifebuoy. _Natürlich_, put there for	 65.8178507091761
you. Would you or would you not? The man that was drowned nine days ago	 47.845839591254745
off Maiden’s rock. They are waiting for him now. The truth, spit it	 68.4030465106605
out. I would want to. I would try. I am not a strong swimmer. Water	 81.50653503858692
cold soft. When I put my face into it in the basin at Clongowes. Can’t	 83.37020398457997
see! Who’s behind me? Out quickly, quickly! Do you see the tide flowing	 138.9698237512914
quickly in on all sides, sheeting the lows of sand quickly,	 50.613086346187906
shellcocoacoloured? If I had land under my feet. I want his life still	 103.69363710498259
to be his, mine to be mine. A drowning man. His human eyes scream to me	 107.84941843894704
out of horror of his death. I... With him together down... I could not	 106.44076430460352
save her. Waters: bitter death: lost.	 448.2986736775002
A woman and a man. I see her skirties. Pinned up, I bet.	 68.98821612886977
Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on	 115.14495857899948
all sides. Looking for something lost in a past life. Suddenly he made	 112.71845066408358
off like a bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a	 57.20627030230927
lowskimming gull. The man’s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears. He	 71.73802761985483
turned, bounded back, came nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks. On a	 146.15514941993774
field tenney a buck, trippant, proper, unattired. At the lacefringe of	 61.59585482047608
the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs, seawardpointed ears. His snout	 81.04242189368384
lifted barked at the wavenoise, herds of seamorse. They serpented	 23.80222428964877
towards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests, every ninth,	 76.72483124430151
breaking, plashing, from far, from farther out, waves and waves.	 152.51858930918718
Cocklepickers. They waded a little way in the water and, stooping,	 37.053411835928785
soused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out. The dog yelped	 41.55154355921471
running to them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again	 70.07954603561728
reared up at them with mute bearish fawning. Unheeded he kept by them	 38.86095058336794
as they came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf’s tongue redpanting	 42.55756657431458
from his jaws. His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped	 49.42840830509811
off at a calf’s gallop. The carcass lay on his path. He stopped,	 66.69569565781728
sniffed, stalked round it, brother, nosing closer, went round it,	 49.27872178399607
sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog’s bedraggled fell.	 86.97602698731026
Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes on the ground, moves to one great goal. Ah,	 45.24906724566857
poor dogsbody! Here lies poor dogsbody’s body.	 194.36006050412524
—Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel!	 55.02136629361543
The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless	 38.89906872062722
kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight. He	 67.0997586850054
slunk back in a curve. Doesn’t see me. Along by the edge of the mole he	 59.425352285389316
lolloped, dawdled, smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed	 58.008825582888434
against it. He trotted forward and, lifting again his hindleg, pissed	 61.709536621732674
quick short at an unsmelt rock. The simple pleasures of the poor. His	 176.85173418280758
hindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved.	 24.382435948529615
Something he buried there, his grandmother. He rooted in the sand,	 88.35776763377936
dabbling, delving and stopped to listen to the air, scraped up the sand	 36.21153718162703
again with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a pard, a panther, got in	 66.29546045448738
spousebreach, vulturing the dead.	 23.869119043024238
After he woke me last night same dream or was it? Wait. Open hallway.	 99.78842963136984
Street of harlots. Remember. Haroun al Raschid. I am almosting it. That	 44.307654129337855
man led me, spoke. I was not afraid. The melon he had he held against	 89.1717741394342

Red carpet spread. You will see who.	 48.92296781238186
Shouldering their bags they trudged, the red Egyptians. His blued feet	 36.080850162213466
out of turnedup trousers slapped the clammy sand, a dull brick muffler	 31.712388569666505
strangling his unshaven neck. With woman steps she followed: the	 68.49436293913537
ruffian and his strolling mort. Spoils slung at her back. Loose sand	 87.38265763038495
and shellgrit crusted her bare feet. About her windraw face hair	 47.796638416967696
trailed. Behind her lord, his helpmate, bing awast to Romeville. When	 40.41221950383099
night hides her body’s flaws calling under her brown shawl from an	 69.97725026788869
archway where dogs have mired. Her fancyman is treating two Royal	 56.902166908919895
Dublins in O’Loughlin’s of Blackpitts. Buss her, wap in rogues’ rum	 17.924754235245278
lingo, for, O, my dimber wapping dell! A shefiend’s whiteness under her	 23.35429475918019
rancid rags. Fumbally’s lane that night: the tanyard smells.	 38.75738167438695
White thy fambles, red thy gan	 141.5146398261944
And thy quarrons dainty is.	 134.72472712116877
Couch a hogshead with me then.	 176.83478915496505
In the darkmans clip and kiss.	 59.45519782310629
Morose delectation Aquinas tunbelly calls this, _frate porcospino_.	 16.790152160207285
Unfallen Adam rode and not rutted. Call away let him: _thy quarrons	 97.45956223701933
dainty is_. Language no whit worse than his. Monkwords, marybeads	 89.19554224903348
jabber on their girdles: roguewords, tough nuggets patter in their	 10.046625067462218
pockets.	 6710.406055504035
Passing now.	 895.3438754444754
A side eye at my Hamlet hat. If I were suddenly naked here as I sit? I	 128.02206111884928
am not. Across the sands of all the world, followed by the sun’s	 36.39540045083138
flaming sword, to the west, trekking to evening lands. She trudges,	 77.31106083601722
schlepps, trains, drags, trascines her load. A tide westering,	 33.628628805720254
moondrawn, in her wake. Tides, myriadislanded, within her, blood not	 52.97435009108325
mine, _oinopa ponton_, a winedark sea. Behold the handmaid of the moon.	 33.14902648431973
In sleep the wet sign calls her hour, bids her rise. Bridebed,	 123.93971938922168
childbed, bed of death, ghostcandled. _Omnis caro ad te veniet_. He	 31.469389936829057
comes, pale vampire, through storm his eyes, his bat sails bloodying	 63.983206618162136
the sea, mouth to her mouth’s kiss.	 91.45650152094882
Here. Put a pin in that chap, will you? My tablets. Mouth to her kiss.	 71.65638739022556
No. Must be two of em. Glue em well. Mouth to her mouth’s kiss.	 144.90805914039208
His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: mouth to her moomb.	 36.11507437400235
Oomb, allwombing tomb. His mouth moulded issuing breath, unspeeched:	 21.752409772737455
ooeeehah: roar of cataractic planets, globed, blazing, roaring	 24.74533477629689
wayawayawayawayaway. Paper. The banknotes, blast them. Old Deasy’s	 77.49820231614476
letter. Here. Thanking you for the hospitality tear the blank end off.	 122.52339327647645
Turning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table of rock and	 76.90396051275013
scribbled words. That’s twice I forgot to take slips from the library	 125.33556690881164
counter.	 8501.45569188669
His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending. Why not endless till	 115.46131382693551
the farthest star? Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness	 91.66701700933264
shining in the brightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds. Me sits there	 109.353435713217
with his augur’s rod of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid	 32.46604479171875
sea, unbeheld, in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth	 57.03827270933543
stars. I throw this ended shadow from me, manshape ineluctable, call it	 209.52992162771022
back. Endless, would it be mine, form of my form? Who watches me here?	 102.10862114887449
Who ever anywhere will read these written words? Signs on a white	 168.0371481408005
field. Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice. The good bishop of	 131.0129064536235
Cloyne took the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat: veil of space	 61.61742293398477
with coloured emblems hatched on its field. Hold hard. Coloured on a	 54.50182303490979
flat: yes, that’s right. Flat I see, then think distance, near, far,	 221.85619874047075
flat I see, east, back. Ah, see now! Falls back suddenly, frozen in	 164.99074862544595
stereoscope. Click does the trick. You find my words dark. Darkness is	 110.31285400451488
in our souls do you not think? Flutier. Our souls, shamewounded by our	 57.07710662508811
sins, cling to us yet more, a woman to her lover clinging, the more the	 129.6347909216012
more.	 1129.3064542327327
She trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes. Now where the blue	 75.5655764505903
hell am I bringing her beyond the veil? Into the ineluctable modality	 83.87692209829241
of the ineluctable visuality. She, she, she. What she? The virgin at	 198.0999708887107
Hodges Figgis’ window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet	 54.451874093832835
books you were going to write. Keen glance you gave her. Wrist through	 71.58771073251314
the braided jesse of her sunshade. She lives in Leeson park with a	 37.51770847250867
grief and kickshaws, a lady of letters. Talk that to someone else,	 120.18436765847044
Stevie: a pickmeup. Bet she wears those curse of God stays suspenders	 45.73135695971241
and yellow stockings, darned with lumpy wool. Talk about apple	 67.72668649780182
dumplings, _piuttosto_. Where are your wits?	 54.36472341945808
Touch me. Soft eyes. Soft soft soft hand. I am lonely here. O, touch me	 74.97401430223006
soon, now. What is that word known to all men? I am quiet here alone.	 67.58568884004649
Sad too. Touch, touch me.	 181.9924068841408
He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the	 53.533260589017516
scribbled note and pencil into a pocket, his hat tilted down on his	 57.924771807043165
eyes. That is Kevin Egan’s movement I made, nodding for his nap,	 113.44929215092404
sabbath sleep. _Et vidit Deus. Et erant valde bona_. Alo! _Bonjour_.	 22.17815843703775
Welcome as the flowers in May. Under its leaf he watched through	 213.97087645718048
peacocktwittering lashes the southing sun. I am caught in this burning	 47.54642315966717
scene. Pan’s hour, the faunal noon. Among gumheavy serpentplants,	 88.57205427940647
milkoozing fruits, where on the tawny waters leaves lie wide. Pain is	 204.3262531543974
far.	 2423.8344003412017
And no more turn aside and brood.	 16.053608400204098
His gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck’s castoffs,	 27.56875248058352
_nebeneinander_. He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein	 15.587288317231307
another’s foot had nested warm. The foot that beat the ground in	 121.58841506430811
tripudium, foot I dislove. But you were delighted when Esther Osvalt’s	 52.217494618719826
shoe went on you: girl I knew in Paris. _Tiens, quel petit pied!_	 65.8958143236485
Staunch friend, a brother soul: Wilde’s love that dare not speak its	 132.4023955299718
name. His arm: Cranly’s arm. He now will leave me. And the blame? As I	 148.26076196986264
am. As I am. All or not at all.	 128.19139612390703
In long lassoes from the Cock lake the water flowed full, covering	 99.23501160006246
greengoldenly lagoons of sand, rising, flowing. My ashplant will float	 54.168941412853975
away. I shall wait. No, they will pass on, passing, chafing against the	 165.31147566294064
low rocks, swirling, passing. Better get this job over quick. Listen: a	 387.0187433199972
fourworded wavespeech: seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos. Vehement breath of	 8.942232600604738
waters amid seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks. In cups of rocks it	 206.8378774732461
slops: flop, slop, slap: bounded in barrels. And, spent, its speech	 64.51244711493798
ceases. It flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower	 58.90847310391592
unfurling.	 4.608171674364364
Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and	 34.02089883633467
sway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water	 76.09490811610095
swaying and upturning coy silver fronds. Day by day: night by night:	 91.01260660010233
lifted, flooded and let fall. Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to,	 67.34293307263717
they sigh. Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting,	 136.09088626665968
awaiting the fullness of their times, _diebus ac noctibus iniurias	 12.8043745279192
patiens ingemiscit_. To no end gathered; vainly then released,	 48.80385414242427
forthflowing, wending back: loom of the moon. Weary too in sight of	 47.761134692529176
lovers, lascivious men, a naked woman shining in her courts, she draws	 150.07198942689706
a toil of waters.	 34.75428830294937
Five fathoms out there. Full fathom five thy father lies. At one, he	 178.37281579770817
said. Found drowned. High water at Dublin bar. Driving before it a	 135.72920435809888
loose drift of rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly shells. A corpse	 59.53369966166762
rising saltwhite from the undertow, bobbing a pace a pace a porpoise	 29.30186185011496
landward. There he is. Hook it quick. Pull. Sunk though he be beneath	 61.77148208862381
the watery floor. We have him. Easy now.	 38.206462637960435
Bag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine. A quiver of minnows, fat of a	 30.21315317445105
spongy titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly. God	 35.553287449558304
becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed	 172.74646640147694
mountain. Dead breaths I living breathe, tread dead dust, devour a	 237.24659481266653
urinous offal from all dead. Hauled stark over the gunwale he breathes	 25.872259168559257
upward the stench of his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to	 34.2869281550767
the sun.	 70.67507120277145
A seachange this, brown eyes saltblue. Seadeath, mildest of all deaths	 44.09613992970003
known to man. Old Father Ocean. _Prix de Paris_: beware of imitations.	 98.79111856407667
Just you give it a fair trial. We enjoyed ourselves immensely.	 82.95504196035445
Come. I thirst. Clouding over. No black clouds anywhere, are there?	 140.29001975043462
Thunderstorm. Allbright he falls, proud lightning of the intellect,	 34.04518001238451
_Lucifer, dico, qui nescit occasum_. No. My cockle hat and staff and	 31.600178660538248
hismy sandal shoon. Where? To evening lands. Evening will find itself.	 46.93725705589504
He took the hilt of his ashplant, lunging with it softly, dallying	 27.409169597854106
still. Yes, evening will find itself in me, without me. All days make	 182.81228487985072
their end. By the way next when is it Tuesday will be the longest day.	 70.55793573061408
Of all the glad new year, mother, the rum tum tiddledy tum. Lawn	 88.53444384558273
Tennyson, gentleman poet. _Già_. For the old hag with the yellow teeth.	 46.367734672451306
And Monsieur Drumont, gentleman journalist. _Già_. My teeth are very	 125.27544607908574
bad. Why, I wonder. Feel. That one is going too. Shells. Ought I go to	 148.6256475187595
a dentist, I wonder, with that money? That one. This. Toothless Kinch,	 111.66548511763072
the superman. Why is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps?	 87.49627147721249
My handkerchief. He threw it. I remember. Did I not take it up?	 112.00824571883352
His hand groped vainly in his pockets. No, I didn’t. Better buy one.	 51.99748045401001
He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock,	 43.98870908068615
carefully. For the rest let look who will.	 178.51386656964328
Behind. Perhaps there is someone.	 533.7316742608635
He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant. Moving through the	 54.5107654750862
air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the	 28.219139179441
crosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship.	 50.250656944848025

[ 4 ]	 463.94842625767166
Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls.	 23.55335855308248
He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart,	 100.62031952912645
liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods’ roes. Most of all he	 83.74940141378895
liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of	 63.02941066741569
faintly scented urine.	 213.58557182642582
Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting	 45.13901317932583
her breakfast things on the humpy tray. Gelid light and air were in the	 71.83292867362759
kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere. Made him	 164.70392056645542
feel a bit peckish.	 86.09414603362141
The coals were reddening.	 17.27825353271037
Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right. She didn’t like	 104.59312026669177
her plate full. Right. He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off	 137.30799125604887
the hob and set it sideways on the fire. It sat there, dull and squat,	 44.821006070235356
its spout stuck out. Cup of tea soon. Good. Mouth dry. The cat walked	 220.1340565832065
stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high.	 62.673998149867344
—Mkgnao!	 4.608171674364364
—O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.	 40.13524547942558
The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the	 39.66617945558807
table, mewing. Just how she stalks over my writingtable. Prr. Scratch	 135.931624185308
my head. Prr.	 81.19075016664547
Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form. Clean to see:	 66.58983995253455
the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her	 29.54859609713619
tail, the green flashing eyes. He bent down to her, his hands on his	 79.6170640580007
knees.	 9129.572798767445
—Milk for the pussens, he said.	 33.622800313383145
—Mrkgnao! the cat cried.	 42.34671729240023
They call them stupid. They understand what we say better than we	 84.45331871507356
understand them. She understands all she wants to. Vindictive too.	 164.12981559037968
Cruel. Her nature. Curious mice never squeal. Seem to like it. Wonder	 150.6302581137901
what I look like to her. Height of a tower? No, she can jump me.	 110.00339399692169
—Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly. Afraid of the	 33.116006088852735
chookchooks. I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.	 29.678012863070684
—Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.	 66.2148276083844
She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively	 21.57982720161342
and long, showing him her milkwhite teeth. He watched the dark eyeslits	 55.71529105713836
narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones. Then he went to	 48.0700843537375
the dresser, took the jug Hanlon’s milkman had just filled for him,	 72.79921258822151
poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.	 47.89874351851341
—Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.	 42.70426433288411
He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped	 57.700942264459016
three times and licked lightly. Wonder is it true if you clip them they	 72.6827677764696
can’t mouse after. Why? They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips. Or	 50.779679707630734
kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.	 23.224316151384613
He listened to her licking lap. Ham and eggs, no. No good eggs with	 86.71031000123979
this drouth. Want pure fresh water. Thursday: not a good day either for	 52.457786196172506
a mutton kidney at Buckley’s. Fried with butter, a shake of pepper.	 89.38703941428452
Better a pork kidney at Dlugacz’s. While the kettle is boiling. She	 51.77560247350914
lapped slower, then licking the saucer clean. Why are their tongues so	 61.32935726021416
rough? To lap better, all porous holes. Nothing she can eat? He glanced	 280.5637142160264
round him. No.	 97.28628822023087
On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by	 79.69390051815024
the bedroom door. She might like something tasty. Thin bread and butter	 98.41995619826223
she likes in the morning. Still perhaps: once in a way.	 99.07726501854908
He said softly in the bare hall:	 50.75882979982011
—I’m going round the corner. Be back in a minute.	 82.07193508350191
And when he had heard his voice say it he added:	 96.02120553429437
—You don’t want anything for breakfast?	 32.98004855959804
A sleepy soft grunt answered:	 260.4925699484028
—Mn.	 4.608171674364364
No. She didn’t want anything. He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer,	 97.66752013100154
as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled.	 30.387809613005935
Must get those settled really. Pity. All the way from Gibraltar.	 60.634412513059466
Forgotten any little Spanish she knew. Wonder what her father gave for	 105.54425046495658
it. Old style. Ah yes! of course. Bought it at the governor’s auction.	 75.19153666550558
Got a short knock. Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy. Yes, sir. At	 154.36987365486956
Plevna that was. I rose from the ranks, sir, and I’m proud of it. Still	 69.16020762929041
he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps. Now that was	 64.40982548040203
farseeing.	 4.608171674364364
His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat	 33.20063203849251
and his lost property office secondhand waterproof. Stamps: stickyback	 38.47116831213633
pictures. Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too. Course they do.	 105.12361332951386
The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto’s	 23.951615355300632
high grade ha. He peeped quickly inside the leather headband. White	 42.00577651555241
slip of paper. Quite safe.	 227.39059203496615
On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey. Not there.	 36.61576789695472
In the trousers I left off. Must get it. Potato I have. Creaky	 81.65790444180001
wardrobe. No use disturbing her. She turned over sleepily that time. He	 42.94904167076276
pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf	 106.85125390989775
dropped gently over the threshold, a limp lid. Looked shut. All right	 122.32614713329285
till I come back anyhow.	 230.48954457456537
He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number	 49.038465277244796
seventyfive. The sun was nearing the steeple of George’s church. Be a	 21.804543877232792
warm day I fancy. Specially in these black clothes feel it more. Black	 251.90098955893666
conducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat. But I couldn’t go in	 41.76044465145596
that light suit. Make a picnic of it. His eyelids sank quietly often as	 166.79761951500595
he walked in happy warmth. Boland’s breadvan delivering with trays our	 26.52771493450391
daily but she prefers yesterday’s loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot.	 83.69770778080748
Makes you feel young. Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at	 131.74591017576836
dawn. Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day’s march on him.	 38.872084297946856
Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically. Walk along a	 43.3264943157929
strand, strange land, come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker	 206.97149343657935
too, old Tweedy’s big moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear.	 66.557171914326
Wander through awned streets. Turbaned faces going by. Dark caves of	 164.6807426063208
carpet shops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking	 217.00515576190793
a coiled pipe. Cries of sellers in the streets. Drink water scented	 52.32201445977629
with fennel, sherbet. Dander along all day. Might meet a robber or two.	 50.55995301153098
Well, meet him. Getting on to sundown. The shadows of the mosques among	 33.488828684787244
the pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up. A shiver of the trees,	 29.204668245271964
signal, the evening wind. I pass on. Fading gold sky. A mother watches	 159.7422719287941
me from her doorway. She calls her children home in their dark	 92.22091755113838
language. High wall: beyond strings twanged. Night sky, moon, violet,	 200.2089127634229
colour of Molly’s new garters. Strings. Listen. A girl playing one of	 129.59431227114666
those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers. I pass.	 35.870688487453045
Probably not a bit like it really. Kind of stuff you read: in the track	 49.26233861545196
of the sun. Sunburst on the titlepage. He smiled, pleasing himself.	 28.516193140613755
What Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the _Freeman_	 29.745397789234946
leader: a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway	 11.065136389647185
behind the bank of Ireland. He prolonged his pleased smile. Ikey touch	 80.94909055991711
that: homerule sun rising up in the northwest.	 17.54471122884455
He approached Larry O’Rourke’s. From the cellar grating floated up the	 36.32590471114618
flabby gush of porter. Through the open doorway the bar squirted out	 40.24818616073959
whiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush. Good house, however: just the	 86.57828040068952
end of the city traffic. For instance M’Auley’s down there: n. g. as	 67.2165098775083
position. Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular	 60.874900407371705
from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.	 62.05765743236176
Baldhead over the blind. Cute old codger. No use canvassing him for an	 40.04824239743791
ad. Still he knows his own business best. There he is, sure enough, my	 83.42967909975835
bold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching	 23.961910515676998
the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket. Simon Dedalus takes him	 29.040044377236857
off to a tee with his eyes screwed up. Do you know what I’m going to	 25.90624941907434
tell you? What’s that, Mr O’Rourke? Do you know what? The Russians,	 28.574309773365094
they’d only be an eight o’clock breakfast for the Japanese.	 106.15325197693849
Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps. Sad thing about poor	 94.75800663195807
Dignam, Mr O’Rourke.	 221.0557453227336
Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the	 49.425108721223815
doorway:	 4130.1771016838475
—Good day, Mr O’Rourke.	 43.8676484190945
—Good day to you.	 56.339458379410075
—Lovely weather, sir.	 259.1605153541779
—’Tis all that.	 218.09084554885513
Where do they get the money? Coming up redheaded curates from the	 43.87390815296078
county Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar. Then, lo and	 37.97623362835821
behold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons. Then think	 97.51491634830685
of the competition. General thirst. Good puzzle would be cross Dublin	 138.39327065765406
without passing a pub. Save it they can’t. Off the drunks perhaps. Put	 261.67236683014744
down three and carry five. What is that, a bob here and there, dribs	 111.8398273768965
and drabs. On the wholesale orders perhaps. Doing a double shuffle with	 59.98485340954746
the town travellers. Square it you with the boss and we’ll split the	 109.34509213227989
job, see?	 1883.8895841321878
How much would that tot to off the porter in the month? Say ten barrels	 130.75636380038722
of stuff. Say he got ten per cent off. O more. Fifteen. He passed Saint	 222.75440938016413
Joseph’s National school. Brats’ clamour. Windows open. Fresh air helps	 72.73212436452081
memory. Or a lilt. Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee	 17.177713411173304
doubleyou. Boys are they? Yes. Inishturk. Inishark. Inishboffin. At	 75.58553205764612
their joggerfry. Mine. Slieve Bloom.	 128.66087614621475
He halted before Dlugacz’s window, staring at the hanks of sausages,	 39.15041909407466
polonies, black and white. Fifteen multiplied by. The figures whitened	 40.28161264854903
in his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade. The shiny links,	 42.021704299933596
packed with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the	 33.1384462101849
lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs’ blood.	 26.442129532547355
A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last. He	 50.235250285076866
stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter. Would she buy it too,	 59.12824700089744
calling the items from a slip in her hand? Chapped: washingsoda. And a	 42.37097523105541
pound and a half of Denny’s sausages. His eyes rested on her vigorous	 56.454829415068765
hips. Woods his name is. Wonder what he does. Wife is oldish. New	 106.42217296176575
blood. No followers allowed. Strong pair of arms. Whacking a carpet on	 192.4226037341557
the clothesline. She does whack it, by George. The way her crooked	 74.8833353478094
skirt swings at each whack.	 125.72569901614219
The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with	 44.57390478325307
blotchy fingers, sausagepink. Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.	 64.32924714834957
He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at	 58.248531277616145
Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias. Can become ideal winter	 18.455915994530972
sanatorium. Moses Montefiore. I thought he was. Farmhouse, wall round	 68.21045729389279
it, blurred cattle cropping. He held the page from him: interesting:	 88.672500974049
read it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page	 72.72161711415126
rustling. A young white heifer. Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the	 73.46584529329732
beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the	 79.22255904352434
breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a	 19.226798258958205
palm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there’s a prime one, unpeeled	 69.26505719344078
switches in their hands. He held the page aslant patiently, bending his	 47.96385855548511
senses and his will, his soft subject gaze at rest. The crooked skirt	 171.0192430009452
swinging, whack by whack by whack.	 31.630189260789738
The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime	 44.80710598559021
sausages and made a red grimace.	 102.52248839558062
—Now, my miss, he said.	 125.5136018127688
She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.	 73.73403799931619
—Thank you, my miss. And one shilling threepence change. For you,	 84.37306566694353
please?	 4188.489862735096
Mr Bloom pointed quickly. To catch up and walk behind her if she went	 75.70562559796399
slowly, behind her moving hams. Pleasant to see first thing in the	 135.6582853106883
morning. Hurry up, damn it. Make hay while the sun shines. She stood	 89.47269953753603
outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right. He	 73.95967258365923
sighed down his nose: they never understand. Sodachapped hands. Crusted	 112.49793591201394
toenails too. Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways. The	 48.83074178381696
sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast. For	 32.243451126477204
another: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles’ Lane. They like	 100.89959706890821
them sizeable. Prime sausage. O please, Mr Policeman, I’m lost in the	 83.08086963805371
wood.	 18561.75093746402
—Threepence, please.	 1175.4715148016683
His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.	 49.81080731287446
Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers’ pocket and laid them	 85.3012022107271
on the rubber prickles. They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid,	 76.03920970080524
disc by disc, into the till.	 378.8010542708768
—Thank you, sir. Another time.	 63.43137107555116
A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him. He withdrew his gaze	 60.112590225844265
after an instant. No: better not: another time.	 133.59184252796825
—Good morning, he said, moving away.	 60.81807302192487
—Good morning, sir.	 32.292620761292696
No sign. Gone. What matter?	 263.16476603132696
He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely. Agendath Netaim:	 40.167041777553926
planters’ company. To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish	 102.76631262888394
government and plant with eucalyptus trees. Excellent for shade, fuel	 94.48386148138518
and construction. Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa.	 38.399834176651304
You pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with	 42.57226823978546
olives, oranges, almonds or citrons. Olives cheaper: oranges need	 88.83842643794289
artificial irrigation. Every year you get a sending of the crop. Your	 52.16972384702517
name entered for life as owner in the book of the union. Can pay ten	 69.3774859255732
down and the balance in yearly instalments. Bleibtreustrasse 34,	 24.629225872177617
Berlin, W. 15.	 55.45087921631254
Nothing doing. Still an idea behind it.	 184.74191048473213
He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat. Silverpowdered	 33.72546067552004
olivetrees. Quiet long days: pruning, ripening. Olives are packed in	 73.0651916308177
jars, eh? I have a few left from Andrews. Molly spitting them out.	 59.73702914032825
Knows the taste of them now. Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates.	 48.93549576007033
Citrons too. Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin’s parade. And	 94.27135330848859
Mastiansky with the old cither. Pleasant evenings we had then. Molly in	 155.12294248636272
Citron’s basketchair. Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand,	 125.15314585378778
lift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume. Like that, heavy, sweet,	 191.3462813617322
wild perfume. Always the same, year after year. They fetched high	 179.49577151418663
prices too, Moisel told me. Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant	 92.3971125138951
old times. Must be without a flaw, he said. Coming all that way: Spain,	 51.12035120561216
Gibraltar, Mediterranean, the Levant. Crates lined up on the quayside	 17.71710888255014
at Jaffa, chap ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them	 60.55641949540236
barefoot in soiled dungarees. There’s whatdoyoucallhim out of. How do	 135.31143713624274
you? Doesn’t see. Chap you know just to salute bit of a bore. His back	 127.39657004864986
is like that Norwegian captain’s. Wonder if I’ll meet him today.	 67.11499642268075
Watering cart. To provoke the rain. On earth as it is in heaven.	 77.96343791324459
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly. Grey. Far.	 35.3837680221665
No, not like that. A barren land, bare waste. Vulcanic lake, the dead	 67.74180625126971
sea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth. No wind could lift	 160.2832663160098
those waves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters. Brimstone they called	 90.50057803386272
it raining down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom. All	 32.888108591922546
dead names. A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old. Old now. It bore	 204.2230004403067
the oldest, the first race. A bent hag crossed from Cassidy’s,	 37.125257237084746
clutching a naggin bottle by the neck. The oldest people. Wandered far	 80.73577354635381
away over all the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying,	 92.86249778914727
being born everywhere. It lay there now. Now it could bear no more.	 142.56885835623277
Dead: an old woman’s: the grey sunken cunt of the world.	 52.749719364423555
Desolation.	 4.608171674364364
Grey horror seared his flesh. Folding the page into his pocket he	 62.03608800440143
turned into Eccles street, hurrying homeward. Cold oils slid along his	 58.624266234338975
veins, chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak. Well, I	 88.15716470917226
am here now. Yes, I am here now. Morning mouth bad images. Got up wrong	 117.03265414529811
side of the bed. Must begin again those Sandow’s exercises. On the	 42.96023852281866
hands down. Blotchy brown brick houses. Number eighty still unlet. Why	 208.04164016236027
is that? Valuation is only twentyeight. Towers, Battersby, North,	 71.00911612401374
MacArthur: parlour windows plastered with bills. Plasters on a sore	 99.17386880577426
eye. To smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling	 71.34263809667475
butter. Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh. Yes, yes.	 184.00496768237366
Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, in slim	 184.4027529916177
sandals, along the brightening footpath. Runs, she runs to meet me, a	 41.81730819911578
girl with gold hair on the wind.	 93.74393144696919
Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor. He stooped and gathered	 48.04531842029496
them. Mrs Marion Bloom. His quickened heart slowed at once. Bold hand.	 70.37804617858221
Mrs Marion.	 194.7146081259593
—Poldy!	 4346.298988560709
Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm	 48.01890324355628
yellow twilight towards her tousled head.	 126.2975561054141
—Who are the letters for?	 72.19762888875981
He looked at them. Mullingar. Milly.	 60.98813956400936
—A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you. And	 69.31467236776376
a letter for you.	 77.02688562808066
He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of	 36.08479657446014
her knees.	 214.52296312381392
—Do you want the blind up?	 89.42230373236373
Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her	 124.8569175899582
glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.	 67.32242177023738
—That do? he asked, turning.	 62.506095085913046
She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.	 38.54832785992574
—She got the things, she said.	 78.73349507795301
He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back	 57.39761584937793
slowly with a snug sigh.	 131.86119054096847
—Hurry up with that tea, she said. I’m parched.	 77.10516507387706
—The kettle is boiling, he said.	 20.303048127514522
But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled	 102.47307971208355
linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.	 40.87552555086812
As he went down the kitchen stairs she called:	 34.75697203942211
—Poldy!	 4346.298988560709
—What?	 178.1757147016287
—Scald the teapot.	 56.230868600629954
On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout. He scalded	 28.077920137700243
and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting	 57.24868921752369
the kettle then to let the water flow in. Having set it to draw he took	 109.68270978262606
off the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the	 84.03158642098556
lump of butter slide and melt. While he unwrapped the kidney the cat	 81.23187948247148
mewed hungrily against him. Give her too much meat she won’t mouse. Say	 107.27409899553776
they won’t eat pork. Kosher. Here. He let the bloodsmeared paper fall	 91.11525521673657
to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce. Pepper.	 58.95281961343421
He sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup.	 22.083316422771652
Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over. Thanks:	 73.8839323217125
new tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan’s	 71.88172443163073
seaside girls.	 68.70866081974728
The tea was drawn. He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown Derby,	 82.39780378512884
smiling. Silly Milly’s birthday gift. Only five she was then. No, wait:	 125.49556591442084
four. I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke. Putting pieces of	 65.75370961826899
folded brown paper in the letterbox for her. He smiled, pouring.	 74.446154715766
O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling.	 143.86312239336428
You are my lookingglass from night to morning.	 159.01296146942343
I’d rather have you without a farthing	 80.33011777487218
Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden.	 78.14076721784052
Poor old professor Goodwin. Dreadful old case. Still he was a courteous	 83.20277977435305
old chap. Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform. And	 54.53259034827012
the little mirror in his silk hat. The night Milly brought it into the	 50.08649972262748
parlour. O, look what I found in professor Goodwin’s hat! All we	 241.49188560675802
laughed. Sex breaking out even then. Pert little piece she was.	 154.7123087887093
He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the	 55.623276160761044
teapot on the tray. Its hump bumped as he took it up. Everything on it?	 101.18005839582338
Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream. Yes. He carried it	 136.23970905660647
upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.	 82.34984283164793
Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it	 52.63634950753058
on the chair by the bedhead.	 26.806176542011222
—What a time you were! she said.	 83.95400645307902
She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on	 94.4371626113223
the pillow. He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large	 64.81587750622812
soft bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat’s udder. The	 39.40138538382749
warmth of her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance	 36.02167595749239
of the tea she poured.	 80.88935713245563
A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow. In the	 22.390476989486462
act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.	 41.71106794924424
—Who was the letter from? he asked.	 90.48457179581261
Bold hand. Marion.	 181.33304249537795
—O, Boylan, she said. He’s bringing the programme.	 83.03207323596185
—What are you singing?	 75.07073245859064
—_Là ci darem_ with J. C. Doyle, she said, and _Love’s Old Sweet Song_.	 42.24749201301029
Her full lips, drinking, smiled. Rather stale smell that incense leaves	 188.08957172009895
next day. Like foul flowerwater.	 97.47789155086949
—Would you like the window open a little?	 86.54047433846132
She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking:	 55.333240598901384
—What time is the funeral?	 59.1793465900594
—Eleven, I think, he answered. I didn’t see the paper.	 83.71313614174575
Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled	 88.6760195400451
drawers from the bed. No? Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a	 71.2616093589965
stocking: rumpled, shiny sole.	 73.9411417099865
—No: that book.	 225.57909083149858
Other stocking. Her petticoat.	 175.42469195150312
—It must have fell down, she said.	 58.42655370908134
He felt here and there. _Voglio e non vorrei_. Wonder if she pronounces	 26.2985560272395
that right: _voglio_. Not in the bed. Must have slid down. He stooped	 91.88990852924482
and lifted the valance. The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of	 35.5029110802824
the orangekeyed chamberpot.	 6.922777768218444
—Show here, she said. I put a mark in it. There’s a word I wanted to	 73.64690043967073
ask you.	 214.2205485657066
She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and,	 58.6382669119493
having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the	 33.54890027138805
text with the hairpin till she reached the word.	 40.64790709790328
—Met him what? he asked.	 69.65811272392912
—Here, she said. What does that mean?	 55.78949445505096
He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.	 99.40848578683689
—Metempsychosis?	 6253.152008985971
—Yes. Who’s he when he’s at home?	 123.5974966974625
—Metempsychosis, he said, frowning. It’s Greek: from the Greek. That	 65.565944513417
means the transmigration of souls.	 100.95379786456063
—O, rocks! she said. Tell us in plain words.	 72.10995650087096
He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes. The same young eyes.	 66.02889238161663
The first night after the charades. Dolphin’s Barn. He turned over the	 27.566292682620812
smudged pages. _Ruby: the Pride of the Ring_. Hello. Illustration.	 59.19745003189941
Fierce Italian with carriagewhip. Must be Ruby pride of the on the	 56.04562531239616
floor naked. Sheet kindly lent. _The monster Maffei desisted and flung	 68.85412103295941
his victim from him with an oath_. Cruelty behind it all. Doped	 40.41039247217356
animals. Trapeze at Hengler’s. Had to look the other way. Mob gaping.	 82.2181851668386
Break your neck and we’ll break our sides. Families of them. Bone them	 97.03980601600884
young so they metamspychosis. That we live after death. Our souls. That	 104.07856262097616
a man’s soul after he dies. Dignam’s soul...	 130.85909602224507
—Did you finish it? he asked.	 44.95734008053962
—Yes, she said. There’s nothing smutty in it. Is she in love with the	 51.33555900868712
first fellow all the time?	 100.15853431299995
—Never read it. Do you want another?	 75.63974998619054
—Yes. Get another of Paul de Kock’s. Nice name he has.	 62.01278351783527
She poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways.	 86.34559070107464
Must get that Capel street library book renewed or they’ll write to	 63.08048264885203
Kearney, my guarantor. Reincarnation: that’s the word.	 34.193391012316376
—Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body	 66.06697220122204
after death, that we lived before. They call it reincarnation. That we	 53.02524821269926
all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other	 77.89175754903331
planet. They say we have forgotten it. Some say they remember their	 63.8162802310147
past lives.	 1055.9822367457373
The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea. Better	 86.57213425538404
remind her of the word: metempsychosis. An example would be better. An	 123.57407186428128
example?	 6109.352620258348
The _Bath of the Nymph_ over the bed. Given away with the Easter number	 62.78776951278353
of _Photo Bits_: Splendid masterpiece in art colours. Tea before you	 187.46446989932411
put milk in. Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer. Three and six	 108.91225680122504
I gave for the frame. She said it would look nice over the bed. Naked	 54.3765737610385
nymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then.	 40.08810103960048
He turned the pages back.	 98.13208312690992
—Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it. They	 68.61487727398566
used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for	 67.39714320775937
instance. What they called nymphs, for example.	 151.01725628835857
Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar. She gazed straight before her,	 43.08325928902113
inhaling through her arched nostrils.	 68.73257161329596
—There’s a smell of burn, she said. Did you leave anything on the fire?	 36.65519113943021
—The kidney! he cried suddenly.	 151.84274786300784
He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes	 30.242282278199454
against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping	 174.69909240785336
hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork’s legs. Pungent smoke	 32.77554242908545
shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan. By prodding a prong of	 40.272087874164484
the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its	 76.44573330960084
back. Only a little burnt. He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and	 89.72374405265691
let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it.	 90.46455873070627
Cup of tea now. He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf. He	 94.76684677632792
shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat. Then he put a	 68.11951108052014
forkful into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant	 21.133941912417022
meat. Done to a turn. A mouthful of tea. Then he cut away dies of	 94.97494346674013
bread, sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth. What was that	 47.15674584232476
about some young student and a picnic? He creased out the letter at his	 48.55060957898202
side, reading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in	 80.98296278464792
the gravy and raising it to his mouth.	 82.44008492099812
Dearest Papli	 126.80637487642312
Thanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present. It suits me	 115.01390037671004
splendid. Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam. I got	 93.60976793909967
mummy’s lovely box of creams and am writing. They are lovely. I am	 73.14154002177543
getting on swimming in the photo business now. Mr Coghlan took one of	 101.34760795284878
me and Mrs. Will send when developed. We did great biz yesterday. Fair	 214.2838506262518
day and all the beef to the heels were in. We are going to lough Owel	 42.46849751258388
on Monday with a few friends to make a scrap picnic. Give my love to	 87.60835289452055
mummy and to yourself a big kiss and thanks. I hear them at the piano	 82.06917555929591
downstairs. There is to be a concert in the Greville Arms on Saturday.	 73.93666627730862
There is a young student comes here some evenings named Bannon his	 93.62848296247967
cousins or something are big swells and he sings Boylan’s (I was on the	 61.74745588234561
pop of writing Blazes Boylan’s) song about those seaside girls. Tell	 154.97151800007381
him silly Milly sends my best respects. I must now close with fondest	 66.54035006809735
love	 1289.2335931206333
Your fond daughter	 110.81826948457139
Milly	 4414.8148963618805
P. S. Excuse bad writing am in hurry. Byby.	 62.10279774790866
M.	 3366.7019246785835
Fifteen yesterday. Curious, fifteenth of the month too. Her first	 107.15552778940524
birthday away from home. Separation. Remember the summer morning she	 239.53527165544352
was born, running to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street. Jolly	 73.25466734998103
old woman. Lot of babies she must have helped into the world. She knew	 53.014523291237275
from the first poor little Rudy wouldn’t live. Well, God is good, sir.	 45.30437016711258
She knew at once. He would be eleven now if he had lived.	 46.70831933979028
His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript. Excuse bad writing.	 39.8177805676436
Hurry. Piano downstairs. Coming out of her shell. Row with her in the	 49.758847611987854
XL Café about the bracelet. Wouldn’t eat her cakes or speak or look.	 54.40039470471061
Saucebox. He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece	 55.53088528542952
after piece of kidney. Twelve and six a week. Not much. Still, she	 184.24076868356403
might do worse. Music hall stage. Young student. He drank a draught of	 75.16128599103843
cooler tea to wash down his meal. Then he read the letter again: twice.	 89.79112942437635
O, well: she knows how to mind herself. But if not? No, nothing has	 118.03775222237354
happened. Of course it might. Wait in any case till it does. A wild	 168.45793336384108
piece of goods. Her slim legs running up the staircase. Destiny.	 116.89668972906519
Ripening now. Vain: very.	 131.18635581837543
He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window. Day I caught	 67.62766999509712
her in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red. Anemic a	 47.4778867767357
little. Was given milk too long. On the _Erin’s King_ that day round	 126.87881093583967
the Kish. Damned old tub pitching about. Not a bit funky. Her pale blue	 69.71975235751322
scarf loose in the wind with her hair.	 79.16534632213536
All dimpled cheeks and curls,	 155.1734093835683
Your head it simply swirls.	 48.534959482457765
Seaside girls. Torn envelope. Hands stuck in his trousers’ pockets,	 31.55713380107795
jarvey off for the day, singing. Friend of the family. Swurls, he says.	 85.10932456654115
Pier with lamps, summer evening, band.	 231.42560055978302
Those girls, those girls,	 43.10405480222386
Those lovely seaside girls.	 13.58521916230276
Milly too. Young kisses: the first. Far away now past. Mrs Marion.	 121.49783894974118
Reading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling,	 49.78451149380792
braiding.	 4.608171674364364
A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing. Will	 58.54162062367006
happen, yes. Prevent. Useless: can’t move. Girl’s sweet light lips.	 325.58124351791736
Will happen too. He felt the flowing qualm spread over him. Useless to	 195.57641148805195
move now. Lips kissed, kissing, kissed. Full gluey woman’s lips.	 270.76618911050406
Better where she is down there: away. Occupy her. Wanted a dog to pass	 146.4843009857573
the time. Might take a trip down there. August bank holiday, only two	 93.3167015238744
and six return. Six weeks off, however. Might work a press pass. Or	 184.30333704614463
through M’Coy.	 249.99806228824906
The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper,	 52.21698820905036
nosed at it and stalked to the door. She looked back at him, mewing.	 41.396262139360864
Wants to go out. Wait before a door sometime it will open. Let her	 158.80156025122926
wait. Has the fidgets. Electric. Thunder in the air. Was washing at her	 74.29096035797538
ear with her back to the fire too.	 180.62996301606745
He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels. He stood	 71.62076368482239
up, undoing the waistband of his trousers. The cat mewed to him.	 39.54023060849858
—Miaow! he said in answer. Wait till I’m ready.	 41.51278016212239
Heaviness: hot day coming. Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the	 72.56865699580638
landing.	 18323.67903879946
A paper. He liked to read at stool. Hope no ape comes knocking just as	 87.34396516524102
I’m.	 731.9029102521719
In the tabledrawer he found an old number of _Titbits_. He folded it	 43.518069907211576
under his armpit, went to the door and opened it. The cat went up in	 53.99028776417625
soft bounds. Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.	 47.736655456992395
Listening, he heard her voice:	 135.02870703834884
—Come, come, pussy. Come.	 179.85780061915625
He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen	 35.66971263490248
towards the next garden. No sound. Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry.	 126.07056026800277
The maid was in the garden. Fine morning.	 97.92195047131553
He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall.	 43.07117876400971
Make a summerhouse here. Scarlet runners. Virginia creepers. Want to	 35.831161732374156
manure the whole place over, scabby soil. A coat of liver of sulphur.	 57.24751052788142
All soil like that without dung. Household slops. Loam, what is this	 99.57061596514232
that is? The hens in the next garden: their droppings are very good top	 39.30407018873162
dressing. Best of all though are the cattle, especially when they are	 111.33495373153988
fed on those oilcakes. Mulch of dung. Best thing to clean ladies’ kid	 119.11572974210834
gloves. Dirty cleans. Ashes too. Reclaim the whole place. Grow peas in	 91.41592735248702
that corner there. Lettuce. Always have fresh greens then. Still	 179.57597398521665
gardens have their drawbacks. That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday.	 83.54955586583111
He walked on. Where is my hat, by the way? Must have put it back on the	 35.736496885032224
peg. Or hanging up on the floor. Funny I don’t remember that. Hallstand	 26.05308948791762
too full. Four umbrellas, her raincloak. Picking up the letters.	 98.88332842563415
Drago’s shopbell ringing. Queer I was just thinking that moment. Brown	 89.15067619214147
brillantined hair over his collar. Just had a wash and brushup. Wonder	 131.23645967078608
have I time for a bath this morning. Tara street. Chap in the paybox	 60.75229618359663
there got away James Stephens, they say. O’Brien.	 45.94209247561106
Deep voice that fellow Dlugacz has. Agendath what is it? Now, my miss.	 96.04001811830558
Enthusiast.	 4.608171674364364
He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes. Better be careful not to	 58.57660867246227
get these trousers dirty for the funeral. He went in, bowing his head	 119.49848828017755
under the low lintel. Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy	 29.050524542786444
limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces. Before sitting down he	 49.27520150181936
peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows. The king was in his	 55.31404864551712
countinghouse. Nobody.	 224.56465560343185
Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over	 35.69646493081452
on his bared knees. Something new and easy. No great hurry. Keep it a	 150.45748921250123
bit. Our prize titbit: _Matcham’s Masterstroke_. Written by Mr Philip	 96.85031563266126
Beaufoy, Playgoers’ Club, London. Payment at the rate of one guinea a	 78.59267781447657
column has been made to the writer. Three and a half. Three pounds	 101.61809381087997
three. Three pounds, thirteen and six.	 35.70303165903969
Quietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding	 75.911404539223
but resisting, began the second. Midway, his last resistance yielding,	 69.7318673011832
he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading	 40.7228731190196
still patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone. Hope	 147.73895742801534
it’s not too big bring on piles again. No, just right. So. Ah! Costive.	 123.3923289172171
One tabloid of cascara sagrada. Life might be so. It did not move or	 48.08399081130327
touch him but it was something quick and neat. Print anything now.	 181.77163754251063
Silly season. He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell. Neat	 107.37365613230446
certainly. _Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won	 35.92488316800968
the laughing witch who now_. Begins and ends morally. _Hand in hand_.	 110.77252410800813
Smart. He glanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his	 140.2347015007566
water flow quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and	 167.25233861329062
received payment of three pounds, thirteen and six.	 52.86569502840707
Might manage a sketch. By Mr and Mrs L. M. Bloom. Invent a story for	 115.6082528372714
some proverb. Which? Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what	 83.81437307139478
she said dressing. Dislike dressing together. Nicked myself shaving.	 53.29227890128997
Biting her nether lip, hooking the placket of her skirt. Timing her.	 22.901751250033758
9.15. Did Roberts pay you yet? 9.20. What had Gretta Conroy on? 9.23.	 221.41198940152583
What possessed me to buy this comb? 9.24. I’m swelled after that	 96.03024797236674
cabbage. A speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot.	 127.8896342460165
Rubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf. Morning	 132.3600989973097
after the bazaar dance when May’s band played Ponchielli’s dance of the	 85.05219988933172
hours. Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then	 194.63937670861787
night hours. Washing her teeth. That was the first night. Her head	 119.88222452552183
dancing. Her fansticks clicking. Is that Boylan well off? He has money.	 125.29770355963205
Why? I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing. No use	 83.55118392015854
humming then. Allude to it. Strange kind of music that last night. The	 84.78845001073938
mirror was in shadow. She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen	 76.20380311397841
vest against her full wagging bub. Peering into it. Lines in her eyes.	 82.92518767202903
It wouldn’t pan out somehow.	 148.6102453058541
Evening hours, girls in grey gauze. Night hours then: black with	 218.1916531903684
daggers and eyemasks. Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then	 181.87997844280636
black. Still, true to life also. Day: then the night.	 184.0964923685554
He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it.	 79.10472160798093
Then he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself. He pulled	 52.15095456225676
back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom	 45.97811327419254
into the air.	 86.63524481775393
In the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully	 51.125128920224284
his black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees. What	 106.23773007918093
time is the funeral? Better find out in the paper.	 29.652928196092205
A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up. The bells of George’s	 39.24084770105941
church. They tolled the hour: loud dark iron.	 68.5664953224706
Heigho! Heigho!	 73.30071059716788
Heigho! Heigho!	 73.30071059716788
Heigho! Heigho!	 73.30071059716788
Quarter to. There again: the overtone following through the air. A	 133.8208016051568
third.	 9134.998241446276
Poor Dignam!	 127.84516066227565
[ 5 ]	 463.94842625767166
By lorries along sir John Rogerson’s quay Mr Bloom walked soberly, past	 75.6977561921446
Windmill lane, Leask’s the linseed crusher, the postal telegraph	 26.51654866676637
office. Could have given that address too. And past the sailors’ home.	 141.78513075927162
He turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through	 23.370014500066357
Lime street. By Brady’s cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket	 32.53494974669648
of offal linked, smoking a chewed fagbutt. A smaller girl with scars of	 57.585191333935484
eczema on her forehead eyed him, listlessly holding her battered	 39.9527582215607
caskhoop. Tell him if he smokes he won’t grow. O let him! His life	 82.27249963503259
isn’t such a bed of roses. Waiting outside pubs to bring da home. Come	 216.20795834140318
home to ma, da. Slack hour: won’t be many there. He crossed Townsend	 214.56855745891082
street, passed the frowning face of Bethel. El, yes: house of: Aleph,	 62.811763335185546
Beth. And past Nichols’ the undertaker. At eleven it is. Time enough.	 47.75718171327079
Daresay Corny Kelleher bagged the job for O’Neill’s. Singing with his	 66.51716194588828
eyes shut. Corny. Met her once in the park. In the dark. What a lark.	 63.735816288211815
Police tout. Her name and address she then told with my tooraloom	 143.41842707475647
tooraloom tay. O, surely he bagged it. Bury him cheap in a	 141.2996108584218
whatyoumaycall. With my tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom.	 5.9746555338729515
In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental	 25.630942258308284
Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend,	 42.799285144021084
finest quality, family tea. Rather warm. Tea. Must get some from Tom	 319.083145792599
Kernan. Couldn’t ask him at a funeral, though. While his eyes still	 186.55367864466675
read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent	 40.624797054627344
his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair. Very warm	 70.08906585811187
morning. Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the	 66.51323938993991
leather headband inside his high grade ha. Just there. His right hand	 52.43531913529636
came down into the bowl of his hat. His fingers found quickly a card	 82.34434678472267
behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.	 76.05037148924481
So warm. His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and	 46.14357177566166
hair. Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice	 53.1050992937407
blend, made of the finest Ceylon brands. The far east. Lovely spot it	 70.25058993274567
must be: the garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on,	 124.10805937276724
cactuses, flowery meads, snaky lianas they call them. Wonder is it like	 18.301830655057675
that. Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in _dolce far niente_,	 48.04246539159433
not doing a hand’s turn all day. Sleep six months out of twelve. Too	 130.6066281212469
hot to quarrel. Influence of the climate. Lethargy. Flowers of	 60.508807903696656
idleness. The air feeds most. Azotes. Hothouse in Botanic gardens.	 33.0001086216548
Sensitive plants. Waterlilies. Petals too tired to. Sleeping sickness	 47.783525203331024
in the air. Walk on roseleaves. Imagine trying to eat tripe and	 61.16142773578314
cowheel. Where was the chap I saw in that picture somewhere? Ah yes, in	 38.992665140357765
the dead sea floating on his back, reading a book with a parasol open.	 44.39210191428328
Couldn’t sink if you tried: so thick with salt. Because the weight of	 105.75651690328014
the water, no, the weight of the body in the water is equal to the	 31.788972553581154
weight of the what? Or is it the volume is equal to the weight? It’s a	 57.516603297576665
law something like that. Vance in High school cracking his	 40.075862145909284
fingerjoints, teaching. The college curriculum. Cracking curriculum.	 47.75640654690188
What is weight really when you say the weight? Thirtytwo feet per	 54.19487457080605
second per second. Law of falling bodies: per second per second. They	 24.389978645349828
all fall to the ground. The earth. It’s the force of gravity of the	 45.55486595000542
earth is the weight.	 154.17537256533066
He turned away and sauntered across the road. How did she walk with her	 47.8488910702695
sausages? Like that something. As he walked he took the folded	 122.91790517904495
_Freeman_ from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a	 84.64023787437
baton and tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg.	 81.66167367093266
Careless air: just drop in to see. Per second per second. Per second	 20.6225240531852
for every second it means. From the curbstone he darted a keen glance	 75.3390287928259
through the door of the postoffice. Too late box. Post here. No-one.	 51.07850660295192
In.	 116.11343701418525
He handed the card through the brass grill.	 60.065983754373136
—Are there any letters for me? he asked.	 57.801252750817284
While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting	 20.071551192287604
poster with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his	 91.66438772033165
baton against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper. No answer	 184.4837577352031
probably. Went too far last time.	 189.70762723147976
The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a	 34.12462131637308
letter. He thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope.	 55.56125654194027
Henry Flower Esq,	 50.2824162133396
c/o P. O. Westland Row,	 27.479925475229
City.	 3102.7435259535273
Answered anyhow. He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket,	 149.6566529603982
reviewing again the soldiers on parade. Where’s old Tweedy’s regiment?	 65.38286441512078
Castoff soldier. There: bearskin cap and hackle plume. No, he’s a	 109.5509690057978
grenadier. Pointed cuffs. There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers.	 68.61230930074059
Redcoats. Too showy. That must be why the women go after them. Uniform.	 73.45828146373319
Easier to enlist and drill. Maud Gonne’s letter about taking them off	 28.29988901655547
O’Connell street at night: disgrace to our Irish capital. Griffith’s	 68.63996190004856
paper is on the same tack now: an army rotten with venereal disease:	 107.58025424017985
overseas or halfseasover empire. Half baked they look: hypnotised like.	 105.63916968072114
Eyes front. Mark time. Table: able. Bed: ed. The King’s own. Never see	 145.38472823668448
him dressed up as a fireman or a bobby. A mason, yes.	 42.04396626059854
He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right. Talk: as if	 37.767225772450516
that would mend matters. His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger	 54.46513425758236
felt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks.	 68.90008922157612
Women will pay a lot of heed, I don’t think. His fingers drew forth the	 66.92791107062264
letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket. Something	 181.38732290949292
pinned on: photo perhaps. Hair? No.	 752.1394214764315
M’Coy. Get rid of him quickly. Take me out of my way. Hate company when	 83.34441023322933
you.	 149.54238275787918
—Hello, Bloom. Where are you off to?	 41.04943378955601
—Hello, M’Coy. Nowhere in particular.	 136.21531691616605
—How’s the body?	 227.26690271638145
—Fine. How are you?	 107.47974788612089
—Just keeping alive, M’Coy said.	 141.12179394642936
His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect:	 88.54152055288905
—Is there any... no trouble I hope? I see you’re...	 70.56913319480195
—O, no, Mr Bloom said. Poor Dignam, you know. The funeral is today.	 39.02734629512326
—To be sure, poor fellow. So it is. What time?	 57.41966324371941
A photo it isn’t. A badge maybe.	 320.45419288950677
—E...eleven, Mr Bloom answered.	 25.645195658979926
—I must try to get out there, M’Coy said. Eleven, is it? I only heard	 51.0850647694216
it last night. Who was telling me? Holohan. You know Hoppy?	 46.9151307389822
—I know.	 40.37542279651815
Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door	 18.89362426009404
of the Grosvenor. The porter hoisted the valise up on the well. She	 57.05902128780104
stood still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her,	 239.14357287149122
searched his pockets for change. Stylish kind of coat with that roll	 86.75430069101591
collar, warm for a day like this, looks like blanketcloth. Careless	 111.07315006015872
stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets. Like that haughty	 90.85654529515242
creature at the polo match. Women all for caste till you touch the	 119.46610582954011
spot. Handsome is and handsome does. Reserved about to yield. The	 143.61433663301958
honourable Mrs and Brutus is an honourable man. Possess her once take	 133.52178280504674
the starch out of her.	 17.064208994996083
—I was with Bob Doran, he’s on one of his periodical bends, and what do	 68.2860382350234
you call him Bantam Lyons. Just down there in Conway’s we were.	 62.6918301182445
Doran Lyons in Conway’s. She raised a gloved hand to her hair. In came	 86.48725577620577
Hoppy. Having a wet. Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath	 68.01390085751451
his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the	 45.42965739012336
braided drums. Clearly I can see today. Moisture about gives long sight	 122.61219826506144
perhaps. Talking of one thing or another. Lady’s hand. Which side will	 128.16076812674498
she get up?	 180.489958005866
—And he said: _Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy! What Paddy?_ I	 147.62796597354367
said. _Poor little Paddy Dignam_, he said.	 21.342959298529916
Off to the country: Broadstone probably. High brown boots with laces	 83.56357591187303
dangling. Wellturned foot. What is he foostering over that change for?	 89.62332619816621
Sees me looking. Eye out for other fellow always. Good fallback. Two	 247.13420510634876
strings to her bow.	 162.48933003763196
—_Why?_ I said. _What’s wrong with him?_ I said.	 85.58750008908822
Proud: rich: silk stockings.	 361.1485188663263
—Yes, Mr Bloom said.	 7.834275240214537
He moved a little to the side of M’Coy’s talking head. Getting up in a	 72.00482472008358
minute.	 8435.087991391038
—_What’s wrong with him_? He said. _He’s dead_, he said. And, faith, he	 38.38428681790514
filled up. _Is it Paddy Dignam_? I said. I couldn’t believe it when I	 65.93306891008721
heard it. I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it	 102.80940055385447
in the Arch. _Yes,_ he said. _He’s gone. He died on Monday, poor	 50.00651634270105
fellow_.	 2974.4223156088674
Watch! Watch! Silk flash rich stockings white. Watch!	 421.29679101233586
A heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between.	 38.440574756518245
Lost it. Curse your noisy pugnose. Feels locked out of it. Paradise and	 81.25949110226324
the peri. Always happening like that. The very moment. Girl in Eustace	 47.341135839403826
street hallway Monday was it settling her garter. Her friend covering	 105.74195631339123
the display of. _Esprit de corps_. Well, what are you gaping at?	 22.66340172697041
—Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh. Another gone.	 33.427887050175045
—One of the best, M’Coy said.	 49.0077610769568
The tram passed. They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich	 100.30006391840313
gloved hand on the steel grip. Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her	 19.989643191664143
hat in the sun: flicker, flick.	 40.414154970415694
—Wife well, I suppose? M’Coy’s changed voice said.	 185.88677950593322
—O, yes, Mr Bloom said. Tiptop, thanks.	 22.539183427929483
He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly:	 23.980711456608823
What is home without	 43.94730904293191
Plumtree’s Potted Meat?	 34.86006659649557
Incomplete.	 4.608171674364364
With it an abode of bliss.	 30.366552911030304
—My missus has just got an engagement. At least it’s not settled yet.	 98.45586336861538
Valise tack again. By the way no harm. I’m off that, thanks.	 114.75284803835883
Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness.	 15.269768829158584
—My wife too, he said. She’s going to sing at a swagger affair in the	 55.10986162621009
Ulster Hall, Belfast, on the twentyfifth.	 64.8568333170835
—That so? M’Coy said. Glad to hear that, old man. Who’s getting it up?	 36.393355449054305
Mrs Marion Bloom. Not up yet. Queen was in her bedroom eating bread	 113.33496642748642
and. No book. Blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens.	 91.33611011929565
Dark lady and fair man. Letter. Cat furry black ball. Torn strip of	 174.54216863448522
envelope.	 8452.272430917645
Love’s	 9789.074149952323
Old	 716.8911517265358
Sweet	 5731.5861372960535
Song	 5950.450238807795
Comes lo-ove’s old...	 611.6691898769335
—It’s a kind of a tour, don’t you see, Mr Bloom said thoughtfully.	 40.005271577171825
_Sweeeet song_. There’s a committee formed. Part shares and part	 83.88168318111842
profits.	 4.608171674364364
M’Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble.	 42.56097328846571
—O, well, he said. That’s good news.	 81.74671251278484
He moved to go.	 71.35971172126052
—Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said. Meet you knocking around.	 54.83675292043572
—Yes, Mr Bloom said.	 7.834275240214537
—Tell you what, M’Coy said. You might put down my name at the funeral,	 58.02252375793969
will you? I’d like to go but I mightn’t be able, you see. There’s a	 51.486114252015746
drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself	 85.14078919752225
would have to go down if the body is found. You just shove in my name	 64.50680177383322
if I’m not there, will you?	 84.52981787892041
—I’ll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off. That’ll be all right.	 44.70321753360457
—Right, M’Coy said brightly. Thanks, old man. I’d go if I possibly	 103.52955928858445
could. Well, tolloll. Just C. P. M’Coy will do.	 201.91773360892438
—That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly.	 37.386687812786185
Didn’t catch me napping that wheeze. The quick touch. Soft mark. I’d	 134.66840712650358
like my job. Valise I have a particular fancy for. Leather. Capped	 64.44857021819742
corners, rivetted edges, double action lever lock. Bob Cowley lent him	 93.6716289722071
his for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings	 63.22332438114621
of it from that good day to this.	 94.89706666793674
Mr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled. My missus has	 51.06659726114173
just got an. Reedy freckled soprano. Cheeseparing nose. Nice enough in	 57.774624497394
its way: for a little ballad. No guts in it. You and me, don’t you	 79.90000495119905
know: in the same boat. Softsoaping. Give you the needle that would.	 38.31865345223509
Can’t he hear the difference? Think he’s that way inclined a bit.	 179.68231787471092
Against my grain somehow. Thought that Belfast would fetch him. I hope	 119.60622973326015
that smallpox up there doesn’t get worse. Suppose she wouldn’t let	 89.04487905167075
herself be vaccinated again. Your wife and my wife.	 125.04357577138074
Wonder is he pimping after me?	 67.07332094592667
Mr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured	 22.20689617592508
hoardings. Cantrell and Cochrane’s Ginger Ale (Aromatic). Clery’s	 11.156249786009766
Summer Sale. No, he’s going on straight. Hello. _Leah_ tonight. Mrs	 197.7695470041883
Bandmann Palmer. Like to see her again in that. _Hamlet_ she played	 90.09328040406767
last night. Male impersonator. Perhaps he was a woman. Why Ophelia	 55.65661870115452
committed suicide. Poor papa! How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in	 31.418993611694194
that. Outside the Adelphi in London waited all the afternoon to get in.	 103.67687315574902
Year before I was born that was: sixtyfive. And Ristori in Vienna. What	 36.900295057387645
is this the right name is? By Mosenthal it is. Rachel, is it? No. The	 56.89827860438664
scene he was always talking about where the old blind Abraham	 61.21341775241486
recognises the voice and puts his fingers on his face.	 34.9051652427899
Nathan’s voice! His son’s voice! I hear the voice of Nathan who left	 45.95558681790884
his father to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of	 59.90325460355501
his father and left the God of his father.	 52.941564579296006
Every word is so deep, Leopold.	 232.093413786789
Poor papa! Poor man! I’m glad I didn’t go into the room to look at his	 57.22327835369509
face. That day! O, dear! O, dear! Ffoo! Well, perhaps it was best for	 98.80422136206069
him.	 330.5397417229756
Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the	 36.28366451467209
hazard. No use thinking of it any more. Nosebag time. Wish I hadn’t met	 49.39809509535277
that M’Coy fellow.	 302.37818286617846
He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently	 29.33425022789242
champing teeth. Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid	 228.26303611364818
the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss. Their Eldorado. Poor jugginses! Damn	 74.14903806719386
all they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in	 139.75249018856258
nosebags. Too full for words. Still they get their feed all right and	 59.699141043477276
their doss. Gelded too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp	 41.07124908968432
between their haunches. Might be happy all the same that way. Good poor	 102.85822602822117
brutes they look. Still their neigh can be very irritating.	 178.5183445865009
He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he	 50.763516533205085
carried. Might just walk into her here. The lane is safer.	 215.08631610682818
He passed the cabman’s shelter. Curious the life of drifting cabbies.	 29.616305088359315
All weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own.	 162.99453106274484
_Voglio e non_. Like to give them an odd cigarette. Sociable. Shout a	 58.22481054492911
few flying syllables as they pass. He hummed:	 65.10011623815991
Là ci darem la mano	 27.93623643125543
La la lala la la.	 79.03175654333099
He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in	 57.899039807409196
the lee of the station wall. No-one. Meade’s timberyard. Piled balks.	 44.63845728855595
Ruins and tenements. With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch	 23.287721397876982
court with its forgotten pickeystone. Not a sinner. Near the timberyard	 67.80570777297918
a squatted child at marbles, alone, shooting the taw with a cunnythumb.	 22.22989604862766
A wise tabby, a blinking sphinx, watched from her warm sill. Pity to	 142.78969998502527
disturb them. Mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her.	 119.54744722183383
Open it. And once I played marbles when I went to that old dame’s	 96.67821145697873
school. She liked mignonette. Mrs Ellis’s. And Mr? He opened the letter	 132.62406549659147
within the newspaper.	 600.3284881979114
A flower. I think it’s a. A yellow flower with flattened petals. Not	 87.86526014500419
annoyed then? What does she say?	 64.79943344427423
Dear Henry	 129.76144602484013
I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it. I am sorry	 48.35915906236386
you did not like my last letter. Why did you enclose the stamps? I am	 48.4836054953598
awfully angry with you. I do wish I could punish you for that. I called	 64.90853471144337
you naughty boy because I do not like that other world. Please tell me	 18.828285353981922
what is the real meaning of that word? Are you not happy in your home	 29.200106815874882
you poor little naughty boy? I do wish I could do something for you.	 27.57596411429386
Please tell me what you think of poor me. I often think of the	 57.40133097322063
beautiful name you have. Dear Henry, when will we meet? I think of you	 121.76465538401358
so often you have no idea. I have never felt myself so much drawn to a	 55.94661320267767
man as you. I feel so bad about. Please write me a long letter and tell	 96.40939358810282
me more. Remember if you do not I will punish you. So now you know what	 50.110381459645694
I will do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote. O how I long to	 59.94435760028663
meet you. Henry dear, do not deny my request before my patience are	 122.87417844196905
exhausted. Then I will tell you all. Goodbye now, naughty darling, I	 41.79006361224752
have such a bad headache. today. and write _by return_ to your longing	 86.37356822771207
Martha	 2514.9532064360455
P. S. Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use. I want to	 24.344204626403013
know.	 826.5144975499287
He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell	 172.75230217308348
and placed it in his heart pocket. Language of flowers. They like it	 63.9380089182433
because no-one can hear. Or a poison bouquet to strike him down. Then	 101.81495924133966
walking slowly forward he read the letter again, murmuring here and	 85.46411240338931
there a word. Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your	 95.57938760264692
cactus if you don’t please poor forgetmenot how I long violets to dear	 72.69625462347895
roses when we soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife Martha’s	 215.00038568148975
perfume. Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it	 51.84528941121715
back in his sidepocket.	 75.42950191776865
Weak joy opened his lips. Changed since the first letter. Wonder did	 142.8900431669513
she wrote it herself. Doing the indignant: a girl of good family like	 47.11698048869004
me, respectable character. Could meet one Sunday after the rosary.	 74.23672281623762
Thank you: not having any. Usual love scrimmage. Then running round	 146.02505793895912
corners. Bad as a row with Molly. Cigar has a cooling effect. Narcotic.	 112.70638949573276
Go further next time. Naughty boy: punish: afraid of words, of course.	 63.160301393717496
Brutal, why not? Try it anyhow. A bit at a time.	 82.42634600626894
Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it.	 46.69925315346359
Common pin, eh? He threw it on the road. Out of her clothes somewhere:	 98.84540074897886
pinned together. Queer the number of pins they always have. No roses	 170.24313583784541
without thorns.	 101.69939096606987
Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head. Those two sluts that night in	 87.21079016645298
the Coombe, linked together in the rain.	 69.24098142578548
O, Mairy lost the pin of her drawers.	 47.9338941270917
She didn’t know what to do	 32.1079812138519
To keep it up,	 23.125683331525757
To keep it up.	 23.125683331525757
It? Them. Such a bad headache. Has her roses probably. Or sitting all	 200.89127638745137
day typing. Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves. What perfume does your	 57.475720556609886
wife use. Now could you make out a thing like that?	 113.98346654145097
To keep it up.	 23.125683331525757
Martha, Mary. I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or	 144.13259756964058
faked for money. He is sitting in their house, talking. Mysterious.	 53.867081723569484
Also the two sluts in the Coombe would listen.	 72.59283998752356
To keep it up.	 23.125683331525757
Nice kind of evening feeling. No more wandering about. Just loll there:	 137.4787700228301
quiet dusk: let everything rip. Forget. Tell about places you have	 272.02489413769473
been, strange customs. The other one, jar on her head, was getting the	 83.794495162799
supper: fruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like	 119.681293975218
the hole in the wall at Ashtown. Must carry a paper goblet next time I	 65.76758829929497
go to the trottingmatches. She listens with big dark soft eyes. Tell	 126.72442665278462
her: more and more: all. Then a sigh: silence. Long long long rest.	 122.04097356508866
Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly	 64.73679848541366
in shreds and scattered them towards the road. The shreds fluttered	 21.50965231572729
away, sank in the dank air: a white flutter, then all sank.	 72.5460381502556
Henry Flower. You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the	 31.634945773906338
same way. Simple bit of paper. Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure	 104.03403815956044
cheque for a million in the bank of Ireland. Shows you the money to be	 70.69480143989021
made out of porter. Still the other brother lord Ardilaun has to change	 163.4652979386155
his shirt four times a day, they say. Skin breeds lice or vermin. A	 66.16446859400854
million pounds, wait a moment. Twopence a pint, fourpence a quart,	 109.70965009650727
eightpence a gallon of porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of	 52.606597231946324
porter. One and four into twenty: fifteen about. Yes, exactly. Fifteen	 291.7841126744341
millions of barrels of porter.	 252.828684050601
What am I saying barrels? Gallons. About a million barrels all the	 65.72029695286152
same.	 1466.138987791441
An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach.	 113.41672560287356
Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside. The	 48.48341852255752
bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing	 89.64653678491928
together, winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy	 81.51697725825626
pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.	 39.028073358414105
He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows. Stepping into the	 35.14372973120292
porch he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it	 49.54322852369478
again behind the leather headband. Damn it. I might have tried to work	 60.22273037904867
M’Coy for a pass to Mullingar.	 291.8623104136994
Same notice on the door. Sermon by the very reverend John Conmee S. J.	 19.70834304623946
on saint Peter Claver S. J. and the African Mission. Prayers for the	 28.613237519877153
conversion of Gladstone they had too when he was almost unconscious.	 34.84132063672683
The protestants are the same. Convert Dr William J. Walsh D.D. to the	 44.58706682390769
true religion. Save China’s millions. Wonder how they explain it to the	 111.27942241221936
heathen Chinee. Prefer an ounce of opium. Celestials. Rank heresy for	 18.153795196586646
them. Buddha their god lying on his side in the museum. Taking it easy	 126.04892326243068
with hand under his cheek. Josssticks burning. Not like Ecce Homo.	 70.36665813716387
Crown of thorns and cross. Clever idea Saint Patrick the shamrock.	 80.14140444584409
Chopsticks? Conmee: Martin Cunningham knows him: distinguishedlooking.	 79.82154941417242
Sorry I didn’t work him about getting Molly into the choir instead of	 97.88894331849525
that Father Farley who looked a fool but wasn’t. They’re taught that.	 130.84163188037226
He’s not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to	 44.30029165808015
baptise blacks, is he? The glasses would take their fancy, flashing.	 83.23797421338672
Like to see them sitting round in a ring with blub lips, entranced,	 69.83435342571359
listening. Still life. Lap it up like milk, I suppose.	 175.23322958980282
The cold smell of sacred stone called him. He trod the worn steps,	 65.13894074109999
pushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere.	 40.023970730992914
Something going on: some sodality. Pity so empty. Nice discreet place	 205.2313408500591
to be next some girl. Who is my neighbour? Jammed by the hour to slow	 77.5744262457708
music. That woman at midnight mass. Seventh heaven. Women knelt in the	 118.24923418921514
benches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed. A batch	 66.9914253123666
knelt at the altarrails. The priest went along by them, murmuring,	 73.43010595426844
holding the thing in his hands. He stopped at each, took out a	 85.56900912320931
communion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it	 150.03794979474435
neatly into her mouth. Her hat and head sank. Then the next one. Her	 154.46154226420174
hat sank at once. Then the next one: a small old woman. The priest bent	 135.70649065056315
down to put it into her mouth, murmuring all the time. Latin. The next	 46.858624354289304
one. Shut your eyes and open your mouth. What? _Corpus:_ body. Corpse.	 196.7324891275061
Good idea the Latin. Stupefies them first. Hospice for the dying. They	 119.673867533768
don’t seem to chew it: only swallow it down. Rum idea: eating bits of a	 53.432147321694806
corpse. Why the cannibals cotton to it.	 78.16200294834724
He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by	 52.4257279622711
one, and seek their places. He approached a bench and seated himself in	 116.62963709566277
its corner, nursing his hat and newspaper. These pots we have to wear.	 89.80516086281904
We ought to have hats modelled on our heads. They were about him here	 87.83357684940127
and there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for	 70.43213878695009
it to melt in their stomachs. Something like those mazzoth: it’s that	 71.00868473144749
sort of bread: unleavened shewbread. Look at them. Now I bet it makes	 50.050275894153565
them feel happy. Lollipop. It does. Yes, bread of angels it’s called.	 150.33842795196594
There’s a big idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you	 91.91993376317689
feel. First communicants. Hokypoky penny a lump. Then feel all like one	 223.35964963438042
family party, same in the theatre, all in the same swim. They do. I’m	 178.28637659571424
sure of that. Not so lonely. In our confraternity. Then come out a bit	 86.69736630662759
spreeish. Let off steam. Thing is if you really believe in it. Lourdes	 93.07145968076641
cure, waters of oblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding.	 204.92034601518677
Old fellow asleep near that confessionbox. Hence those snores. Blind	 107.62141556696562
faith. Safe in the arms of kingdom come. Lulls all pain. Wake this time	 124.66968963081291
next year.	 245.7092045958096
He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an	 135.0476079246058
instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace	 87.3609360128962
affair he had on. Suppose he lost the pin of his. He wouldn’t know what	 86.25933432147225
to do to. Bald spot behind. Letters on his back: I.N.R.I? No: I.H.S.	 117.74725414835557
Molly told me one time I asked her. I have sinned: or no: I have	 48.476000247044475
suffered, it is. And the other one? Iron nails ran in.	 73.28952595230605
Meet one Sunday after the rosary. Do not deny my request. Turn up with	 71.9740274103255
a veil and black bag. Dusk and the light behind her. She might be here	 66.10073125749096
with a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on the	 37.81770260517335
sly. Their character. That fellow that turned queen’s evidence on the	 83.27859231898532
invincibles he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion	 100.68590806625816
every morning. This very church. Peter Carey, yes. No, Peter Claver I	 94.62740097638614
am thinking of. Denis Carey. And just imagine that. Wife and six	 81.24848485576341
children at home. And plotting that murder all the time. Those	 95.10555110917421
crawthumpers, now that’s a good name for them, there’s always something	 111.08230814029298
shiftylooking about them. They’re not straight men of business either.	 158.1788789755031
O, no, she’s not here: the flower: no, no. By the way, did I tear up	 91.54422473975113
that envelope? Yes: under the bridge.	 223.3100224576425
The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs	 43.92018628837491
smartly. Wine. Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank	 132.32818463759432
what they are used to Guinness’s porter or some temperance beverage	 46.068419805217445
Wheatley’s Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane’s ginger ale	 25.126462600478508
(aromatic). Doesn’t give them any of it: shew wine: only the other.	 114.6613270276631
Cold comfort. Pious fraud but quite right: otherwise they’d have one	 113.43324806079235
old booser worse than another coming along, cadging for a drink. Queer	 70.09381372518173
the whole atmosphere of the. Quite right. Perfectly right that is.	 53.02183444767302
Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir. Not going to be any music.	 44.50479957753569
Pity. Who has the organ here I wonder? Old Glynn he knew how to make	 97.4872922731104
that instrument talk, the _vibrato_: fifty pounds a year they say he	 97.8375826454263
had in Gardiner street. Molly was in fine voice that day, the _Stabat	 66.28338956210779
Mater_ of Rossini. Father Bernard Vaughan’s sermon first. Christ or	 113.76544362451686
Pilate? Christ, but don’t keep us all night over it. Music they wanted.	 139.95719633233128
Footdrill stopped. Could hear a pin drop. I told her to pitch her voice	 49.23435310644557
against that corner. I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the	 50.72902930901923
people looking up:	 240.02572734857645
_Quis est homo._	 31.339720347449166
Some of that old sacred music splendid. Mercadante: seven last words.	 136.14707538627331
Mozart’s twelfth mass: _Gloria_ in that. Those old popes keen on music,	 113.05885270702858
on art and statues and pictures of all kinds. Palestrina for example	 131.59958367149738
too. They had a gay old time while it lasted. Healthy too, chanting,	 110.49356512749866
regular hours, then brew liqueurs. Benedictine. Green Chartreuse.	 105.3938473708489
Still, having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit thick.	 117.49973605475512
What kind of voice is it? Must be curious to hear after their own	 60.04394190922731
strong basses. Connoisseurs. Suppose they wouldn’t feel anything after.	 175.5764493983975
Kind of a placid. No worry. Fall into flesh, don’t they? Gluttons,	 85.33042988485875
tall, long legs. Who knows? Eunuch. One way out of it.	 69.46869597543093
He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and	 93.62066485088084
bless all the people. All crossed themselves and stood up. Mr Bloom	 108.69968943257959
glanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats. Stand	 75.7631232657969
up at the gospel of course. Then all settled down on their knees again	 56.488091802416555
and he sat back quietly in his bench. The priest came down from the	 44.544098546486104
altar, holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered	 87.23747048920204
each other in Latin. Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a	 64.44235640146807
card:	 25645.966616138776
—O God, our refuge and our strength...	 84.56727707843237
Mr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words. English. Throw them	 59.486772626420105
the bone. I remember slightly. How long since your last mass? Glorious	 196.56110870524742
and immaculate virgin. Joseph, her spouse. Peter and Paul. More	 142.78044109689444
interesting if you understood what it was all about. Wonderful	 99.01591387741131
organisation certainly, goes like clockwork. Confession. Everyone wants	 202.75122060340254
to. Then I will tell you all. Penance. Punish me, please. Great weapon	 102.89598110741258
in their hands. More than doctor or solicitor. Woman dying to. And I	 104.7701818336409
schschschschschsch. And did you chachachachacha? And why did you? Look	 33.65429649797623
down at her ring to find an excuse. Whispering gallery walls have ears.	 119.27766855962284
Husband learn to his surprise. God’s little joke. Then out she comes.	 141.52975568401123
Repentance skindeep. Lovely shame. Pray at an altar. Hail Mary and Holy	 91.82515722785077
Mary. Flowers, incense, candles melting. Hide her blushes. Salvation	 131.27304174280735
army blatant imitation. Reformed prostitute will address the meeting.	 52.70501034088386
How I found the Lord. Squareheaded chaps those must be in Rome: they	 130.18773008116642
work the whole show. And don’t they rake in the money too? Bequests	 117.77000366910444
also: to the P.P. for the time being in his absolute discretion. Masses	 21.234172763100492
for the repose of my soul to be said publicly with open doors.	 56.687806244516686
Monasteries and convents. The priest in that Fermanagh will case in the	 39.687285662334304
witnessbox. No browbeating him. He had his answer pat for everything.	 117.47340196673342
Liberty and exaltation of our holy mother the church. The doctors of	 69.87751397658974
the church: they mapped out the whole theology of it.	 38.48455021177548
The priest prayed:	 47.376850792402514
—Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict. Be our	 64.39821914942925
safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil (may God	 26.177011728099032
restrain him, we humbly pray!): and do thou, O prince of the heavenly	 86.39415041519148
host, by the power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those	 90.62610164191702
other wicked spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of	 18.62489893931071
souls.	 5062.657996430475
The priest and the massboy stood up and walked off. All over. The women	 46.32704426708552
remained behind: thanksgiving.	 61.57660790600946
Better be shoving along. Brother Buzz. Come around with the plate	 97.50617457250458
perhaps. Pay your Easter duty.	 104.09873037672801
He stood up. Hello. Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all the	 71.07597550797658
time? Women enjoy it. Never tell you. But we. Excuse, miss, there’s a	 125.51411738639925
(whh!) just a (whh!) fluff. Or their skirt behind, placket unhooked.	 41.7938121831611
Glimpses of the moon. Annoyed if you don’t. Why didn’t you tell me	 42.303996444954976
before. Still like you better untidy. Good job it wasn’t farther south.	 127.84803073832387
He passed, discreetly buttoning, down the aisle and out through the	 29.104548080388135
main door into the light. He stood a moment unseeing by the cold black	 120.1043960089904
marble bowl while before him and behind two worshippers dipped furtive	 52.94668294556211
hands in the low tide of holy water. Trams: a car of Prescott’s	 61.95051310377167
dyeworks: a widow in her weeds. Notice because I’m in mourning myself.	 82.82244010131386
He covered himself. How goes the time? Quarter past. Time enough yet.	 81.15409473454206
Better get that lotion made up. Where is this? Ah yes, the last time.	 96.37655834357615
Sweny’s in Lincoln place. Chemists rarely move. Their green and gold	 69.14954003766661
beaconjars too heavy to stir. Hamilton Long’s, founded in the year of	 42.67392383945106
the flood. Huguenot churchyard near there. Visit some day.	 105.56656638619523
He walked southward along Westland row. But the recipe is in the other	 36.62893664478916
trousers. O, and I forgot that latchkey too. Bore this funeral affair.	 112.28560289199733
O well, poor fellow, it’s not his fault. When was it I got it made up	 106.09378402142856
last? Wait. I changed a sovereign I remember. First of the month it	 197.97418813464296
must have been or the second. O, he can look it up in the prescriptions	 44.76303708003785
book.	 13817.199736964518
The chemist turned back page after page. Sandy shrivelled smell he	 154.42255004855087
seems to have. Shrunken skull. And old. Quest for the philosopher’s	 40.32308237246712
stone. The alchemists. Drugs age you after mental excitement. Lethargy	 230.18981678275205
then. Why? Reaction. A lifetime in a night. Gradually changes your	 52.4737871798955
character. Living all the day among herbs, ointments, disinfectants.	 90.03677697538501
All his alabaster lilypots. Mortar and pestle. Aq. Dist. Fol. Laur. Te	 13.488474152990907
Virid. Smell almost cure you like the dentist’s doorbell. Doctor Whack.	 64.30904901057595
He ought to physic himself a bit. Electuary or emulsion. The first	 32.96337315417991
fellow that picked an herb to cure himself had a bit of pluck. Simples.	 117.7011245756986
Want to be careful. Enough stuff here to chloroform you. Test: turns	 73.61005330553992
blue litmus paper red. Chloroform. Overdose of laudanum. Sleeping	 83.75677717380997
draughts. Lovephiltres. Paragoric poppysyrup bad for cough. Clogs the	 26.492126317221693
pores or the phlegm. Poisons the only cures. Remedy where you least	 66.38879453356587
expect it. Clever of nature.	 442.1170089245767
—About a fortnight ago, sir?	 197.93558895345888
—Yes, Mr Bloom said.	 7.834275240214537
He waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, the	 71.10478964083427
dusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs. Lot of time taken up telling	 96.86453699035984
your aches and pains.	 113.61204112032753
—Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then	 31.25805190141313
orangeflower water...	 138.94872699428072
It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax.	 148.29086787934932
—And white wax also, he said.	 46.712621010264435
Brings out the darkness of her eyes. Looking at me, the sheet up to her	 101.25988211391713
eyes, Spanish, smelling herself, when I was fixing the links in my	 68.64112276866457
cuffs. Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for the	 36.12835018949992
teeth: nettles and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk.	 28.492310865292982
Skinfood. One of the old queen’s sons, duke of Albany was it? had only	 50.29593242572539
one skin. Leopold, yes. Three we have. Warts, bunions and pimples to	 75.54704263087922
make it worse. But you want a perfume too. What perfume does your?	 62.45352522136591
_Peau d’Espagne_. That orangeflower water is so fresh. Nice smell these	 67.92842938488421
soaps have. Pure curd soap. Time to get a bath round the corner.	 96.10936659357338
Hammam. Turkish. Massage. Dirt gets rolled up in your navel. Nicer if a	 47.03380715579062
nice girl did it. Also I think I. Yes I. Do it in the bath. Curious	 72.41925184149459
longing I. Water to water. Combine business with pleasure. Pity no time	 195.56070493240188
for massage. Feel fresh then all the day. Funeral be rather glum.	 92.03101209000984
—Yes, sir, the chemist said. That was two and nine. Have you brought a	 54.470789172324956
bottle?	 6023.504533177474
—No, Mr Bloom said. Make it up, please. I’ll call later in the day and	 49.2286811527367
I’ll take one of these soaps. How much are they?	 51.273627818155255
—Fourpence, sir.	 1061.2140171015092
Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils. Sweet lemony wax.	 64.92530635122327
—I’ll take this one, he said. That makes three and a penny.	 89.35899684779426
—Yes, sir, the chemist said. You can pay all together, sir, when you	 55.35365848971293
come back.	 101.01289039765865
—Good, Mr Bloom said.	 24.433275087978753
He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the	 27.044008032620003
coolwrappered soap in his left hand.	 37.97522618930409
At his armpit Bantam Lyons’ voice and hand said:	 186.91952881975246
—Hello, Bloom. What’s the best news? Is that today’s? Show us a minute.	 42.11422017436459
Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip. To look	 161.75271451235844
younger. He does look balmy. Younger than I am.	 94.18288515529653
Bantam Lyons’s yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton. Wants a	 191.7383187578913
wash too. Take off the rough dirt. Good morning, have you used Pears’	 213.04364277006923
soap? Dandruff on his shoulders. Scalp wants oiling.	 82.93419525075812
—I want to see about that French horse that’s running today, Bantam	 71.95196705609321
Lyons said. Where the bugger is it?	 93.51100616890257
He rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar.	 31.04032602559011
Barber’s itch. Tight collar he’ll lose his hair. Better leave him the	 63.277544676080666
paper and get shut of him.	 142.26502209641214
—You can keep it, Mr Bloom said.	 22.84256642454455
—Ascot. Gold cup. Wait, Bantam Lyons muttered. Half a mo. Maximum the	 79.95833771906914
second.	 1264.8812746743
—I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.	 15.23352503441351
Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.	 30.443541406287252
—What’s that? his sharp voice said.	 108.30375461892919
—I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered. I was going to throw it away	 23.750736465436912
that moment.	 198.44364469527187
Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread	 30.29830526330584
sheets back on Mr Bloom’s arms.	 119.86040425145235
—I’ll risk it, he said. Here, thanks.	 79.01326295912008
He sped off towards Conway’s corner. God speed scut.	 69.36441863785912
Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap	 46.89901904365247
in it, smiling. Silly lips of that chap. Betting. Regular hotbed of it	 84.21552568412342
lately. Messenger boys stealing to put on sixpence. Raffle for large	 125.71477279697542
tender turkey. Your Christmas dinner for threepence. Jack Fleming	 150.762327903038
embezzling to gamble then smuggled off to America. Keeps a hotel now.	 134.46650140265947
They never come back. Fleshpots of Egypt.	 87.324372750445
He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths. Remind you of a	 18.79949774064631
mosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets. College sports today I see. He	 29.719852515899074
eyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist	 47.34080910865318
doubled up like a cod in a pot. Damn bad ad. Now if they had made it	 53.07095612726318
round like a wheel. Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the	 42.94569085320917
hub big: college. Something to catch the eye.	 192.38668881716762
There’s Hornblower standing at the porter’s lodge. Keep him on hands:	 69.92863251850744
might take a turn in there on the nod. How do you do, Mr Hornblower?	 59.014408415936025
How do you do, sir?	 20.287721620105867
Heavenly weather really. If life was always like that. Cricket weather.	 168.1365696301083
Sit around under sunshades. Over after over. Out. They can’t play it	 286.65313850649034
here. Duck for six wickets. Still Captain Culler broke a window in the	 102.25930264586896
Kildare street club with a slog to square leg. Donnybrook fair more in	 81.71472278694347
their line. And the skulls we were acracking when M’Carthy took the	 96.76501352048315
floor. Heatwave. Won’t last. Always passing, the stream of life, which	 192.78582770169896
in the stream of life we trace is dearer than them all.	 35.361644504083905
Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid	 149.8344873352874
stream. This is my body.	 235.6114433591367
He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of	 52.99690994897618
warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved. He saw his trunk	 111.23312069138733
and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward,	 100.60638133046336
lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of	 21.697632200158687
his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father	 165.21896884892138
of thousands, a languid floating flower.	 175.16718551619007
[ 6 ]	 463.94842625767166
Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking	 81.10966613415866
carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself. Mr Power stepped in	 78.05380865018621
after him, curving his height with care.	 90.0801007843722
—Come on, Simon.	 100.73605184820055
—After you, Mr Bloom said.	 36.18782793715306
Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying:	 78.92590171339052
—Yes, yes.	 51.775750238693824
—Are we all here now? Martin Cunningham asked. Come along, Bloom.	 58.49324898713873
Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place. He pulled the door to	 59.61390334119442
after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight. He passed an arm	 84.68360823505085
through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow	 31.9606892101215
at the lowered blinds of the avenue. One dragged aside: an old woman	 42.02476316476001
peeping. Nose whiteflattened against the pane. Thanking her stars she	 66.23560952857258
was passed over. Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse. Glad	 139.58939178170297
to see us go we give them such trouble coming. Job seems to suit them.	 85.37876154330925
Huggermugger in corners. Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he’d	 47.18776618120171
wake. Then getting it ready. Laying it out. Molly and Mrs Fleming	 94.15252769631637
making the bed. Pull it more to your side. Our windingsheet. Never know	 143.13390237109797
who will touch you dead. Wash and shampoo. I believe they clip the	 65.01611081445827
nails and the hair. Keep a bit in an envelope. Grows all the same	 109.91691648010843
after. Unclean job.	 434.2829988469279
All waited. Nothing was said. Stowing in the wreaths probably. I am	 84.61607553431284
sitting on something hard. Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket. Better	 94.26368850020985
shift it out of that. Wait for an opportunity.	 78.94029131433952
All waited. Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer:	 263.660557464123
then horses’ hoofs. A jolt. Their carriage began to move, creaking and	 73.6725298615059
swaying. Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind. The blinds of	 66.09659123265422
the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar.	 89.64553839586947
At walking pace.	 236.86443945181352
They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were	 127.13557633243899
passing along the tramtracks. Tritonville road. Quicker. The wheels	 60.34508855666467
rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook	 56.32908716963908
rattling in the doorframes.	 58.71561609708912
—What way is he taking us? Mr Power asked through both windows.	 118.23149550309208
—Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said. Ringsend. Brunswick street.	 10.169715111163478
Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.	 30.48152219290139
—That’s a fine old custom, he said. I am glad to see it has not died	 52.64092593653901
out.	 536.8554774050247
All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by	 219.35566922522915
passers. Respect. The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the	 30.387312575911615
smoother road past Watery lane. Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man,	 99.12986911262166
clad in mourning, a wide hat.	 67.9999749965903
—There’s a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.	 106.67775436835512
—Who is that?	 32.8634908728029
—Your son and heir.	 119.60738526786753
—Where is he? Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.	 40.48869626183207
The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway	 25.458087349229377
before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back	 48.73540434711919
to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels. Mr Dedalus	 54.19663996805759
fell back, saying:	 783.6121325243339
—Was that Mulligan cad with him? His _fidus Achates_!	 34.55963149174642
—No, Mr Bloom said. He was alone.	 32.522789618109385
—Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding	 59.0165696422739
faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa’s little lump	 46.01710270523084
of dung, the wise child that knows her own father.	 120.8810592373051
Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road. Wallace Bros: the	 36.90361638631576
bottleworks: Dodder bridge.	 35.532872428625566
Richie Goulding and the legal bag. Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls	 39.21805190108611
the firm. His jokes are getting a bit damp. Great card he was. Waltzing	 105.47999695568521
in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the	 49.51355614967636
landlady’s two hats pinned on his head. Out on the rampage all night.	 20.41825916009894
Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear. Wife	 118.31073267472615
ironing his back. Thinks he’ll cure it with pills. All breadcrumbs they	 48.87301503921348
are. About six hundred per cent profit.	 95.60323869482627
—He’s in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled. That Mulligan is a	 81.83566722692763
contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts. His name stinks	 64.30226590055669
all over Dublin. But with the help of God and His blessed mother I’ll	 74.69949519809933
make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother	 70.9804126630447
or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a	 68.35724125220221
gate. I’ll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.	 219.38627287382423
He cried above the clatter of the wheels:	 28.8333367286832
—I won’t have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son. A counterjumper’s	 42.88707607061846
son. Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M’Swiney’s. Not likely.	 68.89053235194504
He ceased. Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power’s mild	 40.1491933945533
face and Martin Cunningham’s eyes and beard, gravely shaking. Noisy	 198.11149539920498
selfwilled man. Full of his son. He is right. Something to hand on. If	 135.9480403252416
little Rudy had lived. See him grow up. Hear his voice in the house.	 77.99468618861559
Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit. My son. Me in his eyes. Strange	 99.61024895131523
feeling it would be. From me. Just a chance. Must have been that	 81.82105301142226
morning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs	 50.75169701436442
at it by the wall of the cease to do evil. And the sergeant grinning	 42.19099868056359
up. She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched. Give us	 169.84170604941644
a touch, Poldy. God, I’m dying for it. How life begins.	 209.8551376053374
Got big then. Had to refuse the Greystones concert. My son inside her.	 140.26631379628745
I could have helped him on in life. I could. Make him independent.	 49.33030620605832
Learn German too.	 374.2290100574793
—Are we late? Mr Power asked.	 35.270610029470774
—Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.	 47.3853881078781
Molly. Milly. Same thing watered down. Her tomboy oaths. O jumping	 136.27927540930568
Jupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she’s a dear girl. Soon be a	 64.66796095647197
woman. Mullingar. Dearest Papli. Young student. Yes, yes: a woman too.	 86.35421089390088
Life, life.	 566.0038542126824
The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.	 126.86014303501207
—Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.	 51.83383410877196
—He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn’t that squint troubling him. Do	 43.64200088203214
you follow me?	 91.1808627358194
He closed his left eye. Martin Cunningham began to brush away	 23.478652060982782
crustcrumbs from under his thighs.	 32.74381392031642
—What is this, he said, in the name of God? Crumbs?	 22.03219835913569
—Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power	 54.14737170382385
said.	 674.7359038427248
All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless	 42.23179461738649
leather of the seats. Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward	 57.0076803345346
and said:	 122.77428401338109
—Unless I’m greatly mistaken. What do you think, Martin?	 48.847350475962415
—It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.	 44.89196224370947
Mr Bloom set his thigh down. Glad I took that bath. Feel my feet quite	 105.83303426208838
clean. But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.	 227.97831710001162
Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.	 18.426080005215642
—After all, he said, it’s the most natural thing in the world.	 32.76535095802021
—Did Tom Kernan turn up? Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of	 21.223333289468304
his beard gently.	 86.7928733732359
—Yes, Mr Bloom answered. He’s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.	 56.456797538138154
—And Corny Kelleher himself? Mr Power asked.	 25.1065350135739
—At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.	 29.446528361092817
—I met M’Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said. He said he’d try to come.	 28.364681468627612
The carriage halted short.	 56.74296452339673
—What’s wrong?	 56.02246855667077
—We’re stopped.	 925.6139641182432
—Where are we?	 75.40370135900108
Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.	 19.82431250137446
—The grand canal, he said.	 29.205611695058266
Gasworks. Whooping cough they say it cures. Good job Milly never got	 78.61402826419793
it. Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions. Shame	 142.5329035882953
really. Got off lightly with illnesses compared. Only measles. Flaxseed	 90.97760407781722
tea. Scarlatina, influenza epidemics. Canvassing for death. Don’t miss	 73.44352372632795
this chance. Dogs’ home over there. Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos,	 103.05765681368842
Leopold, is my last wish. Thy will be done. We obey them in the grave.	 60.03440291489002
A dying scrawl. He took it to heart, pined away. Quiet brute. Old men’s	 93.88743115939857
dogs usually are.	 316.07319933208566
A raindrop spat on his hat. He drew back and saw an instant of shower	 18.311890746325442
spray dots over the grey flags. Apart. Curious. Like through a	 57.157457963463436
colander. I thought it would. My boots were creaking I remember now.	 97.24203788296997
—The weather is changing, he said quietly.	 53.72128017691377
—A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.	 73.01584560475996
—Wanted for the country, Mr Power said. There’s the sun again coming	 64.08011827356928
out.	 536.8554774050247
Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled	 51.77615108422652
a mute curse at the sky.	 124.34839900038834
—It’s as uncertain as a child’s bottom, he said.	 42.80666876444528
—We’re off again.	 499.7080069184414
The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed	 70.11401287022576
gently. Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.	 119.61752927382169
—Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said. And Paddy Leonard taking	 42.248615917786935
him off to his face.	 94.65934862653718
—O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly. Wait till you hear	 52.95636176477965
him, Simon, on Ben Dollard’s singing of _The Croppy Boy_.	 100.61284487910272
—Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously. _His singing of that simple	 59.85305491715577
ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the	 57.95685811972361
whole course of my experience._	 153.95721035842843
—Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing. He’s dead nuts on that. And the	 15.224119489312226
retrospective arrangement.	 133.72607750086735
—Did you read Dan Dawson’s speech? Martin Cunningham asked.	 68.1303627442674
—I did not then, Mr Dedalus said. Where is it?	 41.14093832064566
—In the paper this morning.	 57.63667186863937
Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. That book I must change	 48.86102210884048
for her.	 85.90148447531894
—No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly. Later on please.	 41.643231184722396
Mr Bloom’s glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the	 34.466686957576535
deaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what	 36.58799698242487
Peake is that? is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne’s? no, Sexton,	 30.009235280097272
Urbright. Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.	 35.24545660370804
Thanks to the Little Flower. Sadly missed. To the inexpressible grief	 82.34431882356729
of his. Aged 88 after a long and tedious illness. Month’s mind:	 53.6062888154529
Quinlan. On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.	 224.5275692216899
It is now a month since dear Henry fled	 156.78707558427743
To his home up above in the sky	 196.3338910956926
While his family weeps and mourns his loss	 76.74744956058464
Hoping some day to meet him on high.	 145.91155175559726
I tore up the envelope? Yes. Where did I put her letter after I read it	 87.47609233370358
in the bath? He patted his waistcoatpocket. There all right. Dear Henry	 36.2957066337072
fled. Before my patience are exhausted.	 60.61574629827457
National school. Meade’s yard. The hazard. Only two there now. Nodding.	 137.8733210459736
Full as a tick. Too much bone in their skulls. The other trotting round	 64.80346491576994
with a fare. An hour ago I was passing there. The jarvies raised their	 80.86511531252405
hats.	 15957.18943640877
A pointsman’s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a	 94.04553174075906
tramway standard by Mr Bloom’s window. Couldn’t they invent something	 173.68559367519987
automatic so that the wheel itself much handier? Well but that fellow	 90.88235059094433
would lose his job then? Well but then another fellow would get a job	 147.05053673080246
making the new invention?	 123.31814760377544
Antient concert rooms. Nothing on there. A man in a buff suit with a	 49.364074933603035
crape armlet. Not much grief there. Quarter mourning. People in law	 136.53264163003175
perhaps.	 3260.0337285126466
They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark’s, under the railway	 21.78035606015799
bridge, past the Queen’s theatre: in silence. Hoardings: Eugene	 91.25152286463518
Stratton, Mrs Bandmann Palmer. Could I go to see _Leah_ tonight, I	 75.08199069061666
wonder. I said I. Or the _Lily of Killarney_? Elster Grimes Opera	 115.12747758518482
Company. Big powerful change. Wet bright bills for next week. _Fun on	 214.74270071641956
the Bristol_. Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety. Have	 65.48915208420215
to stand a drink or two. As broad as it’s long.	 142.55828721262935
He’s coming in the afternoon. Her songs.	 183.670815432431
Plasto’s. Sir Philip Crampton’s memorial fountain bust. Who was he?	 57.45634861758205
—How do you do? Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in	 23.763967532362184
salute.	 8592.805663192214
—He doesn’t see us, Mr Power said. Yes, he does. How do you do?	 24.0575971962632
—Who? Mr Dedalus asked.	 62.786283096183375
—Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said. There he is airing his quiff.	 31.48062921503386
Just that moment I was thinking.	 88.68788123876085
Mr Dedalus bent across to salute. From the door of the Red Bank the	 25.070226113153282
white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.	 83.14395561667523
Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right	 59.80397540947773
hand. The nails, yes. Is there anything more in him that they she sees?	 212.83857933758478
Fascination. Worst man in Dublin. That keeps him alive. They sometimes	 120.29373215665314
feel what a person is. Instinct. But a type like that. My nails. I am	 92.94221028735049
just looking at them: well pared. And after: thinking alone. Body	 176.85154509795188
getting a bit softy. I would notice that: from remembering. What causes	 81.65252391622246
that? I suppose the skin can’t contract quickly enough when the flesh	 159.14254967154503
falls off. But the shape is there. The shape is there still. Shoulders.	 154.07207019714912
Hips. Plump. Night of the dance dressing. Shift stuck between the	 183.3245385163482
cheeks behind.	 1547.3599646106084
He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant	 59.43957825051727
glance over their faces.	 134.23096012724596
Mr Power asked:	 27.87304281426437
—How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?	 62.89016637348419
—O, very well, Mr Bloom said. I hear great accounts of it. It’s a good	 35.635731003929884
idea, you see...	 112.2842298537208
—Are you going yourself?	 47.61332814994567
—Well no, Mr Bloom said. In point of fact I have to go down to the	 26.839039176430465
county Clare on some private business. You see the idea is to tour the	 96.56332331842347
chief towns. What you lose on one you can make up on the other.	 104.28868159312091
—Quite so, Martin Cunningham said. Mary Anderson is up there now.	 82.37466288815672
Have you good artists?	 55.58770960507547
—Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said. O yes, we’ll have all	 45.69833218721132
topnobbers. J. C. Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and. The best, in	 72.39723341446053
fact.	 16104.56723004959
—And _Madame_, Mr Power said smiling. Last but not least.	 82.48372483323337
Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and	 25.09207218762419
clasped them. Smith O’Brien. Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there.	 116.4854342559291
Woman. Must be his deathday. For many happy returns. The carriage	 107.9458678117395
wheeling by Farrell’s statue united noiselessly their unresisting	 37.78682947314774
knees.	 9129.572798767445
Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his	 29.745789800007135
mouth opening: oot.	 132.22835517893367
—Four bootlaces for a penny.	 51.95194990165025
Wonder why he was struck off the rolls. Had his office in Hume street.	 68.25562224377612
Same house as Molly’s namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford.	 131.42321615278345
Has that silk hat ever since. Relics of old decency. Mourning too.	 108.66814839634417
Terrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake.	 169.55672249222545
O’Callaghan on his last legs.	 53.173869560548056
And _Madame_. Twenty past eleven. Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean. Doing	 179.4576342706898
her hair, humming: _voglio e non vorrei_. No: _vorrei e non_. Looking	 36.82451398047651
at the tips of her hairs to see if they are split. _Mi trema un poco	 25.739318392279163
il_. Beautiful on that _tre_ her voice is: weeping tone. A thrush. A	 106.59351538973532
throstle. There is a word throstle that expresses that.	 30.669362209015443
His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power’s goodlooking face. Greyish over	 67.10706019617592
the ears. _Madame_: smiling. I smiled back. A smile goes a long way.	 139.5872892927687
Only politeness perhaps. Nice fellow. Who knows is that true about the	 86.0620799510785
woman he keeps? Not pleasant for the wife. Yet they say, who was it	 67.42347347202694
told me, there is no carnal. You would imagine that would get played	 69.60712861588263
out pretty quick. Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her	 104.07660931760235
a pound of rumpsteak. What is this she was? Barmaid in Jury’s. Or the	 34.18572059372957
Moira, was it?	 30.050561419702973
They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator’s form.	 37.73410204703765
Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.	 36.53072975720075
—Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.	 31.754308201157617
A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner	 80.24337235534297
of Elvery’s Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his	 29.268402081145783
spine.	 4.608171674364364
—In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.	 46.83455781609646
Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:	 40.1479725858518
—The devil break the hasp of your back!	 46.64142006560206
Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as	 46.23570420566018
the carriage passed Gray’s statue.	 148.15866237529764
—We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.	 36.503057710885024
His eyes met Mr Bloom’s eyes. He caressed his beard, adding:	 43.378322225976866
—Well, nearly all of us.	 189.89598369600702
Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions’ faces.	 33.64486116341558
—That’s an awfully good one that’s going the rounds about Reuben J and	 75.83758815034082
the son.	 86.79687478911175
—About the boatman? Mr Power asked.	 45.693035016524654
—Yes. Isn’t it awfully good?	 42.92470908711456
—What is that? Mr Dedalus asked. I didn’t hear it.	 18.87125711027964
—There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to	 25.52756063211939
send him to the Isle of Man out of harm’s way but when they were	 40.543469102232116
both.....	 4928.0374648439
—What? Mr Dedalus asked. That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?	 48.80284128106837
—Yes, Mr Bloom said. They were both on the way to the boat and he tried	 35.245275661537036
to drown.....	 29.86908918584726
—Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried. I wish to Christ he did!	 46.32811688834981
Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.	 61.21799226551378
—No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself.....	 36.3239586926685
Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:	 39.888693869918455
—Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on	 84.80743526502171
their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got	 74.33830204136241
loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.	 122.13234769134336
—For God’s sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright. Is he dead?	 59.31570516510578
—Dead! Martin Cunningham cried. Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished	 80.40632900795637
him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father	 48.81253837896719
on the quay more dead than alive. Half the town was there.	 132.92208126045134
—Yes, Mr Bloom said. But the funny part is.....	 38.25439292944292
—And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for	 50.074461772576576
saving his son’s life.	 43.87626223674189
A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power’s hand.	 64.6010611636096
—O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed. Like a hero. A silver florin.	 63.40764300373881
—Isn’t it awfully good? Mr Bloom said eagerly.	 34.184380220900934
—One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.	 15.526225991162928
Mr Power’s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.	 58.573309542307605
Nelson’s pillar.	 127.6959148256438
—Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!	 82.29785047485586
—We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.	 32.35484967358666
Mr Dedalus sighed.	 23.061634729910462
—Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn’t grudge us a laugh.	 71.47456920007458
Many a good one he told himself.	 72.886196537493
—The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his	 34.567899055233134
fingers. Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last	 119.66169074775658
and he was in his usual health that I’d be driving after him like this.	 71.94193681823154
He’s gone from us.	 54.158664829791924
—As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said. He went	 61.50445630658569
very suddenly.	 1061.5372306652846
—Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said. Heart.	 38.56265715440742
He tapped his chest sadly.	 71.70378390789196
Blazing face: redhot. Too much John Barleycorn. Cure for a red nose.	 54.19519532549536
Drink like the devil till it turns adelite. A lot of money he spent	 120.31266997716226
colouring it.	 31.839927380285154
Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.	 38.56686080739052
—He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.	 82.55226045393947
—The best death, Mr Bloom said.	 23.349331312473634
Their wide open eyes looked at him.	 200.5888159110981
—No suffering, he said. A moment and all is over. Like dying in sleep.	 90.91667019146726
No-one spoke.	 237.46640597130647
Dead side of the street this. Dull business by day, land agents,	 103.00727062662132
temperance hotel, Falconer’s railway guide, civil service college,	 381.28038907735686
Gill’s, catholic club, the industrious blind. Why? Some reason. Sun or	 255.10794211672672
wind. At night too. Chummies and slaveys. Under the patronage of the	 28.265365574080086
late Father Mathew. Foundation stone for Parnell. Breakdown. Heart.	 293.19700842964977
White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner,	 50.06424608328542
galloping. A tiny coffin flashed by. In a hurry to bury. A mourning	 82.54565778616612
coach. Unmarried. Black for the married. Piebald for bachelors. Dun for	 79.33257877557296
a nun.	 205.4434371554861
—Sad, Martin Cunningham said. A child.	 45.25621450533669
A dwarf’s face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy’s was. Dwarf’s	 57.90723965546052
body, weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box. Burial friendly society	 56.127923405245134
pays. Penny a week for a sod of turf. Our. Little. Beggar. Baby. Meant	 89.52393258692285
nothing. Mistake of nature. If it’s healthy it’s from the mother. If	 120.34632430801265
not from the man. Better luck next time.	 103.35860412721138
—Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said. It’s well out of it.	 38.676167876946316
The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square. Rattle his	 63.13915842279259
bones. Over the stones. Only a pauper. Nobody owns.	 106.28982793748429
—In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.	 20.005774671891825
—But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own	 43.75848662814001
life.	 1040.235324093293
Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.	 30.662347210140297
—The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.	 38.82710925008475
—Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively. We	 12.415222846535022
must take a charitable view of it.	 48.061436272250674
—They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.	 22.49576314444096
—It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.	 37.516733337671035
Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again. Martin Cunningham’s	 105.6333563960092
large eyes. Looking away now. Sympathetic human man he is. Intelligent.	 151.76876700632585
Like Shakespeare’s face. Always a good word to say. They have no mercy	 59.24066533794082
on that here or infanticide. Refuse christian burial. They used to	 84.3460699454353
drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave. As if it wasn’t	 77.22307052020578
broken already. Yet sometimes they repent too late. Found in the	 98.87276172535836
riverbed clutching rushes. He looked at me. And that awful drunkard of	 59.50622029686984
a wife of his. Setting up house for her time after time and then	 130.61725809624738
pawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost. Leading him the	 34.13175457519985
life of the damned. Wear the heart out of a stone, that. Monday	 96.21044832857852
morning. Start afresh. Shoulder to the wheel. Lord, she must have	 104.91452793816788
looked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in there. Drunk about	 137.03311501354472
the place and capering with Martin’s umbrella.	 56.785873545362364
And they call me the jewel of Asia,	 20.767413264947162
Of Asia,	 19.14104210176948
The geisha.	 7.77559996992721
He looked away from me. He knows. Rattle his bones.	 51.459687087694846
That afternoon of the inquest. The redlabelled bottle on the table. The	 44.0343903115179
room in the hotel with hunting pictures. Stuffy it was. Sunlight	 123.54223809883294
through the slats of the Venetian blind. The coroner’s sunlit ears, big	 32.961341891182705
and hairy. Boots giving evidence. Thought he was asleep first. Then saw	 170.5446427317929
like yellow streaks on his face. Had slipped down to the foot of the	 33.22427234541316
bed. Verdict: overdose. Death by misadventure. The letter. For my son	 93.34326635232856
Leopold.	 2126.232617436416
No more pain. Wake no more. Nobody owns.	 50.80866968510555
The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street. Over the stones.	 44.32371306027631
—We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.	 43.91969267010281
—God grant he doesn’t upset us on the road, Mr Power said.	 54.129523684108534
—I hope not, Martin Cunningham said. That will be a great race tomorrow	 37.77098030564124
in Germany. The Gordon Bennett.	 50.922441598620125
—Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said. That will be worth seeing, faith.	 63.24700078728511
As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent	 46.865833952641445
over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls. Has	 100.50250206037053
anybody here seen Kelly? Kay ee double ell wy. Dead March from _Saul._	 103.72641613509145
He’s as bad as old Antonio. He left me on my ownio. Pirouette! The	 37.85442664111699
_Mater Misericordiae_. Eccles street. My house down there. Big place.	 244.28125993352356
Ward for incurables there. Very encouraging. Our Lady’s Hospice for the	 62.88586895522254
dying. Deadhouse handy underneath. Where old Mrs Riordan died. They	 159.90584736905348
look terrible the women. Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the	 134.3822718546829
spoon. Then the screen round her bed for her to die. Nice young student	 155.88475183443492
that was dressed that bite the bee gave me. He’s gone over to the	 68.50909676736674
lying-in hospital they told me. From one extreme to the other.	 57.6528752539691
The carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.	 54.04740227666321
—What’s wrong now?	 64.1037557752169
A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching	 99.25907180844813
by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony	 99.03350006988926
croups. Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their	 173.08375101389157
fear.	 6342.865771034647
—Emigrants, Mr Power said.	 14.279043527561011
—Huuuh! the drover’s voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.	 19.791150103063003
Huuuh! out of that!	 22.095078525936163
Thursday, of course. Tomorrow is killing day. Springers. Cuffe sold	 89.91811081816498
them about twentyseven quid each. For Liverpool probably. Roastbeef for	 185.33851250444272
old England. They buy up all the juicy ones. And then the fifth quarter	 58.05291272065896
lost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns. Comes to a big thing in a	 110.35643566544807
year. Dead meat trade. Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries,	 76.33660363595392
soap, margarine. Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off	 300.2743554174692
the train at Clonsilla.	 38.825934376913374
The carriage moved on through the drove.	 67.37821468516498
—I can’t make out why the corporation doesn’t run a tramline from the	 79.124898341708
parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said. All those animals could be taken	 26.918501884778156
in trucks down to the boats.	 23.34509660797074
—Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said. Quite	 63.712125793807104
right. They ought to.	 68.99623847349102
—Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have	 29.228698976919436
municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know. Run the line	 128.22668414430808
out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage	 97.66049139742894
and all. Don’t you see what I mean?	 39.37600232964087
—O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said. Pullman car and saloon	 69.92249938393827
diningroom.	 4.608171674364364
—A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.	 72.39127729770448
—Why? Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus. Wouldn’t it be more decent	 59.20595238124554
than galloping two abreast?	 97.24783435124931
—Well, there’s something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.	 67.67538973086079
—And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn’t have scenes like that when	 37.42207308235041
the hearse capsized round Dunphy’s and upset the coffin on to the road.	 24.64189895581487
—That was terrible, Mr Power’s shocked face said, and the corpse fell	 106.75570261909205
about the road. Terrible!	 126.17099433511135
—First round Dunphy’s, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Gordon Bennett cup.	 102.36337143761973
—Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.	 34.817921065372786
Bom! Upset. A coffin bumped out on to the road. Burst open. Paddy	 33.91617519987134
Dignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too	 93.6140572365764
large for him. Red face: grey now. Mouth fallen open. Asking what’s up	 286.8114838060302
now. Quite right to close it. Looks horrid open. Then the insides	 89.59089421708146
decompose quickly. Much better to close up all the orifices. Yes, also.	 83.81837989231173
With wax. The sphincter loose. Seal up all.	 155.68821110928826
—Dunphy’s, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.	 86.8008743226459
Dunphy’s corner. Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief. A	 116.33164591224008
pause by the wayside. Tiptop position for a pub. Expect we’ll pull up	 52.09150502050475
here on the way back to drink his health. Pass round the consolation.	 66.12936988872025
Elixir of life.	 23.724409079747204
But suppose now it did happen. Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in	 93.67062156486979
the knocking about? He would and he wouldn’t, I suppose. Depends on	 132.3534262637892
where. The circulation stops. Still some might ooze out of an artery.	 62.91289654488453
It would be better to bury them in red: a dark red.	 118.36405245080181
In silence they drove along Phibsborough road. An empty hearse trotted	 89.06276135282654
by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.	 104.14189990360103
Crossguns bridge: the royal canal.	 40.40405163999081
Water rushed roaring through the sluices. A man stood on his dropping	 80.37483743315344
barge, between clamps of turf. On the towpath by the lock a	 49.97219984221931
slacktethered horse. Aboard of the _Bugabu._	 22.812085153018238
Their eyes watched him. On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on	 33.53086994392177
his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of	 58.587554443768276
reeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs. Athlone, Mullingar,	 114.28306986764804
Moyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal. Or	 37.65578371168829
cycle down. Hire some old crock, safety. Wren had one the other day at	 62.617473475811245
the auction but a lady’s. Developing waterways. James M’Cann’s hobby to	 52.995409221518734
row me o’er the ferry. Cheaper transit. By easy stages. Houseboats.	 32.93710155872399
Camping out. Also hearses. To heaven by water. Perhaps I will without	 87.87239982224258
writing. Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla. Dropping down lock by	 101.86155201769063
lock to Dublin. With turf from the midland bogs. Salute. He lifted his	 70.69743288516834
brown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam.	 50.912648216593645
They drove on past Brian Boroimhe house. Near it now.	 72.07892929615649
—I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.	 29.032369222805848
—Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.	 21.46488624358062
—How is that? Martin Cunningham said. Left him weeping, I suppose?	 53.45519656543702
—Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.	 124.90367149670028
The carriage steered left for Finglas road.	 92.777009883669
The stonecutter’s yard on the right. Last lap. Crowded on the spit of	 34.91432794514635
land silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands,	 146.94137326336258
knelt in grief, pointing. Fragments of shapes, hewn. In white silence:	 59.65370048175523
appealing. The best obtainable. Thos. H. Dennany, monumental builder	 20.62420104137352
and sculptor.	 15.372472535691111
Passed.	 2539.7970503388506
On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton’s, an old tramp sat,	 64.81947786038454
grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown	 21.135445913501066
yawning boot. After life’s journey.	 56.76361957055626
Gloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.	 228.97830442916154
Mr Power pointed.	 39.45696732995347
—That is where Childs was murdered, he said. The last house.	 97.44665314595834
—So it is, Mr Dedalus said. A gruesome case. Seymour Bushe got him off.	 43.88671574165012
Murdered his brother. Or so they said.	 161.08228688676198
—The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.	 54.2700765785083
—Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added. That’s the maxim of the	 22.662139377824857
law. Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent	 182.69550224787722
person to be wrongfully condemned.	 85.64733504461239
They looked. Murderer’s ground. It passed darkly. Shuttered,	 96.46837640657132
tenantless, unweeded garden. Whole place gone to hell. Wrongfully	 82.56756682677678
condemned. Murder. The murderer’s image in the eye of the murdered.	 54.10470487477377
They love reading about it. Man’s head found in a garden. Her clothing	 138.14660454402346
consisted of. How she met her death. Recent outrage. The weapon used.	 90.79489822527242
Murderer is still at large. Clues. A shoelace. The body to be exhumed.	 42.674527317971425
Murder will out.	 2201.878219899999
Cramped in this carriage. She mightn’t like me to come that way without	 82.02733441290249
letting her know. Must be careful about women. Catch them once with	 133.93446098478128
their pants down. Never forgive you after. Fifteen.	 106.19379421529472
The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze. Dark poplars,	 42.699597341847884
rare white forms. Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the	 42.98395787366053
trees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain	 50.81909818591606
gestures on the air.	 91.7547209838428
The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped. Martin Cunningham put	 29.52580292582201
out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with	 44.089110955312385
his knee. He stepped out. Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.	 60.667300948292834
Change that soap now. Mr Bloom’s hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly	 71.27928267231486
and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket.	 39.31323696994504
He stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand	 49.057640474375084
still held.	 723.9793371365595
Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages. It’s all the same.	 58.99121073830886
Pallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley. Pomp of death.	 49.850599279683195
Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and	 83.5864797089628
fruit. Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead.	 131.06474435062987
Dogbiscuits. Who ate them? Mourners coming out.	 66.52951724037348
He followed his companions. Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes	 60.89680346030537
walking after them. Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took	 78.45900356953219
out the two wreaths. He handed one to the boy.	 91.22420678217252
Where is that child’s funeral disappeared to?	 41.86472456943491
A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread,	 42.61870271052491
dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a	 47.285149500008025
granite block. The waggoner marching at their head saluted.	 118.70156240850957
Coffin now. Got here before us, dead as he is. Horse looking round at	 164.65242541021874
it with his plume skeowways. Dull eye: collar tight on his neck,	 115.09114670736678
pressing on a bloodvessel or something. Do they know what they cart out	 32.32272250467052
here every day? Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day. Then Mount	 77.49691759983551
Jerome for the protestants. Funerals all over the world everywhere	 31.621306736198022
every minute. Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick.	 56.35263057545538
Thousands every hour. Too many in the world.	 167.01785965730255
Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl. Leanjawed harpy,	 57.87612469413594
hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry. Girl’s face stained with dirt	 96.78216198365513
and tears, holding the woman’s arm, looking up at her for a sign to	 71.97227085871936
cry. Fish’s face, bloodless and livid.	 38.0453022424217
The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates. So	 52.13565308308073
much dead weight. Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath. First	 127.73347967866238
the stiff: then the friends of the stiff. Corny Kelleher and the boy	 53.03557712612563
followed with their wreaths. Who is that beside them? Ah, the	 140.1840861285708
brother-in-law.	 6060.589310016232
All walked after.	 357.61853429157634
Martin Cunningham whispered:	 24.474909475081123
—I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.	 73.41744037725202
—What? Mr Power whispered. How so?	 60.36100717572195
—His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered. Had the	 26.872486575793626
Queen’s hotel in Ennis. You heard him say he was going to Clare.	 69.22437622278598
Anniversary.	 4.608171674364364
—O God! Mr Power whispered. First I heard of it. Poisoned himself?	 50.04109572642847
He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed	 120.84305904305862
towards the cardinal’s mausoleum. Speaking.	 46.010493984214655
—Was he insured? Mr Bloom asked.	 46.02673259425287
—I believe so, Mr Kernan answered. But the policy was heavily	 98.58829641662649
mortgaged. Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.	 62.181539121538684
—How many children did he leave?	 40.30976981317856
—Five. Ned Lambert says he’ll try to get one of the girls into Todd’s.	 63.47574341320804
—A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently. Five young children.	 89.12911363715999
—A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.	 72.44977265429107
—Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.	 58.05983936138577
Has the laugh at him now.	 98.56403117884157
He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished. She had	 38.60980891795556
outlived him. Lost her husband. More dead for her than for me. One must	 114.56999896418952
outlive the other. Wise men say. There are more women than men in the	 62.9061269022041
world. Condole with her. Your terrible loss. I hope you’ll soon follow	 91.05632347784307
him. For Hindu widows only. She would marry another. Him? No. Yet who	 119.3414088623239
knows after. Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died. Drawn on	 80.67921048842499
a guncarriage. Victoria and Albert. Frogmore memorial mourning. But in	 77.00062625800204
the end she put a few violets in her bonnet. Vain in her heart of	 51.12628601508952
hearts. All for a shadow. Consort not even a king. Her son was the	 137.0571785283331
substance. Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back,	 183.95950750481558
waiting. It never comes. One must go first: alone, under the ground:	 142.96581635105866
and lie no more in her warm bed.	 97.51014980815384
—How are you, Simon? Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands. Haven’t	 38.56612479060697
seen you for a month of Sundays.	 66.27563598509914
—Never better. How are all in Cork’s own town?	 101.03306453157181
—I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert	 53.51497019464589
said. Same old six and eightpence. Stopped with Dick Tivy.	 134.23770216061973
—And how is Dick, the solid man?	 68.1197942251838
—Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.	 80.0569104353627
—By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder. Dick Tivy bald?	 106.30611858235532
—Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said,	 28.3072021805886
pointing ahead. A few bob a skull. Just to keep them going till the	 70.53471169015006
insurance is cleared up.	 288.73730413829486
—Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously. Is that the eldest boy in front?	 24.84040780114438
—Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife’s brother. John Henry Menton is	 29.409503733265183
behind. He put down his name for a quid.	 65.67029371647409
—I’ll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said. I often told poor Paddy he ought	 52.863469401509384
to mind that job. John Henry is not the worst in the world.	 110.57605907005079
—How did he lose it? Ned Lambert asked. Liquor, what?	 30.466562426715445
—Many a good man’s fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.	 44.19419294207067
They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel. Mr Bloom stood	 26.684948643714915
behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and	 61.17250947694528
at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar. Poor boy! Was	 126.06439441183844
he there when the father? Both unconscious. Lighten up at the last	 80.52621753786902
moment and recognise for the last time. All he might have done. I owe	 59.714360772647574
three shillings to O’Grady. Would he understand? The mutes bore the	 69.64335747713793
coffin into the chapel. Which end is his head?	 150.0090425784922
After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened	 52.653422398539
light. The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow	 79.23408442321893
candles at its corners. Always in front of us. Corny Kelleher, laying a	 111.73530050627504
wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel. The mourners	 105.16372337839651
knelt here and there in prayingdesks. Mr Bloom stood behind near the	 74.4409218035093
font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper	 134.84250805958683
from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it. He fitted his black	 55.93629076457249
hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.	 78.61040817467732
A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a	 75.47503361941646
door. The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with	 45.71596833537053
one hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad’s	 42.6507031878842
belly. Who’ll read the book? I, said the rook.	 160.40709599317458
They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book	 27.308447063104996
with a fluent croak.	 10.272595751323685
Father Coffey. I knew his name was like a coffin. _Dominenamine._ Bully	 48.30771745642442
about the muzzle he looks. Bosses the show. Muscular christian. Woe	 73.53485103571782
betide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest. Thou art Peter. Burst	 206.34747047933885
sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will. With a belly on	 179.83487948734216
him like a poisoned pup. Most amusing expressions that man finds. Hhhn:	 39.056634500144234
burst sideways.	 4055.5004317627972
_—Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, Domine._	 13.022572218386902
Makes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin. Requiem	 89.61583610494127
mass. Crape weepers. Blackedged notepaper. Your name on the altarlist.	 33.5525693578281
Chilly place this. Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning	 142.92506281184814
in the gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please. Eyes of a	 77.58231407408448
toad too. What swells him up that way? Molly gets swelled after	 137.53993891547117
cabbage. Air of the place maybe. Looks full up of bad gas. Must be an	 120.67895402140891
infernal lot of bad gas round the place. Butchers, for instance: they	 41.38683023844214
get like raw beefsteaks. Who was telling me? Mervyn Browne. Down in the	 59.024150933206776
vaults of saint Werburgh’s lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have	 105.52047522191855
to bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn	 52.383084308977
it. Out it rushes: blue. One whiff of that and you’re a goner.	 95.44972695029135
My kneecap is hurting me. Ow. That’s better.	 91.462682919638
The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy’s	 32.788180258722385
bucket and shook it over the coffin. Then he walked to the other end	 79.45770523686033
and shook it again. Then he came back and put it back in the bucket. As	 39.11636370590551
you were before you rested. It’s all written down: he has to do it.	 75.97457000315458
_—Et ne nos inducas in tentationem._	 27.91332723020868
The server piped the answers in the treble. I often thought it would be	 51.58442749134722
better to have boy servants. Up to fifteen or so. After that, of course	 120.68525522810728
Holy water that was, I expect. Shaking sleep out of it. He must be fed	 65.75580073762173
up with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up.	 59.49328700690192
What harm if he could see what he was shaking it over. Every mortal day	 41.39252942641709
a fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in	 115.87719292825672
childbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls	 32.53757825348031
with little sparrows’ breasts. All the year round he prayed the same	 75.9397220194809
thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep. On Dignam	 133.89601919149888
now.	 813.325939680297
_—In paradisum._	 25.877283914292452
Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise. Says that over	 82.90135531460632
everybody. Tiresome kind of a job. But he has to say something.	 83.51831730402442
The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server. Corny	 52.975449184834815
Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the	 51.24375350190626
coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart. Corny	 82.38237545181147
Kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law. All	 134.14596675483276
followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air. Mr Bloom	 49.48203221205822
came last folding his paper again into his pocket. He gazed gravely at	 79.05362730074478
the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left. The metal	 69.24935257747205
wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt	 34.2038224094044
boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.	 70.57939224254918
The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo. Lord, I mustn’t lilt here.	 81.17788405675681
—The O’Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.	 52.60364283878317
Mr Power’s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.	 18.698898663992534
—He’s at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O’. But	 75.24215949829993
his heart is buried in Rome. How many broken hearts are buried here,	 61.517371721713815
Simon!	 6665.955645642782
—Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said. I’ll soon be stretched	 60.59398043625918
beside her. Let Him take me whenever He likes.	 55.368420937663025
Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little	 83.85089018324945
in his walk. Mr Power took his arm.	 43.61779471051911
—She’s better where she is, he said kindly.	 76.30415022503578
—I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp. I suppose she is in	 27.819597616061678
heaven if there is a heaven.	 310.51481526804463
Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to	 54.745120364689484
plod by.	 22.249992977439717
—Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.	 81.25751115900385
Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.	 39.65665914174522
—The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said. I suppose we can	 63.56914684341372
do so too. We are the last. This cemetery is a treacherous place.	 120.50318095069234
They covered their heads.	 233.40948347042936
—The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don’t you think?	 92.10474587489968
Mr Kernan said with reproof.	 25.908980605855277
Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes. Secret	 55.22601554427215
eyes, secretsearching. Mason, I think: not sure. Beside him again. We	 85.94273977134996
are the last. In the same boat. Hope he’ll say something else.	 64.18951706076206
Mr Kernan added:	 38.14367927893363
—The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more	 106.04084693510534
impressive I must say.	 33.31001043575683
Mr Bloom gave prudent assent. The language of course was another thing.	 49.456563321663666
Mr Kernan said with solemnity:	 25.908980605855277
—_I am the resurrection and the life_. That touches a man’s inmost	 32.505568099133754
heart.	 1482.469507881094
—It does, Mr Bloom said.	 36.05135430822263
Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two	 122.86095035788789
with his toes to the daisies? No touching that. Seat of the affections.	 26.452624439173903
Broken heart. A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood	 89.28350013248469
every day. One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are. Lots of	 63.83567424409284
them lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers. Old rusty pumps: damn	 172.63704134396085
the thing else. The resurrection and the life. Once you are dead you	 47.995905695625886
are dead. That last day idea. Knocking them all up out of their graves.	 85.01409347203335
Come forth, Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job. Get up! Last	 79.86013921480946
day! Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and	 93.55601814698255
the rest of his traps. Find damn all of himself that morning.	 79.66711868895005
Pennyweight of powder in a skull. Twelve grammes one pennyweight. Troy	 49.23632056162623
measure.	 12565.164778433977
Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side.	 88.44958912031944
—Everything went off A1, he said. What?	 93.2011475593196
He looked on them from his drawling eye. Policeman’s shoulders. With	 57.32849934015963
your tooraloom tooraloom.	 43.101804990616834
—As it should be, Mr Kernan said.	 32.1518698077867
—What? Eh? Corny Kelleher said.	 37.318499287141684
Mr Kernan assured him.	 40.00887653027337
—Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? John Henry Menton asked. I	 43.77134249358503
know his face.	 189.98807604450974
Ned Lambert glanced back.	 47.28297665749943
—Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the	 92.10618455704574
soprano. She’s his wife.	 107.58993566861723
—O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said. I haven’t seen her for some	 41.85939170220587
time. She was a finelooking woman. I danced with her, wait, fifteen	 69.32975662615576
seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon’s in Roundtown. And a good	 44.74918888575304
armful she was.	 24.831553373374682
He looked behind through the others.	 109.77661042054207
—What is he? he asked. What does he do? Wasn’t he in the stationery	 44.94634436795596
line? I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.	 173.31190364443106
Ned Lambert smiled.	 94.80298580857468
—Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely’s. A traveller for blottingpaper.	 34.85729029854842
—In God’s name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like	 25.072238768364095
that for? She had plenty of game in her then.	 113.90734962672529
—Has still, Ned Lambert said. He does some canvassing for ads.	 51.640756622501314
John Henry Menton’s large eyes stared ahead.	 38.97335009715672
The barrow turned into a side lane. A portly man, ambushed among the	 41.99615896947865
grasses, raised his hat in homage. The gravediggers touched their caps.	 50.311969391642876
—John O’Connell, Mr Power said pleased. He never forgets a friend.	 57.52018735527173
Mr O’Connell shook all their hands in silence. Mr Dedalus said:	 60.42146410391397
—I am come to pay you another visit.	 93.61325641872922
—My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice. I don’t want	 56.04400698237415
your custom at all.	 74.56012458860818
Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin	 112.66564073309235
Cunningham’s side puzzling two long keys at his back.	 58.80785079746691
—Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?	 57.555550231044485
—I did not, Martin Cunningham said.	 17.38164957274196
They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear. The	 116.50919948463397
caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke	 45.68877636745334
in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.	 45.4002746967035
—They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy	 97.58923579131972
evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. They asked for	 79.46659540122596
Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried. After	 73.8010768569662
traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough. One of the	 82.83852463207494
drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy. The other drunk was	 37.06000508132824
blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.	 124.34111514536697
The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. He	 48.14785970933255
resumed:	 4.608171674364364
—And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, _Not a bloody bit like	 67.48245175408904
the man_, says he. _That’s not Mulcahy_, says he, _whoever done it_.	 55.595321683679344
Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher,	 48.53544297268995
accepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as	 53.64277391465721
he walked.	 40.36206349921228
—That’s all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.	 60.669468920901146
—I know, Hynes said. I know that.	 26.740847268302776
—To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said. It’s pure	 86.98354224206501
goodheartedness: damn the thing else.	 59.26925603129271
Mr Bloom admired the caretaker’s prosperous bulk. All want to be on	 21.213974864142333
good terms with him. Decent fellow, John O’Connell, real good sort.	 127.09411542160744
Keys: like Keyes’s ad: no fear of anyone getting out. No passout	 136.43648972399265
checks. _Habeas corpus_. I must see about that ad after the funeral.	 58.07809186171085
Did I write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she	 81.94395500434571
disturbed me writing to Martha? Hope it’s not chucked in the dead	 69.31350300141717
letter office. Be the better of a shave. Grey sprouting beard. That’s	 124.11866738610588
the first sign when the hairs come out grey. And temper getting cross.	 120.56191902573548
Silver threads among the grey. Fancy being his wife. Wonder he had the	 82.14425517982374
gumption to propose to any girl. Come out and live in the graveyard.	 44.09838909332509
Dangle that before her. It might thrill her first. Courting death.	 105.17924329153442
Shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about. The	 75.04506140018951
shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O’Connell must be	 67.59834523082792
a descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy	 37.200147678607394
man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark. Will o’	 64.74453012504748
the wisp. Gas of graves. Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at	 46.97628015621684
all. Women especially are so touchy. Tell her a ghost story in bed to	 75.06703158963123
make her sleep. Have you ever seen a ghost? Well, I have. It was a	 58.644221946605754
pitchdark night. The clock was on the stroke of twelve. Still they’d	 129.8261970394341
kiss all right if properly keyed up. Whores in Turkish graveyards.	 80.11841091437464
Learn anything if taken young. You might pick up a young widow here.	 143.2422057161273
Men like that. Love among the tombstones. Romeo. Spice of pleasure. In	 46.82343563183952
the midst of death we are in life. Both ends meet. Tantalising for the	 71.31162602617295
poor dead. Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving. Gnawing their	 32.40753203085038
vitals. Desire to grig people. Molly wanting to do it at the window.	 79.31642416640781
Eight children he has anyway.	 118.02365925909913
He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field	 84.88096603707771
after field. Holy fields. More room if they buried them standing.	 228.4951692887862
Sitting or kneeling you couldn’t. Standing? His head might come up some	 158.43334924955974
day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing. All honeycombed	 45.87427827467094
the ground must be: oblong cells. And very neat he keeps it too: trim	 51.64867851711974
grass and edgings. His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome. Well, so	 104.78865199800249
it is. Ought to be flowers of sleep. Chinese cemeteries with giant	 35.100871527548875
poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me. The Botanic	 57.330045800512025
Gardens are just over there. It’s the blood sinking in the earth gives	 107.30031653317027
new life. Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy.	 115.0982064949461
Every man his price. Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure,	 211.5081904359623
invaluable for fruit garden. A bargain. By carcass of William	 70.29720005156052
Wilkinson, auditor and accountant, lately deceased, three pounds	 32.741240905817214
thirteen and six. With thanks.	 241.75069214542071
I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh,	 155.0774799244589
nails. Charnelhouses. Dreadful. Turning green and pink decomposing. Rot	 125.04507563620794
quick in damp earth. The lean old ones tougher. Then a kind of a	 126.8785665300512
tallowy kind of a cheesy. Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing	 39.57679599341655
out of them. Then dried up. Deathmoths. Of course the cells or whatever	 48.33993533835754
they are go on living. Changing about. Live for ever practically.	 95.9767163664337
Nothing to feed on feed on themselves.	 196.11002866207573
But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots. Soil must be simply	 61.658409163244194
swirling with them. Your head it simply swurls. Those pretty little	 93.9775396733491
seaside gurls. He looks cheerful enough over it. Gives him a sense of	 134.37281299891455
power seeing all the others go under first. Wonder how he looks at	 115.41023828421643
life. Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart. The one	 50.26784790285733
about the bulletin. Spurgeon went to heaven 4 a.m. this morning. 11	 77.47882496768976
p.m. (closing time). Not arrived yet. Peter. The dead themselves the	 160.9460551638915
men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what’s	 98.07731860771933
in fashion. A juicy pear or ladies’ punch, hot, strong and sweet. Keep	 109.697731917644
out the damp. You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way.	 133.90857095927535
Gravediggers in _Hamlet_. Shows the profound knowledge of the human	 80.44885019915334
heart. Daren’t joke about the dead for two years at least. _De mortuis	 78.87825511404557
nil nisi prius_. Go out of mourning first. Hard to imagine his funeral.	 71.7065557611292
Seems a sort of a joke. Read your own obituary notice they say you live	 160.98817064852557
longer. Gives you second wind. New lease of life.	 307.5517213330153
—How many have you for tomorrow? the caretaker asked.	 67.14413837320217
—Two, Corny Kelleher said. Half ten and eleven.	 149.02786454590904
The caretaker put the papers in his pocket. The barrow had ceased to	 60.98462836079165
trundle. The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole,	 46.33427493318872
stepping with care round the graves. The gravediggers bore the coffin	 108.11278023749135
and set its nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.	 34.32134881839455
Burying him. We come to bury Cæsar. His ides of March or June. He	 73.96839920334321
doesn’t know who is here nor care. Now who is that lankylooking galoot	 53.20534156342334
over there in the macintosh? Now who is he I’d like to know? Now I’d	 68.45388361550899
give a trifle to know who he is. Always someone turns up you never	 85.30824146235385
dreamt of. A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life. Yes, he	 51.09527442565885
could. Still he’d have to get someone to sod him after he died though	 80.82247863164463
he could dig his own grave. We all do. Only man buries. No, ants too.	 94.43324720052838
First thing strikes anybody. Bury the dead. Say Robinson Crusoe was	 59.48783810880024
true to life. Well then Friday buried him. Every Friday buries a	 114.80451221182105
Thursday if you come to look at it.	 51.81074634050092
O, poor Robinson Crusoe!	 41.40482942092823
How could you possibly do so?	 76.75565360623784
Poor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box. When you think of	 72.81908193411222
them all it does seem a waste of wood. All gnawed through. They could	 126.98629570474368
invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that	 94.08597888969001
way. Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow’s.	 47.99856446839241
They’re so particular. Lay me in my native earth. Bit of clay from the	 118.65971436151905
holy land. Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one	 108.65388273551254
coffin. I see what it means. I see. To protect him as long as possible	 42.71340937866116
even in the earth. The Irishman’s house is his coffin. Embalming in	 61.28794336505103
catacombs, mummies the same idea.	 27.337511410458173
Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads.	 28.08692037325576
Twelve. I’m thirteen. No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen.	 143.1220419044572
Death’s number. Where the deuce did he pop out of? He wasn’t in the	 52.73735635345981
chapel, that I’ll swear. Silly superstition that about thirteen.	 251.75327644459145
Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit. Tinge of purple. I had	 80.00513389635279
one like that when we lived in Lombard street west. Dressy fellow he	 34.095988168774525
was once. Used to change three suits in the day. Must get that grey	 83.39294533081515
suit of mine turned by Mesias. Hello. It’s dyed. His wife I forgot he’s	 144.1828438687319
not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for	 65.85176152191387
him.	 330.5397417229756
The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the	 39.176587404811215
gravetrestles. They struggled up and out: and all uncovered. Twenty.	 60.569692528102195
Pause.	 4.608171674364364
If we were all suddenly somebody else.	 37.93416129152664
Far away a donkey brayed. Rain. No such ass. Never see a dead one, they	 100.37432113103456
say. Shame of death. They hide. Also poor papa went away.	 108.75725810841094
Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper. Whisper. The	 89.50385919541961
boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in	 75.15074368568392
the black open space. Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly	 89.12007492971114
caretaker. Wellcut frockcoat. Weighing them up perhaps to see which	 145.348552021297
will go next. Well, it is a long rest. Feel no more. It’s the moment	 92.51475639518604
you feel. Must be damned unpleasant. Can’t believe it at first. Mistake	 75.40204089876906
must be: someone else. Try the house opposite. Wait, I wanted to. I	 49.24594957425812
haven’t yet. Then darkened deathchamber. Light they want. Whispering	 391.7938353056059
around you. Would you like to see a priest? Then rambling and	 59.93938165048451
wandering. Delirium all you hid all your life. The death struggle. His	 131.67653400333722
sleep is not natural. Press his lower eyelid. Watching is his nose	 222.2135367836899
pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow. Pull the	 96.6166094078762
pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he’s doomed. Devil in	 126.54014134159722
that picture of sinner’s death showing him a woman. Dying to embrace	 75.32462771820475
her in his shirt. Last act of _Lucia. Shall I nevermore behold thee_?	 93.2042960354894
Bam! He expires. Gone at last. People talk about you a bit: forget you.	 50.06140665489691
Don’t forget to pray for him. Remember him in your prayers. Even	 75.16346241273824
Parnell. Ivy day dying out. Then they follow: dropping into a hole, one	 149.65189037932768
after the other.	 87.83860291976603
We are praying now for the repose of his soul. Hoping you’re well and	 43.81851281567248
not in hell. Nice change of air. Out of the fryingpan of life into the	 63.92599110269155
fire of purgatory.	 73.35524823389444
Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself? They say you do	 61.7113148845104
when you shiver in the sun. Someone walking over it. Callboy’s warning.	 69.43196103136358
Near you. Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought. Mamma,	 123.90186907720444
poor mamma, and little Rudy.	 50.21923991700224
The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in	 71.90846951141717
on the coffin. Mr Bloom turned away his face. And if he was alive all	 35.63790999191107
the time? Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of	 43.54188197517135
course. Of course he is dead. Monday he died. They ought to have some	 34.57262067341689
law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a	 86.7279367963686
telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole. Flag of	 37.20141586923677
distress. Three days. Rather long to keep them in summer. Just as well	 92.35313775227216
to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there’s no.	 38.2444887663535
The clay fell softer. Begin to be forgotten. Out of sight, out of mind.	 81.7772625374057
The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat. Had enough of	 28.739189457049314
it. The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves	 163.55311134508528
without show. Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make	 51.86849549480407
its way deftly through the maze of graves. Quietly, sure of his ground,	 61.43601919067401
he traversed the dismal fields.	 26.711547409873237
Hynes jotting down something in his notebook. Ah, the names. But he	 106.92536262196133
knows them all. No: coming to me.	 165.02588653284508
—I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath. What is your	 86.98683660458006
christian name? I’m not sure.	 104.54079931038177
—L, Mr Bloom said. Leopold. And you might put down M’Coy’s name too. He	 81.08620685955816
asked me to.	 103.67273601292324
—Charley, Hynes said writing. I know. He was on the _Freeman_ once.	 73.89910035194346
So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne. Good	 86.37889945545504
idea a postmortem for doctors. Find out what they imagine they know. He	 123.55957425090773
died of a Tuesday. Got the run. Levanted with the cash of a few ads.	 49.90262433964199
Charley, you’re my darling. That was why he asked me to. O well, does	 84.86849951680718
no harm. I saw to that, M’Coy. Thanks, old chap: much obliged. Leave	 120.90345174968587
him under an obligation: costs nothing.	 106.37518025298627
—And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was	 33.07204537103045
over there in the...	 54.07709683523123
He looked around.	 61.8399134361914
—Macintosh. Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said. Where is he now?	 48.86297322291457
—M’Intosh, Hynes said scribbling. I don’t know who he is. Is that his	 37.776819784320594
name?	 1099.0983667900869
He moved away, looking about him.	 59.954542600873125
—No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping. I say, Hynes!	 117.047248911325
Didn’t hear. What? Where has he disappeared to? Not a sign. Well of all	 105.39799955760525
the. Has anybody here seen? Kay ee double ell. Become invisible. Good	 139.27385421523667
Lord, what became of him?	 233.92914569013533
A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.	 57.19224403997277
—O, excuse me!	 42.37663702819156
He stepped aside nimbly.	 23.291459286634556
Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole. It rose. Nearly over.	 114.00962607804134
A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested	 52.56954750424679
their spades. All uncovered again for a few instants. The boy propped	 91.95894970386492
his wreath against a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump. The	 152.5032086010415
gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards	 82.88627982030347
the barrow. Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean. One	 90.13443303516367
bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass. One, leaving his	 65.10500285850172
mates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing.	 89.79731633832091
Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband. His navelcord.	 56.26664893999507
The brother-in-law, turning away, placed something in his free hand.	 69.46213301975317
Thanks in silence. Sorry, sir: trouble. Headshake. I know that. For	 74.0272926455286
yourselves just.	 101.33425343375232
The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying	 29.92098870021678
at whiles to read a name on a tomb.	 45.196447941363104
—Let us go round by the chief’s grave, Hynes said. We have time.	 33.45641596107154
—Let us, Mr Power said.	 24.469594743593074
They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts. With awe Mr	 80.35587151729776
Power’s blank voice spoke:	 184.3166545217468
—Some say he is not in that grave at all. That the coffin was filled	 85.07780991444457
with stones. That one day he will come again.	 74.06762644756527
Hynes shook his head.	 62.762501897916536
—Parnell will never come again, he said. He’s there, all that was	 56.784198297850146
mortal of him. Peace to his ashes.	 150.39266492655017
Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses,	 32.426424074818605
broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes,	 95.53104992368434
old Ireland’s hearts and hands. More sensible to spend the money on	 111.50129030447661
some charity for the living. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Does	 42.09210239240559
anybody really? Plant him and have done with him. Like down a	 84.17876163123832
coalshoot. Then lump them together to save time. All souls’ day.	 128.55833581380824
Twentyseventh I’ll be at his grave. Ten shillings for the gardener. He	 48.304939804840814
keeps it free of weeds. Old man himself. Bent down double with his	 187.7750881954238
shears clipping. Near death’s door. Who passed away. Who departed this	 210.6748186696023
life. As if they did it of their own accord. Got the shove, all of	 77.44646449813541
them. Who kicked the bucket. More interesting if they told you what	 116.96245555163695
they were. So and So, wheelwright. I travelled for cork lino. I paid	 55.12852041551255
five shillings in the pound. Or a woman’s with her saucepan. I cooked	 61.10863241170743
good Irish stew. Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that	 50.05502045855983
poem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell. Entered into rest	 118.67118707817447
the protestants put it. Old Dr Murren’s. The great physician called him	 66.30889169818457
home. Well it’s God’s acre for them. Nice country residence. Newly	 78.64696555343623
plastered and painted. Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the	 42.23466631030124
_Church Times._ Marriage ads they never try to beautify. Rusty wreaths	 178.58335496317883
hung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil. Better value that for the money.	 75.78830541240157
Still, the flowers are more poetical. The other gets rather tiresome,	 80.02460806918386
never withering. Expresses nothing. Immortelles.	 91.97602559487812
A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch. Like stuffed. Like the	 55.95893038054403
wedding present alderman Hooper gave us. Hoo! Not a budge out of him.	 78.45063445945166
Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him. Dead animal even	 93.36660168952513
sadder. Silly-Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen	 37.78093633063295
matchbox, a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.	 42.087395031695465
The Sacred Heart that is: showing it. Heart on his sleeve. Ought to be	 48.19617781845944
sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart. Ireland was	 159.68167606907554
dedicated to it or whatever that. Seems anything but pleased. Why this	 191.5020066863278
infliction? Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket	 118.45981143293817
of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the	 38.869591742318796
boy. Apollo that was.	 84.68823661616963
How many! All these here once walked round Dublin. Faithful departed.	 139.83030305417944
As you are now so once were we.	 90.82765475575688
Besides how could you remember everybody? Eyes, walk, voice. Well, the	 191.87589288919241
voice, yes: gramophone. Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in	 112.29315262830414
the house. After dinner on a Sunday. Put on poor old greatgrandfather.	 79.62592046988908
Kraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain	 3.933542382544028
hellohello amawf krpthsth. Remind you of the voice like the photograph	 34.92590058096363
reminds you of the face. Otherwise you couldn’t remember the face after	 87.20911660892293
fifteen years, say. For instance who? For instance some fellow that	 284.51642586535894
died when I was in Wisdom Hely’s.	 54.33712625242979
Rtststr! A rattle of pebbles. Wait. Stop!	 109.85691764524483
He looked down intently into a stone crypt. Some animal. Wait. There he	 67.35731836213819
goes.	 6394.461112828948
An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the	 40.34355669928146
pebbles. An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes. The grey	 87.94194170363313
alive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it.	 109.04100669230719
Good hidingplace for treasure.	 148.24709917439563
Who lives there? Are laid the remains of Robert Emery. Robert Emmet was	 65.17680797632988
buried here by torchlight, wasn’t he? Making his rounds.	 163.25568579554965
Tail gone now.	 467.868288526941
One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow. Pick the bones	 144.82002291206493
clean no matter who it was. Ordinary meat for them. A corpse is meat	 178.84826739368722
gone bad. Well and what’s cheese? Corpse of milk. I read in that	 129.78913836824267
_Voyages in China_ that the Chinese say a white man smells like a	 59.0753504187312
corpse. Cremation better. Priests dead against it. Devilling for the	 72.3996240683871
other firm. Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers. Time of the	 18.602549424179013
plague. Quicklime feverpits to eat them. Lethal chamber. Ashes to	 120.18224039447063
ashes. Or bury at sea. Where is that Parsee tower of silence? Eaten by	 157.5699733404682
birds. Earth, fire, water. Drowning they say is the pleasantest. See	 140.23825206687
your whole life in a flash. But being brought back to life no. Can’t	 105.15206532086417
bury in the air however. Out of a flying machine. Wonder does the news	 81.331000527186
go about whenever a fresh one is let down. Underground communication.	 164.4523454203335
We learned that from them. Wouldn’t be surprised. Regular square feed	 167.52829509868172
for them. Flies come before he’s well dead. Got wind of Dignam. They	 264.42861385944553
wouldn’t care about the smell of it. Saltwhite crumbling mush of	 26.661975251403895
corpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.	 249.35801869616142
The gates glimmered in front: still open. Back to the world again.	 93.29988459702462
Enough of this place. Brings you a bit nearer every time. Last time I	 75.95134705451652
was here was Mrs Sinico’s funeral. Poor papa too. The love that kills.	 126.12258894803469
And even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I	 54.28849769580974
read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running	 210.37086302321686
gravesores. Give you the creeps after a bit. I will appear to you after	 45.27081049044698
death. You will see my ghost after death. My ghost will haunt you after	 85.69724964774902
death. There is another world after death named hell. I do not like	 92.01988498290754
that other world she wrote. No more do I. Plenty to see and hear and	 74.90375637079119
feel yet. Feel live warm beings near you. Let them sleep in their	 160.20874073425085
maggoty beds. They are not going to get me this innings. Warm beds:	 69.08215409001113
warm fullblooded life.	 342.2029899073856
Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.	 66.63736279382314
Solicitor, I think. I know his face. Menton, John Henry, solicitor,	 128.6942733314638
commissioner for oaths and affidavits. Dignam used to be in his office.	 30.97911155068187
Mat Dillon’s long ago. Jolly Mat. Convivial evenings. Cold fowl,	 82.8952699889864
cigars, the Tantalus glasses. Heart of gold really. Yes, Menton. Got	 112.19622133561373
his rag out that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside	 129.98813799666536
him. Pure fluke of mine: the bias. Why he took such a rooted dislike to	 69.43520427432011
me. Hate at first sight. Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the	 118.44084564106171
lilactree, laughing. Fellow always like that, mortified if women are	 130.5398328064809
by.	 343.92614956489206
Got a dinge in the side of his hat. Carriage probably.	 36.52628680806321
—Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.	 29.527873070068793
They stopped.	 238.370955617251
—Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.	 59.88085627662612
John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.	 34.60987928819092
—There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also.	 101.93075679077427
John Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed	 18.86045799297247
the nap with care on his coatsleeve. He clapped the hat on his head	 23.725443383308715
again.	 1025.9873088345048
—It’s all right now, Martin Cunningham said.	 23.24411052098415
John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.	 17.6844517664776
—Thank you, he said shortly.	 21.367540294571597
They walked on towards the gates. Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind a	 90.99614606897958
few paces so as not to overhear. Martin laying down the law. Martin	 122.73550781819037
could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his	 88.448401747278
seeing it.	 335.8346599604637
Oyster eyes. Never mind. Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him.	 129.50977405606082
Get the pull over him that way.	 175.593121592191
Thank you. How grand we are this morning!	 34.1208664862023

Right and left parallel clanging ringing a doubledecker and a	 65.75091791376276

THE WEARER OF THE CROWN	 15.855993725549684
Under the porch of the general post office shoeblacks called and	 35.19779515421444
polished. Parked in North Prince’s street His Majesty’s vermilion	 35.813585026723125

—There it is, Red Murray said. Alexander Keyes.	 22.140495528603942
—Just cut it out, will you? Mr Bloom said, and I’ll take it round to	 42.682767837268834
the _Telegraph_ office.	 57.496583184112296
The door of Ruttledge’s office creaked again. Davy Stephens, minute in	 51.96454015541549
a large capecoat, a small felt hat crowning his ringlets, passed out	 67.94756482909206
with a roll of papers under his cape, a king’s courier.	 44.754676504218786
Red Murray’s long shears sliced out the advertisement from the	 81.81486678713462
newspaper in four clean strokes. Scissors and paste.	 61.8868940806142
—I’ll go through the printingworks, Mr Bloom said, taking the cut	 43.55876478004513
square.	 11805.861630193687
—Of course, if he wants a par, Red Murray said earnestly, a pen behind	 48.83399532474568
his ear, we can do him one.	 59.50665331531141
—Right, Mr Bloom said with a nod. I’ll rub that in.	 33.83401532459335
We.	 392.587246987247
WILLIAM BRAYDEN, ESQUIRE, OF OAKLANDS, SANDYMOUNT	 62.81480883457691
Red Murray touched Mr Bloom’s arm with the shears and whispered:	 88.15415044553477
—Brayden.	 4.608171674364364
Mr Bloom turned and saw the liveried porter raise his lettered cap as a	 32.284921647765856
stately figure entered between the newsboards of the _Weekly Freeman	 48.74197416601455
and National Press_ and the _Freeman’s Journal and National Press_.	 37.94023370108071
Dullthudding Guinness’s barrels. It passed statelily up the staircase,	 140.50600154921602
steered by an umbrella, a solemn beardframed face. The broadcloth back	 102.99875783853592
ascended each step: back. All his brains are in the nape of his neck,	 55.34802684608429
Simon Dedalus says. Welts of flesh behind on him. Fat folds of neck,	 204.12439671755482
fat, neck, fat, neck.	 157.4772050167456
—Don’t you think his face is like Our Saviour? Red Murray whispered.	 78.8162730256742
The door of Ruttledge’s office whispered: ee: cree. They always build	 50.594291127512854
one door opposite another for the wind to. Way in. Way out.	 112.07864525630211
Our Saviour: beardframed oval face: talking in the dusk. Mary, Martha.	 123.60109422577861
Steered by an umbrella sword to the footlights: Mario the tenor.	 44.52522965983915
—Or like Mario, Mr Bloom said.	 59.8939323925837
—Yes, Red Murray agreed. But Mario was said to be the picture of Our	 41.144423481161624
Saviour.	 27411.14912145641

They watched the knees, legs, boots vanish. Neck.	 242.76653421442214
A telegram boy stepped in nimbly, threw an envelope on the counter and	 146.77226058335123
stepped off posthaste with a word:	 80.59025322535575
_—Freeman!_	 7790.460052842213
Mr Bloom said slowly:	 34.425586212359896
—Well, he is one of our saviours also.	 88.57331538066423
A meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as he passed	 30.81875960709346
in through a sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage, along	 88.79095831731934
the now reverberating boards. But will he save the circulation?	 75.19477998952944
Thumping. Thumping.	 1011.3894538981172
He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn	 45.05986653504853
packing paper. Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towards	 64.31936746494688

machineries are pegging away too. Like these, got out of hand:	 151.86187316076405
fermenting. Working away, tearing away. And that old grey rat tearing	 94.717199782794
to get in.	 75.6869888185023
HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT	 211.62204294603933
Mr Bloom halted behind the foreman’s spare body, admiring a glossy	 18.358560244601623
crown.	 3877.219656660332
Strange he never saw his real country. Ireland my country. Member for	 98.49256828362391
College green. He boomed that workaday worker tack for all it was	 32.195285611477146
worth. It’s the ads and side features sell a weekly, not the stale news	 236.52115830412097
in the official gazette. Queen Anne is dead. Published by authority in	 48.07534708475698
the year one thousand and. Demesne situate in the townland of	 26.011093430216164
Rosenallis, barony of Tinnahinch. To all whom it may concern schedule	 30.938692490269926
pursuant to statute showing return of number of mules and jennets	 36.19351907637374
exported from Ballina. Nature notes. Cartoons. Phil Blake’s weekly Pat	 45.07450352482986
and Bull story. Uncle Toby’s page for tiny tots. Country bumpkin’s	 142.36585424003542
queries. Dear Mr Editor, what is a good cure for flatulence? I’d like	 76.54976187901276
that part. Learn a lot teaching others. The personal note. M. A. P.	 263.6768922826927
Mainly all pictures. Shapely bathers on golden strand. World’s biggest	 73.23558504944141

laughing heartily at each other. Cuprani too, printer. More Irish than	 99.58519007729438
the Irish.	 68.37682921406459
The machines clanked in threefour time. Thump, thump, thump. Now if he	 33.858243702323676
got paralysed there and no-one knew how to stop them they’d clank on	 97.53958009481332
and on the same, print it over and over and up and back. Monkeydoodle	 65.03965413354693
the whole thing. Want a cool head.	 112.70198104537526
—Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor, Hynes said.	 98.8113294590709
Soon be calling him my lord mayor. Long John is backing him, they say.	 88.69457266330171
The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the	 49.592905427304885
sheet and made a sign to a typesetter. He handed the sheet silently	 113.91138026457165
over the dirty glass screen.	 232.78041140031678
—Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.	 90.10464694224373
Mr Bloom stood in his way.	 27.519578813661266
—If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said,	 32.86770954408252
pointing backward with his thumb.	 189.16313543373624
—Did you? Hynes asked.	 93.87090685561516
—Mm, Mr Bloom said. Look sharp and you’ll catch him.	 33.52012994623129
—Thanks, old man, Hynes said. I’ll tap him too.	 63.83631650665052
He hurried on eagerly towards the _Freeman’s Journal_.	 47.57030296914779
Three bob I lent him in Meagher’s. Three weeks. Third hint.	 44.81135930074594
WE SEE THE CANVASSER AT WORK	 104.83847280305442
Mr Bloom laid his cutting on Mr Nannetti’s desk.	 53.56285537136903
—Excuse me, councillor, he said. This ad, you see. Keyes, you remember?	 52.72348388004838
Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded.	 87.52356122894841
—He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said.	 33.58642124728258
The foreman moved his pencil towards it.	 28.90678784832505
—But wait, Mr Bloom said. He wants it changed. Keyes, you see. He wants	 32.35433341337993
two keys at the top.	 61.11184264073828
Hell of a racket they make. He doesn’t hear it. Nannan. Iron nerves.	 116.00093423712887
Maybe he understands what I.	 119.82118869593869
The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began	 67.9851566045341
to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.	 67.75077603241728
—Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.	 26.619652642936174
Let him take that in first.	 130.59272212839636
Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the	 52.056642246325
foreman’s sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the	 41.41056741013353
obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper. Clank it. Clank it. Miles	 67.17750807462195
of it unreeled. What becomes of it after? O, wrap up meat, parcels:	 142.04528531839838
various uses, thousand and one things.	 241.48282221605368
Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew	 15.666200235612566
swiftly on the scarred woodwork.	 18.979934695910355
HOUSE OF KEY(E)S	 165.85551427458668
—Like that, see. Two crossed keys here. A circle. Then here the name.	 128.83486707897606
Alexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant. So on.	 147.48836569066523
Better not teach him his own business.	 53.35837915770602
—You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants. Then round the top	 91.31871188539513
in leaded: the house of keys. You see? Do you think that’s a good idea?	 40.00846945756135
The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched	 24.709477239002876
there quietly.	 355.898061358419
—The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys. You know, councillor,	 36.66533552718647
the Manx parliament. Innuendo of home rule. Tourists, you know, from	 48.20925655819793
the isle of Man. Catches the eye, you see. Can you do that?	 51.51385641944377
I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that _voglio._ But then	 73.98032909842277
if he didn’t know only make it awkward for him. Better not.	 54.40363954080121
—We can do that, the foreman said. Have you the design?	 65.51176340395219
—I can get it, Mr Bloom said. It was in a Kilkenny paper. He has a	 26.782461290988547
house there too. I’ll just run out and ask him. Well, you can do that	 94.37211534804163
and just a little par calling attention. You know the usual. Highclass	 51.13837649672364
licensed premises. Longfelt want. So on.	 231.08382221430273
The foreman thought for an instant.	 72.18544977692939
—We can do that, he said. Let him give us a three months’ renewal.	 25.55838206653077
A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage. He began to check it	 34.743634367847605
silently. Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks,	 43.43416115282679
watching the silent typesetters at their cases.	 123.58420916150698
ORTHOGRAPHICAL	 4.608171674364364
Want to be sure of his spelling. Proof fever. Martin Cunningham forgot	 42.79397556709656
to give us his spellingbee conundrum this morning. It is amusing to	 29.839296475681923
view the unpar one ar alleled embarra two ars is it? double ess ment of	 35.757755771505096
a harassed pedlar while gauging au the symmetry with a y of a peeled	 19.165178658815815
pear under a cemetery wall. Silly, isn’t it? Cemetery put in of course	 76.90183473631691
on account of the symmetry.	 11.274426658142515
I should have said when he clapped on his topper. Thank you. I ought to	 35.07429108204485
have said something about an old hat or something. No. I could have	 96.94672782914783
said. Looks as good as new now. See his phiz then.	 109.78185964479017
Sllt. The nethermost deck of the first machine jogged forward its	 52.213821425676656
flyboard with sllt the first batch of quirefolded papers. Sllt. Almost	 56.76375301399692
human the way it sllt to call attention. Doing its level best to speak.	 107.22210489501462
That door too sllt creaking, asking to be shut. Everything speaks in	 105.69775741865008
its own way. Sllt.	 125.09634989464844
NOTED CHURCHMAN AN OCCASIONAL CONTRIBUTOR	 9.394083302361718
The foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying:	 81.00201062373911
—Wait. Where’s the archbishop’s letter? It’s to be repeated in the	 71.71284511046034
_Telegraph._ Where’s what’s his name?	 140.96444879819
He looked about him round his loud unanswering machines.	 91.53171750253625
—Monks, sir? a voice asked from the castingbox.	 74.85687378221328
—Ay. Where’s Monks?	 173.5754040527369
—Monks!	 6468.361989311308
Mr Bloom took up his cutting. Time to get out.	 29.15066182751711
—Then I’ll get the design, Mr Nannetti, he said, and you’ll give it a	 58.17621627255215
good place I know.	 90.24183467434248
—Monks!	 6468.361989311308
—Yes, sir.	 32.67659391838357
Three months’ renewal. Want to get some wind off my chest first. Try it	 115.50417989580079
anyhow. Rub in August: good idea: horseshow month. Ballsbridge.	 84.80076474736065
Tourists over for the show.	 85.50698959938066
A DAYFATHER	 13.400948507362273
He walked on through the caseroom passing an old man, bowed,	 41.70414878803475
spectacled, aproned. Old Monks, the dayfather. Queer lot of stuff he	 51.36074619657277
must have put through his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs’	 41.78577671182045
ads, speeches, divorce suits, found drowned. Nearing the end of his	 44.87092087708837
tether now. Sober serious man with a bit in the savingsbank I’d say.	 59.65551807556752
Wife a good cook and washer. Daughter working the machine in the	 91.82340734168363
parlour. Plain Jane, no damn nonsense.	 232.42722110395738
AND IT WAS THE FEAST OF THE PASSOVER	 17.227649665062824
He stayed in his walk to watch a typesetter neatly distributing type.	 44.92489504024755
Reads it backwards first. Quickly he does it. Must require some	 133.70359512972158
practice that. mangiD kcirtaP. Poor papa with his hagadah book, reading	 56.51023569627151
backwards with his finger to me. Pessach. Next year in Jerusalem. Dear,	 80.72014006985424
O dear! All that long business about that brought us out of the land of	 51.24597396206434
Egypt and into the house of bondage _alleluia. Shema Israel Adonai	 50.90687780034116
Elohenu_. No, that’s the other. Then the twelve brothers, Jacob’s sons.	 106.76164427715418
And then the lamb and the cat and the dog and the stick and the water	 63.08765232639381
and the butcher. And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he	 39.08559234325131
kills the ox and the dog kills the cat. Sounds a bit silly till you	 59.36674708777498
come to look into it well. Justice it means but it’s everybody eating	 101.27758537514535
everyone else. That’s what life is after all. How quickly he does that	 150.0689129705399
job. Practice makes perfect. Seems to see with his fingers.	 79.37063061796145
Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to	 33.27840945130027
the landing. Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch	 62.410751949874005
him out perhaps. Better phone him up first. Number? Yes. Same as	 290.5119399066324
Citron’s house. Twentyeight. Twentyeight double four.	 119.39791277729462
ONLY ONCE MORE THAT SOAP	 181.72861777156555
He went down the house staircase. Who the deuce scrawled all over those	 39.06436394111918
walls with matches? Looks as if they did it for a bet. Heavy greasy	 107.06086275860662
smell there always is in those works. Lukewarm glue in Thom’s next door	 161.74691400240562
when I was there.	 49.847454928047384
He took out his handkerchief to dab his nose. Citronlemon? Ah, the soap	 36.76720314075476
I put there. Lose it out of that pocket. Putting back his handkerchief	 83.10739030737467
he took out the soap and stowed it away, buttoned, into the hip pocket	 35.16264934131496
of his trousers.	 60.33700833491023
What perfume does your wife use? I could go home still: tram: something	 17.373599154588174
I forgot. Just to see: before: dressing. No. Here. No.	 144.62295319463198
A sudden screech of laughter came from the _Evening Telegraph_ office.	 32.65673939613616
Know who that is. What’s up? Pop in a minute to phone. Ned Lambert it	 93.78943308014686
is.	 333.00275452361905
He entered softly.	 95.66275139449014
ERIN, GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA	 84.29037919311703
—The ghost walks, professor MacHugh murmured softly, biscuitfully to	 32.91692667621263
the dusty windowpane.	 78.32118522670552
Mr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert’s quizzing	 48.19376416444278
face, asked of it sourly:	 90.8069181520248
—Agonising Christ, wouldn’t it give you a heartburn on your arse?	 72.94715063728144
Ned Lambert, seated on the table, read on:	 31.777098338307763
—_Or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on	 42.44415948439315
its way, tho’ quarrelling with the stony obstacles, to the tumbling	 31.205242433990783
waters of Neptune’s blue domain, ’mid mossy banks, fanned by gentlest	 19.659352532210654
zephyrs, played on by the glorious sunlight or ’neath the shadows cast	 119.67306871584051
o’er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the	 13.001974813720803
forest_. What about that, Simon? he asked over the fringe of his	 49.24371209419723
newspaper. How’s that for high?	 197.29427995007893
—Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said.	 89.28969259880984
Ned Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating:	 43.54137394309497
—_The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage_. O boys! O boys!	 25.967036771947846
—And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said, looking again on	 45.04293367025739
the fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea.	 28.71764087747921
—That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window. I don’t want to	 33.63700166121269
hear any more of the stuff.	 110.49010782673426
He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and,	 19.547380229724883
hungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.	 38.51579673213764
High falutin stuff. Bladderbags. Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see.	 102.5567374669665
Rather upsets a man’s day, a funeral does. He has influence they say.	 73.57072848488454
Old Chatterton, the vicechancellor, is his granduncle or his	 32.08087256898922
greatgranduncle. Close on ninety they say. Subleader for his death	 63.46754805662534
written this long time perhaps. Living to spite them. Might go first	 138.13422802457833
himself. Johnny, make room for your uncle. The right honourable Hedges	 60.5627039499914
Eyre Chatterton. Daresay he writes him an odd shaky cheque or two on	 39.6065731268588
gale days. Windfall when he kicks out. Alleluia.	 48.25775005274391
—Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said.	 51.77863820328177
—What is it? Mr Bloom asked.	 13.038783852350901
—A recently discovered fragment of Cicero, professor MacHugh answered	 33.250162029942985
with pomp of tone. _Our lovely land_.	 130.89815304554165
SHORT BUT TO THE POINT	 259.9589166183953
—Whose land? Mr Bloom said simply.	 112.2160102757031
—Most pertinent question, the professor said between his chews. With an	 61.0637320170313
accent on the whose.	 629.2131084368121
—Dan Dawson’s land Mr Dedalus said.	 85.29567849716054
—Is it his speech last night? Mr Bloom asked.	 41.65767147358522
Ned Lambert nodded.	 41.95370197184882
—But listen to this, he said.	 47.00796163720201
The doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door was	 78.87658737586305
pushed in.	 311.1927494651473
—Excuse me, J. J. O’Molloy said, entering.	 15.46344121065643
Mr Bloom moved nimbly aside.	 21.777687955612258
—I beg yours, he said.	 25.690389760539865
—Good day, Jack.	 73.96404512898597
—Come in. Come in.	 102.06049917270128
—Good day.	 68.72903901933876
—How are you, Dedalus?	 127.48392029755125
—Well. And yourself?	 314.2580312417817
J. J. O’Molloy shook his head.	 10.257751949173512
SAD	 2744.065423617926
Cleverest fellow at the junior bar he used to be. Decline, poor chap.	 57.036828529449984
That hectic flush spells finis for a man. Touch and go with him. What’s	 82.71731222604055
in the wind, I wonder. Money worry.	 67.1809872170277
—_Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks._	 65.3293689719394
—You’re looking extra.	 84.67272163691219
—Is the editor to be seen? J. J. O’Molloy asked, looking towards the	 31.82627861668501
inner door.	 299.24756965829323
—Very much so, professor MacHugh said. To be seen and heard. He’s in	 38.48465861658454
his sanctum with Lenehan.	 80.02513867936132
J. J. O’Molloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the	 32.94045978763492
pink pages of the file.	 107.38082864165624
Practice dwindling. A mighthavebeen. Losing heart. Gambling. Debts of	 28.72174270655334
honour. Reaping the whirlwind. Used to get good retainers from D. and	 90.88210938205677
T. Fitzgerald. Their wigs to show the grey matter. Brains on their	 86.26812430454696
sleeve like the statue in Glasnevin. Believe he does some literary work	 186.08467657754946
for the _Express_ with Gabriel Conroy. Wellread fellow. Myles Crawford	 100.61575554282501
began on the _Independent._ Funny the way those newspaper men veer	 107.35799270549734
about when they get wind of a new opening. Weathercocks. Hot and cold	 116.40591632756541
in the same breath. Wouldn’t know which to believe. One story good till	 109.22540404957878
you hear the next. Go for one another baldheaded in the papers and then	 59.2362393110401
all blows over. Hail fellow well met the next moment.	 83.79670619928858
—Ah, listen to this for God’ sake, Ned Lambert pleaded. _Or again if we	 54.02389696464985
but climb the serried mountain peaks..._	 22.577181918755553
—Bombast! the professor broke in testily. Enough of the inflated	 32.805713605613015
windbag!	 4.608171674364364
—_Peaks_, Ned Lambert went on, _towering high on high, to bathe our	 116.20363766746624
souls, as it were..._	 223.49993682170663
—Bathe his lips, Mr Dedalus said. Blessed and eternal God! Yes? Is he	 71.98395972972764
taking anything for it?	 168.89859869725913
_—As ’twere, in the peerless panorama of Ireland’s portfolio,	 40.646389486605216
unmatched, despite their wellpraised prototypes in other vaunted prize	 40.7803563258077
regions, for very beauty, of bosky grove and undulating plain and	 29.487207513041856
luscious pastureland of vernal green, steeped in the transcendent	 10.977993768887746
translucent glow of our mild mysterious Irish twilight..._	 80.9505807851465
HIS NATIVE DORIC	 52.131332050377615
—The moon, professor MacHugh said. He forgot Hamlet.	 48.426040110833235
_—That mantles the vista far and wide and wait till the glowing orb of	 29.367308619369645
the moon shine forth to irradiate her silver effulgence..._	 55.208400699252174
—O! Mr Dedalus cried, giving vent to a hopeless groan. Shite and	 17.68004472162189
onions! That’ll do, Ned. Life is too short.	 386.72262796008283
He took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy	 22.799705130839797
moustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.	 123.62077067093875
Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight. An	 69.84257179551729
instant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh’s	 98.8774654901751
unshaven blackspectacled face.	 21.12989585025802
—Doughy Daw! he cried.	 18.930659183774832
WHAT WETHERUP SAID	 120.53230372466058
All very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot	 120.34999940409517
cake that stuff. He was in the bakery line too, wasn’t he? Why they	 88.35107856109185
call him Doughy Daw. Feathered his nest well anyhow. Daughter engaged	 84.69610411889697
to that chap in the inland revenue office with the motor. Hooked that	 20.7286767307472
nicely. Entertainments. Open house. Big blowout. Wetherup always said	 264.002934500405
that. Get a grip of them by the stomach.	 56.252644122996486
The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested	 47.09280597503448
by a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in. The bold blue eyes stared	 35.81621047502583
about them and the harsh voice asked:	 59.248605133677366
—What is it?	 17.251153159601138
—And here comes the sham squire himself! professor MacHugh said	 38.390040953300506
grandly.	 4.608171674364364
—Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition.	 29.788031258471726
—Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat. I must get a drink	 34.54931670400554
after that.	 111.173921526146
—Drink! the editor cried. No drinks served before mass.	 172.05284871731902
—Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out. Come on, Ned.	 85.73447315907391
Ned Lambert sidled down from the table. The editor’s blue eyes roved	 52.97594227911953
towards Mr Bloom’s face, shadowed by a smile.	 77.39880599869693
—Will you join us, Myles? Ned Lambert asked.	 47.46864728287749
MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED	 80.25558919247433
—North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece. We	 46.53472393156464
won every time! North Cork and Spanish officers!	 175.3035330741005
—Where was that, Myles? Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at	 34.91753066886328
his toecaps.	 21.605641423575047
—In Ohio! the editor shouted.	 49.7500670637385
—So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.	 30.49362571902215
Passing out he whispered to J. J. O’Molloy:	 44.11527860618046
—Incipient jigs. Sad case.	 43.31792398425719
—Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face.	 46.15654798428078
My Ohio!	 47.91192705795907
—A perfect cretic! the professor said. Long, short and long.	 96.73735418392317
O, HARP EOLIAN!	 63.93748212497443
He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking	 16.668281221033663
off a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant	 77.63435746423944
unwashed teeth.	 138.09249697909434
—Bingbang, bangbang.	 4.411654744205047
Mr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.	 48.92247218560759
—Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said. I just want to phone about an ad.	 61.32743684701779
He went in.	 34.61507506064948
—What about that leader this evening? professor MacHugh asked, coming	 38.49508425704035
to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.	 37.051441408087236
—That’ll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly. Never you fret.	 31.775154380360128
Hello, Jack. That’s all right.	 32.33052632042253
—Good day, Myles, J. J. O’Molloy said, letting the pages he held slip	 43.484697060924056
limply back on the file. Is that Canada swindle case on today?	 62.87724929338678
The telephone whirred inside.	 107.5033289637549
—Twentyeight... No, twenty... Double four... Yes.	 1004.3562558798445
SPOT THE WINNER	 81.32390388275859
Lenehan came out of the inner office with _Sport_’s tissues.	 46.111732381476756
—Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup? he asked. Sceptre with O.	 51.29882711251971
Madden up.	 282.65714606956766
He tossed the tissues on to the table.	 44.3899602090473
Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was	 63.76754565220292
flung open.	 606.3719796394671
—Hush, Lenehan said. I hear feetstoops.	 133.57349984841514
Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin	 13.560072267728245
by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the	 61.606376437169715
steps. The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air	 94.39021625434002
blue scrawls and under the table came to earth.	 73.19465668826565
—It wasn’t me, sir. It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.	 44.624065680730816
—Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said. There’s a hurricane	 56.949814183060106
blowing.	 9669.252855420213
Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he	 39.77917019546325
stooped twice.	 2264.622850874194
—Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said. It was Pat	 56.58745154696815
Farrell shoved me, sir.	 57.02735391801143
He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.	 99.11317657345644
—Him, sir.	 398.86417828437226
—Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.	 38.36349423895547
He hustled the boy out and banged the door to.	 48.29591272855766
J. J. O’Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking:	 32.38657937740474
—Continued on page six, column four.	 179.24669757633615
—Yes, _Evening Telegraph_ here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office.	 29.30578864681919
Is the boss...? Yes, _Telegraph_... To where? Aha! Which auction	 110.50921087415905
rooms?... Aha! I see... Right. I’ll catch him.	 77.71966501013723
A COLLISION ENSUES	 9.296616798493048
The bell whirred again as he rang off. He came in quickly and bumped	 111.49304489031351
against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.	 68.53139993383904
—_Pardon, monsieur_, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and	 57.86903204935136
making a grimace.	 78.87395162173632
—My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip. Are you hurt? I’m in a	 32.65021977375473
hurry.	 3129.8651959710423
—Knee, Lenehan said.	 332.78401358157373
He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee:	 61.053910729107386
—The accumulation of the _anno Domini_.	 14.624969167297438
—Sorry, Mr Bloom said.	 29.097866204645765
He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused. J. J. O’Molloy	 24.344423211410675
slapped the heavy pages over. The noise of two shrill voices, a	 89.96989326366116
mouthorgan, echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on	 28.503374417876888
the doorsteps:	 7.77559996992721
We are the boys of Wexford	 33.813582860380706
Who fought with heart and hand.	 202.14834233689174
EXIT BLOOM	 53.027287990421996
—I’m just running round to Bachelor’s walk, Mr Bloom said, about this	 49.283799907434855
ad of Keyes’s. Want to fix it up. They tell me he’s round there in	 65.282929203891
Dillon’s.	 4460.576224636122
He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces. The editor who,	 62.13043285105154
leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand,	 45.22340908583367
suddenly stretched forth an arm amply.	 114.53953017029156
—Begone! he said. The world is before you.	 39.70780412159711
—Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.	 53.83614592655323
J. J. O’Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan’s hand and read them,	 52.644257680798695
blowing them apart gently, without comment.	 228.98166049499696
—He’ll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his	 59.0676523486279
blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind. Look at the young scamps	 53.09803954331916
after him.	 79.54198184397185
—Show. Where? Lenehan cried, running to the window.	 119.25334031407134
A STREET CORTÈGE	 127.43428374968818
Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr	 121.02408699223909
Bloom’s wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a	 69.20262674813712
tail of white bowknots.	 88.31892516143512
—Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said,	 52.35202698679368
and you’ll kick. O, my rib risible! Taking off his flat spaugs and the	 55.66697503314503
walk. Small nines. Steal upon larks.	 133.31410446378476
He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding	 47.21704838309697
feet past the fireplace to J. J. O’Molloy who placed the tissues in his	 42.49694784774114
receiving hands.	 76.93745420356048
—What’s that? Myles Crawford said with a start. Where are the other two	 32.81653437418378
gone?	 3074.575063198837
—Who? the professor said, turning. They’re gone round to the Oval for a	 60.7918136727871
drink. Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall. Came over last night.	 161.9657613594733
—Come on then, Myles Crawford said. Where’s my hat?	 55.40359815566204
He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his	 54.02465735578115
jacket, jingling his keys in his back pocket. They jingled then in the	 50.81066629935419
air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer.	 81.62222409685435
—He’s pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice.	 66.30206301061881
—Seems to be, J. J. O’Molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase in	 17.65632724735091
murmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems. Who has the	 74.15858966112935
most matches?	 68.03273638356943
THE CALUMET OF PEACE	 27.699066306169705
He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself. Lenehan	 130.1686557355184
promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn. J.	 129.58497246277125
J. O’Molloy opened his case again and offered it.	 88.61892694324928
—_Thanky vous_, Lenehan said, helping himself.	 59.854569192804796
The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow. He	 30.266781876867118
declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh:	 67.74778379699246
’Twas rank and fame that tempted thee,	 78.71252418132089
’Twas empire charmed thy heart.	 102.98160814305082
The professor grinned, locking his long lips.	 39.71896085297467
—Eh? You bloody old Roman empire? Myles Crawford said.	 36.82438771793109
He took a cigarette from the open case. Lenehan, lighting it for him	 54.473018222207244
with quick grace, said:	 512.6734969593265
—Silence for my brandnew riddle!	 257.0500037021289
—_Imperium romanum_, J. J. O’Molloy said gently. It sounds nobler than	 31.797183713807023
British or Brixton. The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.	 112.75874431159129
Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.	 27.312227849414793
—That’s it, he said. We are the fat. You and I are the fat in the fire.	 77.6113013697786
We haven’t got the chance of a snowball in hell.	 64.41797515169344
THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME	 35.33832741534625
—Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws. We	 45.83656155270023
mustn’t be led away by words, by sounds of words. We think of Rome,	 92.44737512238753
imperial, imperious, imperative.	 4.206040932916629
He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing:	 50.7027901151955
—What was their civilisation? Vast, I allow: but vile. Cloacae: sewers.	 106.12794481898983
The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: _It is meet to	 26.801109215430227
be here. Let us build an altar to Jehovah_. The Roman, like the	 85.32828604598097
Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on	 170.4703449830524
which he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal	 53.538453118993814
obsession. He gazed about him in his toga and he said: _It is meet to	 29.481995078086737
be here. Let us construct a watercloset._	 67.89534159210002
—Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said. Our old ancient	 111.23803247569774
ancestors, as we read in the first chapter of Guinness’s, were partial	 38.728029381580434
to the running stream.	 186.1754958468689
—They were nature’s gentlemen, J. J. O’Molloy murmured. But we have	 47.16552988411836
also Roman law.	 278.7713574522253
—And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded.	 34.913618494794385
—Do you know that story about chief baron Palles? J. J. O’Molloy asked.	 20.015036593405746
It was at the royal university dinner. Everything was going swimmingly	 54.19057850198646
—First my riddle, Lenehan said. Are you ready?	 75.01850919421366
Mr O’Madden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came in from	 68.01076653374206
the hallway. Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.	 60.42664715077327
—_Entrez, mes enfants!_ Lenehan cried.	 21.05253294546548
—I escort a suppliant, Mr O’Madden Burke said melodiously. Youth led by	 23.599281348285228
Experience visits Notoriety.	 105.43974923585365
—How do you do? the editor said, holding out a hand. Come in. Your	 33.79886882105611
governor is just gone.	 68.89753539993973
Lenehan said to all:	 75.89820808166095
—Silence! What opera resembles a railwayline? Reflect, ponder,	 45.07772181298828
excogitate, reply.	 188.13956674690778
Stephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and	 34.71666538864357
signature.	 4.608171674364364
—Who? the editor asked.	 164.26446804584987
Bit torn off.	 283.019810066443
—Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said.	 120.88863560428476
—That old pelters, the editor said. Who tore it? Was he short taken?	 53.54885988494251
On swift sail flaming	 403.97695690565774
From storm and south	 242.986377411423
He comes, pale vampire,	 25.79297222013079
Mouth to my mouth.	 288.4860847167679
—Good day, Stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over their	 56.97689090075731
shoulders. Foot and mouth? Are you turned...?	 382.96023522209435
Bullockbefriending bard.	 246.9891972786973
SHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT	 22.389659622053056
—Good day, sir, Stephen answered blushing. The letter is not mine. Mr	 78.36996127649707
Garrett Deasy asked me to...	 59.48073131833306
—O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and I knew his wife too. The	 45.01195268930214
bloodiest old tartar God ever made. By Jesus, she had the foot and	 51.42632415521028
mouth disease and no mistake! The night she threw the soup in the	 52.96947229063931
waiter’s face in the Star and Garter. Oho!	 62.186916384376744
A woman brought sin into the world. For Helen, the runaway wife of	 26.663631097272518
Menelaus, ten years the Greeks. O’Rourke, prince of Breffni.	 31.84627069518342
—Is he a widower? Stephen asked.	 106.42780756703925
—Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down the	 65.49583298151877
typescript. Emperor’s horses. Habsburg. An Irishman saved his life on	 67.46648578969
the ramparts of Vienna. Don’t you forget! Maximilian Karl O’Donnell,	 28.064971551142676
graf von Tirconnell in Ireland. Sent his heir over to make the king an	 58.68640188297257
Austrian fieldmarshal now. Going to be trouble there one day. Wild	 60.51896811962091
geese. O yes, every time. Don’t you forget that!	 70.12752375933275
—The moot point is did he forget it, J. J. O’Molloy said quietly,	 36.5679927199451
turning a horseshoe paperweight. Saving princes is a thank you job.	 70.90315429121095
Professor MacHugh turned on him.	 42.03338638836513
—And if not? he said.	 48.13200944471796
—I’ll tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began. A Hungarian it was one	 63.059050073558616
day...	 1054.805882865432
LOST CAUSES NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED	 215.80567601498277
—We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said. Success for	 40.10638119720301
us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination. We were never	 72.25744645716328
loyal to the successful. We serve them. I teach the blatant Latin	 76.10708780388693
language. I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is	 60.73446391695537
the maxim: time is money. Material domination. _Dominus!_ Lord! Where	 58.55615466910541
is the spirituality? Lord Jesus? Lord Salisbury? A sofa in a westend	 26.571170662589722
club. But the Greek!	 428.98807730991496
KYRIE ELEISON!	 4.411654744205047
A smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his long	 44.01254399552614
lips.	 3162.54872884086
—The Greek! he said again. _Kyrios!_ Shining word! The vowels the	 75.61289991441922
Semite and the Saxon know not. _Kyrie!_ The radiance of the intellect.	 35.18135930867576
I ought to profess Greek, the language of the mind. _Kyrie eleison!_	 47.71027804684155
The closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit.	 26.81132386250744
We are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered	 32.04217662161095
at Trafalgar and of the empire of the spirit, not an _imperium,_ that	 80.06739029735935
went under with the Athenian fleets at Aegospotami. Yes, yes. They went	 71.02450473517396
under. Pyrrhus, misled by an oracle, made a last attempt to retrieve	 58.36635166256619
the fortunes of Greece. Loyal to a lost cause.	 50.767475911238584
He strode away from them towards the window.	 41.32875580034726
—They went forth to battle, Mr O’Madden Burke said greyly, but they	 20.120791841294913
always fell.	 593.6049483212564
—Boohoo! Lenehan wept with a little noise. Owing to a brick received in	 46.060274883068125
the latter half of the _matinée_. Poor, poor, poor Pyrrhus!	 73.16452467108911
He whispered then near Stephen’s ear:	 79.66170475546915
LENEHAN’S LIMERICK	 310.5050764364851
—_There’s a ponderous pundit MacHugh	 64.82996672511861
Who wears goggles of ebony hue.	 70.1060814040881
As he mostly sees double	 201.80222997121925
To wear them why trouble?	 149.98374632660105
I can’t see the Joe Miller. Can you?_	 62.161764845659086
In mourning for Sallust, Mulligan says. Whose mother is beastly dead.	 154.39702756237148
Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket.	 57.68795610870897
—That’ll be all right, he said. I’ll read the rest after. That’ll be	 59.76570630717855
all right.	 94.4103148698418
Lenehan extended his hands in protest.	 39.63489268055972
—But my riddle! he said. What opera is like a railwayline?	 27.562074112220348
—Opera? Mr O’Madden Burke’s sphinx face reriddled.	 76.94244018054192
Lenehan announced gladly:	 44.47919433595008
—_The Rose of Castile_. See the wheeze? Rows of cast steel. Gee!	 75.90252939930252
He poked Mr O’Madden Burke mildly in the spleen. Mr O’Madden Burke fell	 15.744478629646876
back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.	 72.1440803131289
—Help! he sighed. I feel a strong weakness.	 203.99913934040296
Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling	 64.10611937231144
tissues.	 16823.510431629027
The professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across	 73.50225869152861
Stephen’s and Mr O’Madden Burke’s loose ties.	 82.67787261564085
—Paris, past and present, he said. You look like communards.	 129.49551594521546
—Like fellows who had blown up the Bastile, J. J. O’Molloy said in	 24.93901329290589
quiet mockery. Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland	 89.05016953294992
between you? You look as though you had done the deed. General	 260.59860440090813
Bobrikoff.	 4.608171674364364
OMNIUM GATHERUM	 4.411654744205047
—We were only thinking about it, Stephen said.	 42.31693826843339
—All the talents, Myles Crawford said. Law, the classics...	 26.0708995443858
—The turf, Lenehan put in.	 147.97703099600372
—Literature, the press.	 729.8358699652468
—If Bloom were here, the professor said. The gentle art of	 138.466649697489
advertisement.	 17027.633625570586
—And Madam Bloom, Mr O’Madden Burke added. The vocal muse. Dublin’s	 31.830943986227197
prime favourite.	 760.9201121490981
Lenehan gave a loud cough.	 159.1235117401198
—Ahem! he said very softly. O, for a fresh of breath air! I caught a	 88.0265140574183
cold in the park. The gate was open.	 206.53033026604544
“YOU CAN DO IT!”	 42.621017373241344
The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen’s shoulder.	 44.44079874467593
—I want you to write something for me, he said. Something with a bite	 42.27074281929127
in it. You can do it. I see it in your face. _In the lexicon of	 29.601626151592743
youth_...	 16744.376214788223
See it in your face. See it in your eye. Lazy idle little schemer.	 76.11413766449041
—Foot and mouth disease! the editor cried in scornful invective. Great	 35.682931172163215
nationalist meeting in Borris-in-Ossory. All balls! Bulldosing the	 28.374481259375692
public! Give them something with a bite in it. Put us all into it, damn	 179.66688752014394
its soul. Father, Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes M’Carthy.	 91.10883590459085
—We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr O’Madden Burke said.	 26.457232674648075
Stephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare.	 53.05354177874355
—He wants you for the pressgang, J. J. O’Molloy said.	 21.67047282101972
THE GREAT GALLAHER	 82.67360031816119
—You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in	 36.40251563879546
emphasis. Wait a minute. We’ll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher	 116.21026751485151
used to say when he was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the	 30.429748433876465
Clarence. Gallaher, that was a pressman for you. That was a pen. You	 49.95818556003187
know how he made his mark? I’ll tell you. That was the smartest piece	 44.344517826082836
of journalism ever known. That was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of	 66.03454123939663
the invincibles, murder in the Phoenix park, before you were born, I	 34.59716453255632
suppose. I’ll show you.	 111.97161591115471
He pushed past them to the files.	 70.57512607474553
—Look at here, he said turning. The _New York World_ cabled for a	 30.930288825850557
special. Remember that time?	 498.059992637079
Professor MacHugh nodded.	 26.4539166707096
—_New York World_, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his straw	 67.69693341031366
hat. Where it took place. Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean. Joe Brady and	 95.88774837954354
the rest of them. Where Skin-the-Goat drove the car. Whole route, see?	 104.1020149446496
—Skin-the-Goat, Mr O’Madden Burke said. Fitzharris. He has that	 14.447841271232429
cabman’s shelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge. Holohan told me.	 52.471558413989605
You know Holohan?	 52.784520385986625
—Hop and carry one, is it? Myles Crawford said.	 17.050004086377182
—And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones for	 86.01587304905792
the corporation. A night watchman.	 127.52265702828491
Stephen turned in surprise.	 113.07045287548323
—Gumley? he said. You don’t say so? A friend of my father’s, is it?	 67.90792386014188
—Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily. Let Gumley mind the	 77.17833479337291
stones, see they don’t run away. Look at here. What did Ignatius	 136.33334759873955
Gallaher do? I’ll tell you. Inspiration of genius. Cabled right away.	 95.05997080434487
Have you _Weekly Freeman_ of 17 March? Right. Have you got that?	 136.45966240459148
He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point.	 69.86958762486312
—Take page four, advertisement for Bransome’s coffee, let us say. Have	 160.6864430407536
you got that? Right.	 127.12108550916751
The telephone whirred.	 25.91084772968373
A DISTANT VOICE	 232.82016446004462
—I’ll answer it, the professor said, going.	 66.45363969930008
—B is parkgate. Good.	 363.04771640488815
His finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating.	 191.9987939828794
—T is viceregal lodge. C is where murder took place. K is Knockmaroon	 147.4014710122571
gate.	 5697.492258208136
The loose flesh of his neck shook like a cock’s wattles. An illstarched	 39.11844418487796
dicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his	 22.85131529703779
waistcoat.	 11764.096692298395
—Hello? _Evening Telegraph_ here... Hello?... Who’s there?... Yes...	 53.09170092236636
Yes... Yes.	 51.775750238693824
—F to P is the route Skin-the-Goat drove the car for an alibi,	 116.9528645193
Inchicore, Roundtown, Windy Arbour, Palmerston Park, Ranelagh. F.A.B.P.	 9.013959712335721
Got that? X is Davy’s publichouse in upper Leeson street.	 42.89033003370821
The professor came to the inner door.	 44.584558386534866
—Bloom is at the telephone, he said.	 63.99932878512472
—Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly. X is Davy’s	 45.890970416712285
publichouse, see?	 115.70784414981662
CLEVER, VERY	 1005.0285102563463
—Clever, Lenehan said. Very.	 79.44301460344104
—Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloody	 57.720929589231794
history.	 2295.8803112932715
Nightmare from which you will never awake.	 40.036252261352516
—I saw it, the editor said proudly. I was present. Dick Adams, the	 31.202513684492864
besthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, and	 70.51255951227516
myself.	 11937.827407615549
Lenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing:	 44.66719686953822
—Madam, I’m Adam. And Able was I ere I saw Elba.	 95.79395703282907
—History! Myles Crawford cried. The Old Woman of Prince’s street was	 35.22681900598043
there first. There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that. Out of	 111.96097998236269
an advertisement. Gregor Grey made the design for it. That gave him the	 126.96511438379424
leg up. Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the _Star._	 228.49722701323768
Now he’s got in with Blumenfeld. That’s press. That’s talent. Pyatt! He	 108.21953804743335
was all their daddies!	 55.37584710649321
—The father of scare journalism, Lenehan confirmed, and the	 24.304843940034143
brother-in-law of Chris Callinan.	 143.52022886319492
—Hello?... Are you there?... Yes, he’s here still. Come across	 204.89521977096615
yourself.	 3727.054157568163
—Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh? the editor cried.	 38.95682864521946
He flung the pages down.	 101.37494016746308
—Clamn dever, Lenehan said to Mr O’Madden Burke.	 20.38722169992589
—Very smart, Mr O’Madden Burke said.	 33.91495343141714
Professor MacHugh came from the inner office.	 27.839309707878495
—Talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some hawkers	 45.90516335180411
were up before the recorder...	 186.796784912963
—O yes, J. J. O’Molloy said eagerly. Lady Dudley was walking home	 31.82668546540617
through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that	 97.30436401532765
cyclone last year and thought she’d buy a view of Dublin. And it turned	 65.17945094132259
out to be a commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or	 63.79258667553523
Skin-the-Goat. Right outside the viceregal lodge, imagine!	 67.51200740628144
—They’re only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said.	 79.99278922663605
Psha! Press and the bar! Where have you a man now at the bar like those	 59.601258840064546
fellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O’Hagan.	 103.90728354954726
Eh? Ah, bloody nonsense. Psha! Only in the halfpenny place.	 71.49001327282838
His mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain.	 22.6121156685722
Would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss? How do you know? Why did you	 51.58744546763881
write it then?	 371.9466708873828
RHYMES AND REASONS	 42.686719973592304
Mouth, south. Is the mouth south someway? Or the south a mouth? Must be	 74.86807340369461
some. South, pout, out, shout, drouth. Rhymes: two men dressed the	 124.85473567505548
same, looking the same, two by two.	 212.6433420116203

He saw them three by three, approaching girls, in green, in rose, in	 208.22652932962183
russet, entwining, _per l’aer perso_, in mauve, in purple, _quella	 25.439041618539633

—Speak up for yourself, Mr O’Madden Burke said.	 60.487438039608946
SUFFICIENT FOR THE DAY...	 27.270120862857297
J. J. O’Molloy, smiling palely, took up the gage.	 19.28267308420911
—My dear Myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a false	 135.4768274615971
construction on my words. I hold no brief, as at present advised, for	 93.0587200498867
the third profession _qua_ profession but your Cork legs are running	 93.63466444243525
away with you. Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes	 97.68176382672456
and Edmund Burke? Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod	 83.32259849789808
boss, Harmsworth of the farthing press, and his American cousin of the	 35.85509306174621
Bowery guttersheet not to mention _Paddy Kelly’s Budget_, _Pue’s	 36.998814293266804
Occurrences_ and our watchful friend _The Skibbereen Eagle_. Why bring	 46.918783534658964
in a master of forensic eloquence like Whiteside? Sufficient for the	 29.70646446257721
day is the newspaper thereof.	 115.60260735660842
LINKS WITH BYGONE DAYS OF YORE	 79.66836651166622
—Grattan and Flood wrote for this very paper, the editor cried in his	 51.79675366220906
face. Irish volunteers. Where are you now? Established 1763. Dr Lucas.	 86.74895648342304
Who have you now like John Philpot Curran? Psha!	 57.044312456536936
—Well, J. J. O’Molloy said, Bushe K.C., for example.	 26.37550313547927
—Bushe? the editor said. Well, yes: Bushe, yes. He has a strain of it	 51.17212665203612
in his blood. Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe.	 71.27351622695959
—He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, only for	 42.058834778142646
.... But no matter.	 122.47869192688663
J. J. O’Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly:	 28.840869969545608
—One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life	 53.23808875603827
fell from the lips of Seymour Bushe. It was in that case of fratricide,	 51.845892827049845
the Childs murder case. Bushe defended him.	 60.463144452673056
_And in the porches of mine ear did pour._	 36.72942282852226
By the way how did he find that out? He died in his sleep. Or the other	 54.35503391969768
story, beast with two backs?	 83.46284559182467
—What was that? the professor asked.	 31.676236889562176
ITALIA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM	 4.206040932916629
—He spoke on the law of evidence, J. J. O’Molloy said, of Roman justice	 49.8262948440134
as contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the _lex talionis_. And he	 14.48265764167597
cited the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican.	 15.405395821519306
—Ha.	 10084.11417616841
—A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced. Silence!	 182.96327901562088
Pause. J. J. O’Molloy took out his cigarettecase.	 10.85626533308571
False lull. Something quite ordinary.	 392.6309870165912
Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.	 91.97294755253394
I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that	 105.90546082057132
it was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match,	 90.88199656042114
that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives.	 66.22960676703948
A POLISHED PERIOD	 67.4047423937428
J. J. O’Molloy resumed, moulding his words:	 24.860096075979428
—He said of it: _that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and	 74.95083673375825
terrible, of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and	 117.82743782950442
of prophecy which, if aught that the imagination or the hand of	 81.48612361175206
sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of	 17.076729608501875
soultransfiguring deserves to live, deserves to live._	 34.95862268977987
His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.	 109.93739613760565
—Fine! Myles Crawford said at once.	 29.157507411862206
—The divine afflatus, Mr O’Madden Burke said.	 18.603743437064395
—You like it? J. J. O’Molloy asked Stephen.	 24.96999055527584
Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed. He	 74.99257796344241
took a cigarette from the case. J. J. O’Molloy offered his case to	 54.76831527159691
Myles Crawford. Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his	 99.12296562336543
trophy, saying:	 185.22971828214648
—Muchibus thankibus.	 4.411654744205047
A MAN OF HIGH MORALE	 58.82190736510906
—Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J. J. O’Molloy said	 52.823185618846175
to Stephen. What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal	 51.04296497784748
hush poets: A. E. the mastermystic? That Blavatsky woman started it.	 165.6030773488559
She was a nice old bag of tricks. A. E. has been telling some yankee	 48.432814154969805
interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to	 74.22078553800321
ask him about planes of consciousness. Magennis thinks you must have	 51.07991404452674
been pulling A. E.’s leg. He is a man of the very highest morale,	 33.49281163343884
Magennis.	 4.608171674364364
Speaking about me. What did he say? What did he say? What did he say	 37.798665564606374
about me? Don’t ask.	 187.20476958969124
—No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside.	 39.278166546800804
Wait a moment. Let me say one thing. The finest display of oratory I	 55.30692828370702
ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical	 81.55762153160165
society. Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had	 366.85559758637163
spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days),	 112.97304172689611
advocating the revival of the Irish tongue.	 18.744160218075443
He turned towards Myles Crawford and said:	 66.59804929711065
—You know Gerald Fitzgibbon. Then you can imagine the style of his	 45.49106095069203
discourse.	 4.608171674364364
—He is sitting with Tim Healy, J. J. O’Molloy said, rumour has it, on	 24.227300984664804
the Trinity college estates commission.	 35.15273927148996
—He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child’s	 38.3276218379805
frock. Go on. Well?	 68.16047841813447
—It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator,	 45.32861019970208
full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will	 31.216590100084733
not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man’s contumely	 41.807547123346936
upon the new movement. It was then a new movement. We were weak,	 44.186108761329095
therefore worthless.	 174.71724018419692
He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an	 90.45927534043241
outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and	 41.39561315104202
ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new	 75.74202315708486
focus.	 4.608171674364364
IMPROMPTU	 4.608171674364364
In ferial tone he addressed J. J. O’Molloy:	 27.85678243955657
—Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed. That he had	 74.75589233156556
prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one	 56.72136608722378
shorthandwriter in the hall. His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy	 40.69566844249921
beard round it. He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he	 70.25663469782702
looked (though he was not) a dying man.	 68.49628770854667
His gaze turned at once but slowly from J. J. O’Molloy’s towards	 98.36224698739949
Stephen’s face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking. His	 51.532043875219316
unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his	 47.80074630292161
withering hair. Still seeking, he said:	 65.14974985511404
—When Fitzgibbon’s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply.	 167.93252383660408
Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.	 43.4565048027522
He raised his head firmly. His eyes bethought themselves once more.	 38.375799621449175
Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.	 10.065451494665403
He began:	 99.57516565792203
_—Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in	 89.08458291000788
listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment	 54.83034352781284
since by my learned friend. It seemed to me that I had been transported	 62.471357698206106
into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this	 131.71997402968844
age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the	 73.1109234841104
speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful	 51.49720488454846
Moses._	 3951.079191913059
His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes	 51.208879834401905
ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech. _And let our	 30.08068495050936
crooked smokes._ Noble words coming. Look out. Could you try your hand	 142.82332140950413
at it yourself?	 213.34294410068824
_—And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian	 36.279218719659085
highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride. I heard	 79.13005523101498
his words and their meaning was revealed to me._	 69.67090856618866
FROM THE FATHERS	 213.4166973748175
It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are	 78.13645782744221
corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they	 60.79748248943689
were good could be corrupted. Ah, curse you! That’s saint Augustine.	 260.30868712158474
_—Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our	 87.39370488161323
language? You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people.	 85.91077304495724
You have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and	 55.642506045734095
our galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise	 23.336372526709624
furrow the waters of the known globe. You have but emerged from	 52.362566077070895
primitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong	 29.628587472068006
history and a polity._	 68.02662793272938

Child, man, effigy.	 432.9271745960408
By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple	 43.3722450922151
in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.	 47.33565614815453
_—You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and	 27.071080969445866
mysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra.	 25.483830790465202
Yours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas. Israel is	 93.3199922670894
weak and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her	 218.215814206679
arms. Vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at	 57.27791859307429
our name._	 480.55743998552833
A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech. He lifted his voice above it	 25.41712238561701
boldly:	 22002.532851485295
_—But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and	 149.20291553522392
accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will	 106.89192942336207
and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never	 70.8936440122104
have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor	 72.59768951977786
followed the pillar of the cloud by day. He would never have spoken	 75.3526632248411
with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai’s mountaintop nor ever have	 53.76320878475436
come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and	 55.00963042966659
bearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of	 61.76026403174373
the outlaw._	 7.77559996992721
He ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence.	 61.12861495324306
OMINOUS—FOR HIM!	 45.15518483009432
J. J. O’Molloy said not without regret:	 16.715874839998655
—And yet he died without having entered the land of promise.	 91.67607070087787
—A—sudden—at—the—moment—though—from—lingering—illness—often—previously—	 4.608171674364364
expectorated—demise, Lenehan added. And with a great future behind him.	 42.498544756254915
The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and	 61.44874309920446
pattering up the staircase.	 41.99477762209605
—That is oratory, the professor said uncontradicted.	 18.609542480012326
Gone with the wind. Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings. Miles	 60.76813959591534
of ears of porches. The tribune’s words, howled and scattered to the	 30.756766074708935
four winds. A people sheltered within his voice. Dead noise. Akasic	 122.60935333009854
records of all that ever anywhere wherever was. Love and laud him: me	 52.692051861162255
no more.	 78.80132460512498
I have money.	 74.28254367231796
—Gentlemen, Stephen said. As the next motion on the agenda paper may I	 53.480986575393544
suggest that the house do now adjourn?	 163.57887592050142
—You take my breath away. It is not perchance a French compliment? Mr	 89.01120209782964
O’Madden Burke asked. ’Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug,	 44.07888527362564
metaphorically speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry.	 76.36209220789398
—That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved. All that are in favour	 79.19750960400614
say ay, Lenehan announced. The contrary no. I declare it carried. To	 165.04013225421596
which particular boosing shed...? My casting vote is: Mooney’s!	 87.13425823433117
He led the way, admonishing:	 78.8239875174196
—We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not? Yes,	 82.3909694749529
we will not. By no manner of means.	 127.99574262075983
Mr O’Madden Burke, following close, said with an ally’s lunge of his	 31.620792997701734
umbrella:	 19150.381167385138
—Lay on, Macduff!	 125.85241701100983
—Chip of the old block! the editor cried, clapping Stephen on the	 21.25285855948476
shoulder. Let us go. Where are those blasted keys?	 79.2204575011752
He fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets.	 21.451897415000555
—Foot and mouth. I know. That’ll be all right. That’ll go in. Where are	 79.57246045339319
they? That’s all right.	 84.52534067494196
He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office.	 29.268920063595974
LET US HOPE	 86.516812592888
J. J. O’Molloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen:	 59.60571971186057
—I hope you will live to see it published. Myles, one moment.	 94.32967239066355
He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.	 26.15701329860112
—Come along, Stephen, the professor said. That is fine, isn’t it? It	 75.74654644083758
has the prophetic vision. _Fuit Ilium!_ The sack of windy Troy.	 52.162864505727605
Kingdoms of this world. The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen	 27.190089633105245
today.	 4285.98547768333
The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and	 49.86186173670509
rushed out into the street, yelling:	 40.16507003774476
—Racing special!	 98.38208651599916
Dublin. I have much, much to learn.	 165.32182866241217
They turned to the left along Abbey street.	 35.40244126544639
—I have a vision too, Stephen said.	 38.160638226865125
—Yes? the professor said, skipping to get into step. Crawford will	 70.09864971011805
follow.	 6235.073000540129
Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran:	 167.0630179080677
—Racing special!	 98.38208651599916
DEAR DIRTY DUBLIN	 461.67901440421105
Dubliners.	 4.608171674364364
—Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fifty	 102.99196171478583
and fiftythree years in Fumbally’s lane.	 72.30795881616258
—Where is that? the professor asked.	 36.399082651820045
—Off Blackpitts, Stephen said.	 65.60864665940842
Damp night reeking of hungry dough. Against the wall. Face glistering	 102.34115578016446
tallow under her fustian shawl. Frantic hearts. Akasic records.	 41.94073671283585
Quicker, darlint!	 4.411654744205047
On now. Dare it. Let there be life.	 377.5109583991449
—They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson’s pillar.	 21.88390159648129
They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox. They	 72.11209409623095
shake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies	 66.87757580531289
with the blade of a knife. Two and three in silver and one and seven in	 131.74667363347078
coppers. They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their	 55.398550014124
umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.	 62.98548995159641
—Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said.	 27.66513100186578
LIFE ON THE RAW	 242.57810448268384
—They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at	 38.2879866559339
the north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate	 50.95021604908798
Collins, proprietress... They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from	 53.60047361937842
a girl at the foot of Nelson’s pillar to take off the thirst of the	 29.76809328506009
brawn. They give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile	 125.73029535075152
and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting,	 37.97570371607977
encouraging each other, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the	 41.69564636638898
other have you the brawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin,	 96.78033073100326
threatening to come down, peeping at the airslits. Glory be to God.	 79.70923330687401
They had no idea it was that high.	 83.95588369347662
Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe. Anne Kearns has the	 24.87449914086479
lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a lady who	 62.51412997911314
got a bottleful from a passionist father. Florence MacCabe takes a	 51.73806449948668
crubeen and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.	 61.87509039397552
—Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice. Vestal virgins. I can	 51.679840822839985
see them. What’s keeping our friend?	 113.6530362264464
He turned.	 32.184482385959534
A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in all	 30.41772434546929
directions, yelling, their white papers fluttering. Hard after them	 118.45369652182954
Myles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet	 61.56061324965879
face, talking with J. J. O’Molloy.	 44.19330241605026
—Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm.	 31.36957637758856
He set off again to walk by Stephen’s side.	 82.87505375204198
RETURN OF BLOOM	 357.6053268010245
—Yes, he said. I see them.	 36.77656666450994
Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the	 38.498956463435775
offices of the _Irish Catholic_ and _Dublin Penny Journal_, called:	 164.89317178615266
—Mr Crawford! A moment!	 360.7545029233534
—_Telegraph_! Racing special!	 40.43494395119566
—What is it? Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace.	 25.79583551130846
A newsboy cried in Mr Bloom’s face:	 52.71195259034205
—Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows!	 171.62154091195754
INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR	 34.659051046820814
—Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps,	 53.46812025401477
puffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket. I spoke with Mr Keyes	 46.49670917291137
just now. He’ll give a renewal for two months, he says. After he’ll	 76.49801748434315
see. But he wants a par to call attention in the _Telegraph_ too, the	 81.34991107467019
Saturday pink. And he wants it copied if it’s not too late I told	 105.7995470405114
councillor Nannetti from the _Kilkenny People_. I can have access to it	 46.35470851843464
in the national library. House of keys, don’t you see? His name is	 22.75535473265214
Keyes. It’s a play on the name. But he practically promised he’d give	 107.23084633979711
the renewal. But he wants just a little puff. What will I tell him, Mr	 53.15064597346965
Crawford?	 15961.84660739075
K.M.A.	 4.608171674364364
—Will you tell him he can kiss my arse? Myles Crawford said throwing	 26.278975419142697
out his arm for emphasis. Tell him that straight from the stable.	 54.17331876638884
A bit nervy. Look out for squalls. All off for a drink. Arm in arm.	 70.22403680307531
Lenehan’s yachting cap on the cadge beyond. Usual blarney. Wonder is	 32.831332245070804
that young Dedalus the moving spirit. Has a good pair of boots on him	 104.70502591221356
today. Last time I saw him he had his heels on view. Been walking in	 74.99544741869722
muck somewhere. Careless chap. What was he doing in Irishtown?	 95.1714262959624
—Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design I	 34.107701606798074
suppose it’s worth a short par. He’d give the ad, I think. I’ll tell	 48.501798911735925
him...	 330.5397417229756
K.M.R.I.A.	 4.608171674364364
—He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over his	 31.86212039302695
shoulder. Any time he likes, tell him.	 87.70423069023427
While Mr Bloom stood weighing the point and about to smile he strode on	 105.06613002015031
jerkily.	 4.608171674364364
RAISING THE WIND	 289.72948632066334
—_Nulla bona_, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin. I’m up to	 39.5351929661585
here. I’ve been through the hoop myself. I was looking for a fellow to	 69.43173761530306
back a bill for me no later than last week. Sorry, Jack. You must take	 97.53495606339767
the will for the deed. With a heart and a half if I could raise the	 60.57396579935869
wind anyhow.	 882.8995854101817
J. J. O’Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently. They caught	 47.26118464600196
up on the others and walked abreast.	 64.86748588609305
—When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty	 59.29491090609306
fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the	 64.3433078188044
railings.	 23854.45434594273
—Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford. Two old	 96.93195732780713
Dublin women on the top of Nelson’s pillar.	 61.44609750780521
SOME COLUMN!—THAT’S WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID	 185.1827398467942
—That’s new, Myles Crawford said. That’s copy. Out for the waxies’	 31.129238516038384
Dargle. Two old trickies, what?	 49.80824433241345
—But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on. They see	 181.80739674239604
the roofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines’	 35.57735171443179
blue dome, Adam and Eve’s, saint Laurence O’Toole’s. But it makes them	 53.80770627404369
giddy to look so they pull up their skirts...	 111.61010922419865
THOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES	 253.88638555032747
—Easy all, Myles Crawford said. No poetic licence. We’re in the	 91.70534187940868
archdiocese here.	 85.12154925584635
—And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue	 50.88898771827555
of the onehandled adulterer.	 8.960834382765187
—Onehandled adulterer! the professor cried. I like that. I see the	 40.91671158352921
idea. I see what you mean.	 60.62083123126545
DAMES DONATE DUBLIN’S CITS SPEEDPILLS VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS, BELIEF	 22.952284055552187
—It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are too	 39.91062193507625
tired to look up or down or to speak. They put the bag of plums between	 145.78319037809857
them and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with	 97.10987684056687
their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and	 23.301520721724778
spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings.	 133.41311627406398
He gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close. Lenehan and Mr O’Madden	 119.84517886726705
Burke, hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooney’s.	 227.233207865178
—Finished? Myles Crawford said. So long as they do no worse.	 74.54365067660959
SOPHIST WALLOPS HAUGHTY HELEN SQUARE ON PROBOSCIS. SPARTANS GNASH	 35.58795639039721
MOLARS. ITHACANS VOW PEN IS CHAMP.	 21.95226436380776
—You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple of	 24.36441078034061
Gorgias, the sophist. It is said of him that none could tell if he were	 66.00359486256471
bitterer against others or against himself. He was the son of a noble	 90.69085724475208
and a bondwoman. And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of	 41.31900208452448
beauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope.	 130.63001667288836
Poor Penelope. Penelope Rich.	 51.48976878628863
They made ready to cross O’Connell street.	 118.86116324625768
HELLO THERE, CENTRAL!	 181.84908758009183
At various points along the eight lines tramcars with motionless	 71.16138326785969
trolleys stood in their tracks, bound for or from Rathmines,	 131.9975576861054
Rathfarnham, Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Sandymount Green,	 38.02032193988306
Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Donnybrook, Palmerston Park and Upper	 55.359253535567355
Rathmines, all still, becalmed in short circuit. Hackney cars, cabs,	 46.14033123751639
delivery waggons, mailvans, private broughams, aerated mineral water	 22.541070641826728
floats with rattling crates of bottles, rattled, rolled, horsedrawn,	 95.66125693774498
rapidly.	 12393.822616391586
WHAT?—AND LIKEWISE—WHERE?	 4.411654744205047
—But what do you call it? Myles Crawford asked. Where did they get the	 21.101337257330915
plums?	 8359.808907327431
VIRGILIAN, SAYS PEDAGOGUE. SOPHOMORE PLUMPS FOR OLD MAN MOSES.	 46.14239263287699
—Call it, wait, the professor said, opening his long lips wide to	 68.29241361182781
reflect. Call it, let me see. Call it: _deus nobis hæc otia fecit._	 25.614284308894682
—No, Stephen said. I call it _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The	 31.73123642409296
Parable of The Plums._	 34.48453355753085
—I see, the professor said.	 17.513763465156366
He laughed richly.	 40.99577217690833
—I see, he said again with new pleasure. Moses and the promised land.	 53.106200580815766
We gave him that idea, he added to J. J. O’Molloy.	 40.30624070453856
HORATIO IS CYNOSURE THIS FAIR JUNE DAY	 123.41216752906354
J. J. O’Molloy sent a weary sidelong glance towards the statue and held	 36.61492432216916
his peace.	 146.28047872939618
—I see, the professor said.	 17.513763465156366
He halted on sir John Gray’s pavement island and peered aloft at Nelson	 47.84406720813237
through the meshes of his wry smile.	 25.26369546569664

—Onehandled adulterer, he said smiling grimly. That tickles me, I must	 32.00145077323871
say.	 957.1327818468302
—Tickled the old ones too, Myles Crawford said, if the God Almighty’s	 85.84070041981356

jujubes white.	 87.52265461541249
A sombre Y. M. C. A. young man, watchful among the warm sweet fumes of	 34.66035781384615
Graham Lemon’s, placed a throwaway in a hand of Mr Bloom.	 60.62484325806806
Heart to heart talks.	 93.95589934897764
Bloo... Me? No.	 371.97183231081914
Blood of the Lamb.	 101.70076906794957
His slow feet walked him riverward, reading. Are you saved? All are	 156.45228196920755
washed in the blood of the lamb. God wants blood victim. Birth, hymen,	 134.57538166833427
martyr, war, foundation of a building, sacrifice, kidney burntoffering,	 52.83178631763343
druids’ altars. Elijah is coming. Dr John Alexander Dowie restorer of	 36.980014693622245
the church in Zion is coming.	 67.23809907743635
Is coming! Is coming!! Is coming!!!	 169.05772427265734
All heartily welcome.	 250.75109307258143
Paying game. Torry and Alexander last year. Polygamy. His wife will put	 82.90714583586875
the stopper on that. Where was that ad some Birmingham firm the	 59.549310211076396
luminous crucifix. Our Saviour. Wake up in the dead of night and see	 44.86737466446513
him on the wall, hanging. Pepper’s ghost idea. Iron Nails Ran In.	 93.20825957963095
Phosphorus it must be done with. If you leave a bit of codfish for	 34.46725788913779
instance. I could see the bluey silver over it. Night I went down to	 59.79210128808781
the pantry in the kitchen. Don’t like all the smells in it waiting to	 75.6932741528999
rush out. What was it she wanted? The Malaga raisins. Thinking of	 78.74730985633556
Spain. Before Rudy was born. The phosphorescence, that bluey greeny.	 57.33468916542312
Very good for the brain.	 111.53432139427574
From Butler’s monument house corner he glanced along Bachelor’s walk.	 50.74206984385267
Dedalus’ daughter there still outside Dillon’s auctionrooms. Must be	 204.64746468447154
selling off some old furniture. Knew her eyes at once from the father.	 115.83039075367769
Lobbing about waiting for him. Home always breaks up when the mother	 91.08458203658594
goes. Fifteen children he had. Birth every year almost. That’s in their	 247.43348462644346
theology or the priest won’t give the poor woman the confession, the	 74.18227142231966
absolution. Increase and multiply. Did you ever hear such an idea? Eat	 84.35504416731101
you out of house and home. No families themselves to feed. Living on	 120.00530241746758
the fat of the land. Their butteries and larders. I’d like to see them	 46.88456262141995
do the black fast Yom Kippur. Crossbuns. One meal and a collation for	 48.70402702532999
fear he’d collapse on the altar. A housekeeper of one of those fellows	 46.250468821069575
if you could pick it out of her. Never pick it out of her. Like getting	 35.947578040273505
£. s. d. out of him. Does himself well. No guests. All for number one.	 64.17883207834235
Watching his water. Bring your own bread and butter. His reverence:	 170.3164441189124
mum’s the word.	 36.474856210649925
Good Lord, that poor child’s dress is in flitters. Underfed she looks	 86.2186664851287
too. Potatoes and marge, marge and potatoes. It’s after they feel it.	 52.82507250014775
Proof of the pudding. Undermines the constitution.	 16.147712575341107
As he set foot on O’Connell bridge a puffball of smoke plumed up from	 45.44638130676522
the parapet. Brewery barge with export stout. England. Sea air sours	 97.64433427564582
it, I heard. Be interesting some day get a pass through Hancock to see	 98.12071744373591
the brewery. Regular world in itself. Vats of porter wonderful. Rats	 76.22441831031131
get in too. Drink themselves bloated as big as a collie floating. Dead	 109.4371687632754
drunk on the porter. Drink till they puke again like christians.	 157.78269048651373
Imagine drinking that! Rats: vats. Well, of course, if we knew all the	 55.31796368953017
things.	 6033.715550817363
Looking down he saw flapping strongly, wheeling between the gaunt	 37.748106491279
quaywalls, gulls. Rough weather outside. If I threw myself down? Reuben	 160.4532417245592
J’s son must have swallowed a good bellyful of that sewage. One and	 44.837860961556395
eightpence too much. Hhhhm. It’s the droll way he comes out with the	 39.267065801419236
things. Knows how to tell a story too.	 135.35495700139245
They wheeled lower. Looking for grub. Wait.	 102.64514563786166
He threw down among them a crumpled paper ball. Elijah thirtytwo feet	 43.34490062336976
per sec is com. Not a bit. The ball bobbed unheeded on the wake of	 55.45342259751826
swells, floated under by the bridgepiers. Not such damn fools. Also the	 167.38892076364
day I threw that stale cake out of the Erin’s King picked it up in the	 36.12764480362093
wake fifty yards astern. Live by their wits. They wheeled, flapping.	 117.24791465341133
The hungry famished gull	 34.56551509423289
Flaps o’er the waters dull.	 45.10077828528481
That is how poets write, the similar sounds. But then Shakespeare has	 101.57203432218046
no rhymes: blank verse. The flow of the language it is. The thoughts.	 98.13612921769095
Solemn.	 8791.16884238665
Hamlet, I am thy father’s spirit	 21.520359954950838
Doomed for a certain time to walk the earth.	 48.62984603389395
—Two apples a penny! Two for a penny!	 87.47592464459254
His gaze passed over the glazed apples serried on her stand.	 62.94545631532981
Australians they must be this time of year. Shiny peels: polishes them	 58.71279442586011
up with a rag or a handkerchief.	 69.00221985828165
Wait. Those poor birds.	 710.0730419820078
He halted again and bought from the old applewoman two Banbury cakes	 52.77051000522792
for a penny and broke the brittle paste and threw its fragments down	 48.195089898830545
into the Liffey. See that? The gulls swooped silently, two, then all	 261.8052026187511
from their heights, pouncing on prey. Gone. Every morsel.	 55.551523212745025
Aware of their greed and cunning he shook the powdery crumb from his	 28.537961863095802
hands. They never expected that. Manna. Live on fish, fishy flesh they	 165.27459109729776
have, all seabirds, gulls, seagoose. Swans from Anna Liffey swim down	 117.70344888465488
here sometimes to preen themselves. No accounting for tastes. Wonder	 103.84384425257922
what kind is swanmeat. Robinson Crusoe had to live on them.	 79.21960769181977
They wheeled flapping weakly. I’m not going to throw any more. Penny	 27.377043020513604
quite enough. Lot of thanks I get. Not even a caw. They spread foot and	 66.61376625745342
mouth disease too. If you cram a turkey say on chestnutmeal it tastes	 48.18755765747938
like that. Eat pig like pig. But then why is it that saltwater fish are	 90.16860284945261
not salty? How is that?	 65.68906553987149
His eyes sought answer from the river and saw a rowboat rock at anchor	 52.7297724612785
on the treacly swells lazily its plastered board.	 50.802375955790886
Kino’s	 4.608171674364364
11/—	 4.608171674364364
Trousers	 4091.603844469761
Good idea that. Wonder if he pays rent to the corporation. How can you	 63.69157596602469
own water really? It’s always flowing in a stream, never the same,	 168.81026656329752
which in the stream of life we trace. Because life is a stream. All	 64.98024842097531
kinds of places are good for ads. That quack doctor for the clap used	 118.38522395598532
to be stuck up in all the greenhouses. Never see it now. Strictly	 40.37420852413504
confidential. Dr Hy Franks. Didn’t cost him a red like Maginni the	 43.511260936071245
dancing master self advertisement. Got fellows to stick them up or	 159.8717773733391
stick them up himself for that matter on the q. t. running in to loosen	 104.35011600280414
a button. Flybynight. Just the place too. POST NO BILLS. POST 110	 96.01794793069739
PILLS. Some chap with a dose burning him.	 137.37172513404298
If he...?	 76.79569698725226
O!	 212.74943493418886
Eh?	 2102.2611206850243
No... No.	 91.94692994427932
No, no. I don’t believe it. He wouldn’t surely?	 54.4186698925967
No, no.	 91.94692994427932
Mr Bloom moved forward, raising his troubled eyes. Think no more about	 91.6609895596796
that. After one. Timeball on the ballastoffice is down. Dunsink time.	 74.68051484696326
Fascinating little book that is of sir Robert Ball’s. Parallax. I never	 83.83530980140293
exactly understood. There’s a priest. Could ask him. Par it’s Greek:	 82.92761287623394
parallel, parallax. Met him pike hoses she called it till I told her	 27.654574518606296
about the transmigration. O rocks!	 48.965604004421735
Mr Bloom smiled O rocks at two windows of the ballastoffice. She’s	 41.366098677293365
right after all. Only big words for ordinary things on account of the	 60.191360133784436
sound. She’s not exactly witty. Can be rude too. Blurt out what I was	 82.82464995997418
thinking. Still, I don’t know. She used to say Ben Dollard had a base	 60.24374503841198
barreltone voice. He has legs like barrels and you’d think he was	 128.21609165900554
singing into a barrel. Now, isn’t that wit. They used to call him big	 74.0145836677432
Ben. Not half as witty as calling him base barreltone. Appetite like an	 124.03555138019242
albatross. Get outside of a baron of beef. Powerful man he was at	 75.1804619741443
stowing away number one Bass. Barrel of Bass. See? It all works out.	 69.38110382406056
A procession of whitesmocked sandwichmen marched slowly towards him	 14.71554448820099
along the gutter, scarlet sashes across their boards. Bargains. Like	 56.26356766702316
that priest they are this morning: we have sinned: we have suffered. He	 51.0186397449672
read the scarlet letters on their five tall white hats: H. E. L. Y. S.	 62.168001703684794
Wisdom Hely’s. Y lagging behind drew a chunk of bread from under his	 35.161018042301016
foreboard, crammed it into his mouth and munched as he walked. Our	 40.168592709616206
staple food. Three bob a day, walking along the gutters, street after	 69.24111928774494
street. Just keep skin and bone together, bread and skilly. They are	 90.14603847902497
not Boyl: no, M’Glade’s men. Doesn’t bring in any business either. I	 102.63974103724752
suggested to him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls	 54.148887321033584
sitting inside writing letters, copybooks, envelopes, blottingpaper. I	 166.10046344242113
bet that would have caught on. Smart girls writing something catch the	 96.78490275255679
eye at once. Everyone dying to know what she’s writing. Get twenty of	 102.5682714413559
them round you if you stare at nothing. Have a finger in the pie. Women	 172.2479208932926
too. Curiosity. Pillar of salt. Wouldn’t have it of course because he	 63.122703748797406
didn’t think of it himself first. Or the inkbottle I suggested with a	 67.26573896709486
false stain of black celluloid. His ideas for ads like Plumtree’s	 87.07441735941711
potted under the obituaries, cold meat department. You can’t lick ’em.	 88.62149978938426
What? Our envelopes. Hello, Jones, where are you going? Can’t stop,	 76.83455685930761
Robinson, I am hastening to purchase the only reliable inkeraser	 66.04395011585727
_Kansell,_ sold by Hely’s Ltd, 85 Dame street. Well out of that ruck I	 44.39922495843483
am. Devil of a job it was collecting accounts of those convents.	 43.83516467683486
Tranquilla convent. That was a nice nun there, really sweet face.	 73.85644916522598
Wimple suited her small head. Sister? Sister? I am sure she was crossed	 86.26949409439975
in love by her eyes. Very hard to bargain with that sort of a woman. I	 83.40600957060498
disturbed her at her devotions that morning. But glad to communicate	 42.53761298612897
with the outside world. Our great day, she said. Feast of Our Lady of	 94.66835265706466
Mount Carmel. Sweet name too: caramel. She knew I, I think she knew by	 131.50721198240765
the way she. If she had married she would have changed. I suppose they	 79.06537990240969
really were short of money. Fried everything in the best butter all the	 115.0138830051105
same. No lard for them. My heart’s broke eating dripping. They like	 105.16645116782979
buttering themselves in and out. Molly tasting it, her veil up. Sister?	 139.58687716898038
Pat Claffey, the pawnbroker’s daughter. It was a nun they say invented	 60.00509657165725
barbed wire.	 143.00753976677254
He crossed Westmoreland street when apostrophe S had plodded by. Rover	 99.79868916679006
cycleshop. Those races are on today. How long ago is that? Year Phil	 66.97727127882128
Gilligan died. We were in Lombard street west. Wait: was in Thom’s. Got	 65.03617003007467
the job in Wisdom Hely’s year we married. Six years. Ten years ago:	 75.19107987641105
ninetyfour he died yes that’s right the big fire at Arnott’s. Val	 77.67994963082675
Dillon was lord mayor. The Glencree dinner. Alderman Robert O’Reilly	 87.99772777182521
emptying the port into his soup before the flag fell. Bobbob lapping it	 64.94091538239904
for the inner alderman. Couldn’t hear what the band played. For what we	 42.73575411190158
have already received may the Lord make us. Milly was a kiddy then.	 129.96625609063756
Molly had that elephantgrey dress with the braided frogs. Mantailored	 84.49428941481699
with selfcovered buttons. She didn’t like it because I sprained my	 85.178032444513
ankle first day she wore choir picnic at the Sugarloaf. As if that. Old	 79.66505641056077
Goodwin’s tall hat done up with some sticky stuff. Flies’ picnic too.	 245.66744625792276
Never put a dress on her back like it. Fitted her like a glove,	 56.70394008513402
shoulders and hips. Just beginning to plump it out well. Rabbitpie we	 107.58008212856078
had that day. People looking after her.	 135.93994169118167
Happy. Happier then. Snug little room that was with the red wallpaper.	 88.51702685195251
Dockrell’s, one and ninepence a dozen. Milly’s tubbing night. American	 41.62052374622697
soap I bought: elderflower. Cosy smell of her bathwater. Funny she	 105.40944389055784
looked soaped all over. Shapely too. Now photography. Poor papa’s	 125.98511421808698
daguerreotype atelier he told me of. Hereditary taste.	 52.510369543916546
He walked along the curbstone.	 28.39720483386008
Stream of life. What was the name of that priestylooking chap was	 66.07944652164261
always squinting in when he passed? Weak eyes, woman. Stopped in	 87.79295267452463
Citron’s saint Kevin’s parade. Pen something. Pendennis? My memory is	 95.35296120651421
getting. Pen ...? Of course it’s years ago. Noise of the trams	 75.87838000595954
probably. Well, if he couldn’t remember the dayfather’s name that he	 54.25550708831652
sees every day.	 268.57600508725756
Bartell d’Arcy was the tenor, just coming out then. Seeing her home	 68.33266534005517
after practice. Conceited fellow with his waxedup moustache. Gave her	 62.43022350460652
that song _Winds that blow from the south_.	 113.65834990883049
Windy night that was I went to fetch her there was that lodge meeting	 57.307901517677884
on about those lottery tickets after Goodwin’s concert in the	 121.82058628941648
supperroom or oakroom of the Mansion house. He and I behind. Sheet of	 56.72308546106472
her music blew out of my hand against the High school railings. Lucky	 40.13413693840159
it didn’t. Thing like that spoils the effect of a night for her.	 70.8172876894341
Professor Goodwin linking her in front. Shaky on his pins, poor old	 87.39354817179073
sot. His farewell concerts. Positively last appearance on any stage.	 101.62108943561063
May be for months and may be for never. Remember her laughing at the	 115.97148467807963
wind, her blizzard collar up. Corner of Harcourt road remember that	 122.14165034149316
gust. Brrfoo! Blew up all her skirts and her boa nearly smothered old	 69.52838605196727
Goodwin. She did get flushed in the wind. Remember when we got home	 73.20739622675812
raking up the fire and frying up those pieces of lap of mutton for her	 71.18679901630627
supper with the Chutney sauce she liked. And the mulled rum. Could see	 89.03238378709678
her in the bedroom from the hearth unclamping the busk of her stays:	 16.469784774245507
white.	 1992.019476022999
Swish and soft flop her stays made on the bed. Always warm from her.	 64.42145168630697
Always liked to let her self out. Sitting there after till near two	 177.1500389721202
taking out her hairpins. Milly tucked up in beddyhouse. Happy. Happy.	 127.79608888230297
That was the night...	 46.54810982033633
—O, Mr Bloom, how do you do?	 36.677078525679185
—O, how do you do, Mrs Breen?	 22.086023100677266
—No use complaining. How is Molly those times? Haven’t seen her for	 83.98615348506516
ages.	 6153.722697998118
—In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily. Milly has a position down in	 94.20349372892788
Mullingar, you know.	 190.7111567447158
—Go away! Isn’t that grand for her?	 96.68263329322947
—Yes. In a photographer’s there. Getting on like a house on fire. How	 102.57469717476934
are all your charges?	 57.400216905532915
—All on the baker’s list, Mrs Breen said.	 60.05857640212756
How many has she? No other in sight.	 154.1179639286499
—You’re in black, I see. You have no...	 81.80695016393025
—No, Mr Bloom said. I have just come from a funeral.	 37.54019900607705
Going to crop up all day, I foresee. Who’s dead, when and what did he	 74.7201136634337
die of? Turn up like a bad penny.	 120.23112995687958
—O, dear me, Mrs Breen said. I hope it wasn’t any near relation.	 86.15142981929829
May as well get her sympathy.	 106.02792348026874
—Dignam, Mr Bloom said. An old friend of mine. He died quite suddenly,	 40.834980281144276
poor fellow. Heart trouble, I believe. Funeral was this morning.	 151.90489199251425
Your funeral’s tomorrow	 358.6654436928974
While you’re coming through the rye.	 50.73161218062621

—Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen’s womaneyes said melancholily.	 61.267911498019124
Now that’s quite enough about that. Just: quietly: husband.	 131.5366206065346
—And your lord and master?	 202.6148117315808
Mrs Breen turned up her two large eyes. Hasn’t lost them anyhow.	 97.34492516104454
—O, don’t be talking! she said. He’s a caution to rattlesnakes. He’s in	 44.464884086991454
there now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel. He has me	 33.93898367424479
heartscalded. Wait till I show you.	 16.260740812307148
Hot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured	 40.04260518668919
out from Harrison’s. The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom’s	 80.75147296374439
gullet. Want to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerara sugar,	 86.60051674922654
or they’d taste it with the hot tea. Or is it from her? A barefoot arab	 104.41063538690666
stood over the grating, breathing in the fumes. Deaden the gnaw of	 37.00259109536974
hunger that way. Pleasure or pain is it? Penny dinner. Knife and fork	 80.69957258034557
chained to the table.	 18.64291512386068
Opening her handbag, chipped leather. Hatpin: ought to have a guard on	 79.87955881506583
those things. Stick it in a chap’s eye in the tram. Rummaging. Open.	 79.25000939239288
Money. Please take one. Devils if they lose sixpence. Raise Cain.	 67.42653225917753
Husband barging. Where’s the ten shillings I gave you on Monday? Are	 100.04558657571438
you feeding your little brother’s family? Soiled handkerchief:	 117.20050901258047
medicinebottle. Pastille that was fell. What is she?...	 47.510621650910984
—There must be a new moon out, she said. He’s always bad then. Do you	 48.87757729111641
know what he did last night?	 50.0317242266005
Her hand ceased to rummage. Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in	 41.305326708747515
alarm, yet smiling.	 59.355442890886465
—What? Mr Bloom asked.	 28.55247188450611
Let her speak. Look straight in her eyes. I believe you. Trust me.	 74.8640129711404
—Woke me up in the night, she said. Dream he had, a nightmare.	 31.589298214701593
Indiges.	 4.608171674364364
—Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.	 66.8222284299151
—The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.	 16.396208869622033
She took a folded postcard from her handbag.	 29.145142811429235
—Read that, she said. He got it this morning.	 85.04221728777932
—What is it? Mr Bloom asked, taking the card. U. P.?	 27.07120688964756
—U. p: up, she said. Someone taking a rise out of him. It’s a great	 45.81518515508303
shame for them whoever he is.	 105.52960741614193
—Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.	 42.61455288669576
She took back the card, sighing.	 82.94566374070276
—And now he’s going round to Mr Menton’s office. He’s going to take an	 29.67652804825889
action for ten thousand pounds, he says.	 49.587397459953344
She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.	 86.37727109139747
Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching. Seen	 80.71092932212495
its best days. Wispish hair over her ears. And that dowdy toque: three	 96.52105149459163
old grapes to take the harm out of it. Shabby genteel. She used to be a	 25.786055700929143
tasty dresser. Lines round her mouth. Only a year or so older than	 83.94261215413388
Molly.	 2054.2518145680447
See the eye that woman gave her, passing. Cruel. The unfair sex.	 107.77209185104658
He looked still at her, holding back behind his look his discontent.	 58.25518571954016
Pungent mockturtle oxtail mulligatawny. I’m hungry too. Flakes of	 48.85680247871238
pastry on the gusset of her dress: daub of sugary flour stuck to her	 34.44571831838799
cheek. Rhubarb tart with liberal fillings, rich fruit interior. Josie	 26.92616945614573
Powell that was. In Luke Doyle’s long ago. Dolphin’s Barn, the	 15.10182088180377
charades. U. p: up.	 12.820020575835482
Change the subject.	 667.8964516246393
—Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy? Mr Bloom asked.	 41.088983070521806
—Mina Purefoy? she said.	 198.61043802113483
Philip Beaufoy I was thinking. Playgoers’ Club. Matcham often thinks of	 47.12232023240526
the masterstroke. Did I pull the chain? Yes. The last act.	 76.99649692090155
—Yes.	 220.63927910459736
—I just called to ask on the way in is she over it. She’s in the	 91.13782694007695
lying-in hospital in Holles street. Dr Horne got her in. She’s three	 97.08423125296912
days bad now.	 375.19027901952956
—O, Mr Bloom said. I’m sorry to hear that.	 19.24853970429374
—Yes, Mrs Breen said. And a houseful of kids at home. It’s a very stiff	 34.27987438523406
birth, the nurse told me.	 116.1742699525881
—O, Mr Bloom said.	 16.486067931957727
His heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news. His tongue clacked in	 92.40489892530255
compassion. Dth! Dth!	 32.264731083255825
—I’m sorry to hear that, he said. Poor thing! Three days! That’s	 61.733581690261204
terrible for her.	 287.8787326990842
Mrs Breen nodded.	 42.241173489392196
—She was taken bad on the Tuesday...	 113.45792597106636
Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her:	 38.610456542163206
—Mind! Let this man pass.	 743.5096426282521
A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a	 72.09252324875419
rapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass. Tight as a	 100.11788704717662
skullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head. From his arm a folded dustcoat,	 54.58150648730495
a stick and an umbrella dangled to his stride.	 36.11010875603526
—Watch him, Mr Bloom said. He always walks outside the lampposts.	 55.12890202801825
Watch!	 2711.78832421018
—Who is he if it’s a fair question? Mrs Breen asked. Is he dotty?	 54.61931213293537
—His name is Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, Mr	 9.982598214515498
Bloom said smiling. Watch!	 150.26557556688866
—He has enough of them, she said. Denis will be like that one of these	 49.97364827718712
days.	 2347.1916633893857
She broke off suddenly.	 119.61529683780692
—There he is, she said. I must go after him. Goodbye. Remember me to	 33.22236790379349
Molly, won’t you?	 120.6615118594709
—I will, Mr Bloom said.	 20.336250767078987
He watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts. Denis	 51.83556881003575
Breen in skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of	 85.68448362126004
Harrison’s hugging two heavy tomes to his ribs. Blown in from the bay.	 41.72757002143302
Like old times. He suffered her to overtake him without surprise and	 89.65239638360046
thrust his dull grey beard towards her, his loose jaw wagging as he	 116.9895033056463
spoke earnestly.	 3500.1257162322668
Meshuggah. Off his chump.	 19.12510244958565
Mr Bloom walked on again easily, seeing ahead of him in sunlight the	 37.11592949795647
tight skullpiece, the dangling stickumbrelladustcoat. Going the two	 191.04698958678821
days. Watch him! Out he goes again. One way of getting on in the world.	 106.50702890914557
And that other old mosey lunatic in those duds. Hard time she must have	 64.43794584310794
with him.	 77.73164388468649
U. p: up. I’ll take my oath that’s Alf Bergan or Richie Goulding. Wrote	 30.230445642541305
it for a lark in the Scotch house I bet anything. Round to Menton’s	 46.222354340606465
office. His oyster eyes staring at the postcard. Be a feast for the	 75.91909060986916
gods.	 18423.38058900307
He passed the _Irish Times_. There might be other answers lying there.	 74.45396094596646
Like to answer them all. Good system for criminals. Code. At their	 80.53397618807915
lunch now. Clerk with the glasses there doesn’t know me. O, leave them	 127.82528410071222
there to simmer. Enough bother wading through fortyfour of them.	 66.43929395618142
Wanted, smart lady typist to aid gentleman in literary work. I called	 128.29077376964463
you naughty darling because I do not like that other world. Please tell	 22.283699870818534
me what is the meaning. Please tell me what perfume does your wife.	 24.261840790561802
Tell me who made the world. The way they spring those questions on you.	 66.83053589876022
And the other one Lizzie Twigg. My literary efforts have had the good	 67.44221593448982
fortune to meet with the approval of the eminent poet A. E. (Mr Geo.	 41.02276947366421
Russell). No time to do her hair drinking sloppy tea with a book of	 89.59802234425791
poetry.	 18794.8135371824
Best paper by long chalks for a small ad. Got the provinces now. Cook	 137.2174302528384
and general, exc. cuisine, housemaid kept. Wanted live man for spirit	 223.43718258086741
counter. Resp. girl (R.C.) wishes to hear of post in fruit or pork	 127.73847797061956
shop. James Carlisle made that. Six and a half per cent dividend. Made	 170.6298605212041
a big deal on Coates’s shares. Ca’ canny. Cunning old Scotch hunks. All	 38.04373835729859
the toady news. Our gracious and popular vicereine. Bought the _Irish	 74.31282532664598
Field_ now. Lady Mountcashel has quite recovered after her confinement	 115.24910544131163
and rode out with the Ward Union staghounds at the enlargement	 48.77669605698126
yesterday at Rathoath. Uneatable fox. Pothunters too. Fear injects	 95.44213253024067
juices make it tender enough for them. Riding astride. Sit her horse	 154.20149545852706
like a man. Weightcarrying huntress. No sidesaddle or pillion for her,	 32.04276461139204
not for Joe. First to the meet and in at the death. Strong as a brood	 208.2112542047021
mare some of those horsey women. Swagger around livery stables. Toss	 168.57956293385158
off a glass of brandy neat while you’d say knife. That one at the	 85.60574418195365
Grosvenor this morning. Up with her on the car: wishswish. Stonewall or	 45.496936303195106
fivebarred gate put her mount to it. Think that pugnosed driver did it	 125.16918699769496
out of spite. Who is this she was like? O yes! Mrs Miriam Dandrade that	 54.258396487244624
sold me her old wraps and black underclothes in the Shelbourne hotel.	 49.823228101612784
Divorced Spanish American. Didn’t take a feather out of her my handling	 53.43325098789328
them. As if I was her clotheshorse. Saw her in the viceregal party when	 76.78804493424887
Stubbs the park ranger got me in with Whelan of the _Express._	 67.03800970951568
Scavenging what the quality left. High tea. Mayonnaise I poured on the	 84.09613919368019
plums thinking it was custard. Her ears ought to have tingled for a few	 49.23209682668553
weeks after. Want to be a bull for her. Born courtesan. No nursery work	 102.4034798238108
for her, thanks.	 207.97478270758285
Poor Mrs Purefoy! Methodist husband. Method in his madness. Saffron bun	 26.872305185019385
and milk and soda lunch in the educational dairy. Y. M. C. A. Eating	 45.63795037853046
with a stopwatch, thirtytwo chews to the minute. And still his	 52.99233723623549
muttonchop whiskers grew. Supposed to be well connected. Theodore’s	 36.43341065952034
cousin in Dublin Castle. One tony relative in every family. Hardy	 64.3785992307654
annuals he presents her with. Saw him out at the Three Jolly Topers	 58.94072597715915
marching along bareheaded and his eldest boy carrying one in a	 91.54792386261661
marketnet. The squallers. Poor thing! Then having to give the breast	 108.29855921895243
year after year all hours of the night. Selfish those t.t’s are. Dog in	 86.23369470727992
the manger. Only one lump of sugar in my tea, if you please.	 59.16414981292836
He stood at Fleet street crossing. Luncheon interval. A sixpenny at	 28.852654086528325
Rowe’s? Must look up that ad in the national library. An eightpenny in	 49.87435932441467
the Burton. Better. On my way.	 114.5096598486461
He walked on past Bolton’s Westmoreland house. Tea. Tea. Tea. I forgot	 78.96167148119834
to tap Tom Kernan.	 176.6449367493677
Sss. Dth, dth, dth! Three days imagine groaning on a bed with a	 46.6492486014432
vinegared handkerchief round her forehead, her belly swollen out. Phew!	 90.73671454007349
Dreadful simply! Child’s head too big: forceps. Doubled up inside her	 126.48632882460599
trying to butt its way out blindly, groping for the way out. Kill me	 57.93988178417071
that would. Lucky Molly got over hers lightly. They ought to invent	 139.36310491571018
something to stop that. Life with hard labour. Twilight sleep idea:	 157.7238250135909
queen Victoria was given that. Nine she had. A good layer. Old woman	 70.98507196033907
that lived in a shoe she had so many children. Suppose he was	 48.1957051341272
consumptive. Time someone thought about it instead of gassing about the	 42.30361626780806
what was it the pensive bosom of the silver effulgence. Flapdoodle to	 25.065046163133857
feed fools on. They could easily have big establishments whole thing	 179.2856059412463
quite painless out of all the taxes give every child born five quid at	 67.64807772538995
compound interest up to twentyone five per cent is a hundred shillings	 61.89563994294065
and five tiresome pounds multiply by twenty decimal system encourage	 139.0216540389416
people to put by money save hundred and ten and a bit twentyone years	 232.92119412853037
want to work it out on paper come to a tidy sum more than you think.	 43.53661767647499
Not stillborn of course. They are not even registered. Trouble for	 35.52971343852751
nothing.	 1607.3341761142708
Funny sight two of them together, their bellies out. Molly and Mrs	 164.06260179300753
Moisel. Mothers’ meeting. Phthisis retires for the time being, then	 37.504007955361516
returns. How flat they look all of a sudden after. Peaceful eyes.	 183.0862753642777
Weight off their mind. Old Mrs Thornton was a jolly old soul. All my	 148.76104572255838
babies, she said. The spoon of pap in her mouth before she fed them. O,	 56.841705298342994
that’s nyumnyum. Got her hand crushed by old Tom Wall’s son. His first	 189.83484212390493
bow to the public. Head like a prize pumpkin. Snuffy Dr Murren. People	 105.25494460245137
knocking them up at all hours. For God’ sake, doctor. Wife in her	 101.13709040837767
throes. Then keep them waiting months for their fee. To attendance on	 105.04304586027001
your wife. No gratitude in people. Humane doctors, most of them.	 166.05371939530434
Before the huge high door of the Irish house of parliament a flock of	 70.6360805196929
pigeons flew. Their little frolic after meals. Who will we do it on? I	 82.35348675614165
pick the fellow in black. Here goes. Here’s good luck. Must be	 255.28566079228779
thrilling from the air. Apjohn, myself and Owen Goldberg up in the	 32.26109027418465
trees near Goose green playing the monkeys. Mackerel they called me.	 127.01401596954382
A squad of constables debouched from College street, marching in Indian	 18.150326245099453
file. Goosestep. Foodheated faces, sweating helmets, patting their	 46.17299969048846
truncheons. After their feed with a good load of fat soup under their	 32.79986791241107
belts. Policeman’s lot is oft a happy one. They split up in groups and	 56.238013974241845
scattered, saluting, towards their beats. Let out to graze. Best moment	 157.99641239791703
to attack one in pudding time. A punch in his dinner. A squad of	 63.11790794849275
others, marching irregularly, rounded Trinity railings making for the	 90.36436477875932
station. Bound for their troughs. Prepare to receive cavalry. Prepare	 38.09538875007254
to receive soup.	 169.21720761290953
He crossed under Tommy Moore’s roguish finger. They did right to put	 153.49648422443295
him up over a urinal: meeting of the waters. Ought to be places for	 66.40341908985508
women. Running into cakeshops. Settle my hat straight. _There is not in	 137.90496373314778
this wide world a vallee_. Great song of Julia Morkan’s. Kept her voice	 100.15120338698692
up to the very last. Pupil of Michael Balfe’s, wasn’t she?	 77.96279674523623
He gazed after the last broad tunic. Nasty customers to tackle. Jack	 42.38474497224662
Power could a tale unfold: father a G man. If a fellow gave them	 137.86214754882928
trouble being lagged they let him have it hot and heavy in the	 101.52366580327993
bridewell. Can’t blame them after all with the job they have especially	 54.13459705653141
the young hornies. That horsepoliceman the day Joe Chamberlain was	 52.58065631655377
given his degree in Trinity he got a run for his money. My word he did!	 113.85725659646664
His horse’s hoofs clattering after us down Abbey street. Lucky I had	 79.33703861234096
the presence of mind to dive into Manning’s or I was souped. He did	 48.931008026321514
come a wallop, by George. Must have cracked his skull on the	 64.02372357601163
cobblestones. I oughtn’t to have got myself swept along with those	 71.64310332569895
medicals. And the Trinity jibs in their mortarboards. Looking for	 40.29173810324613
trouble. Still I got to know that young Dixon who dressed that sting	 82.00209964015936
for me in the Mater and now he’s in Holles street where Mrs Purefoy.	 47.26724329386784
Wheels within wheels. Police whistle in my ears still. All skedaddled.	 250.45808238989625
Why he fixed on me. Give me in charge. Right here it began.	 130.48117809894728
—Up the Boers!	 32.3421265221091
—Three cheers for De Wet!	 69.19218659403784
—We’ll hang Joe Chamberlain on a sourapple tree.	 79.30971436050123
Silly billies: mob of young cubs yelling their guts out. Vinegar hill.	 187.77665209040822
The Butter exchange band. Few years’ time half of them magistrates and	 66.39019705582147
civil servants. War comes on: into the army helterskelter: same fellows	 238.49104037948615
used to. Whether on the scaffold high.	 68.37833487940345
Never know who you’re talking to. Corny Kelleher he has Harvey Duff in	 48.31999667466385
his eye. Like that Peter or Denis or James Carey that blew the gaff on	 105.3624228386031
the invincibles. Member of the corporation too. Egging raw youths on to	 46.73207539603782
get in the know all the time drawing secret service pay from the	 102.35387712124452
castle. Drop him like a hot potato. Why those plainclothes men are	 175.44802498931062
always courting slaveys. Easily twig a man used to uniform.	 88.43988169238538
Squarepushing up against a backdoor. Maul her a bit. Then the next	 51.694352265221355
thing on the menu. And who is the gentleman does be visiting there? Was	 46.36701604849393
the young master saying anything? Peeping Tom through the keyhole.	 99.55795317393532
Decoy duck. Hotblooded young student fooling round her fat arms	 75.82818354363064
ironing.	 4.608171674364364
—Are those yours, Mary?	 213.75831277532086
—I don’t wear such things... Stop or I’ll tell the missus on you. Out	 110.63157671906036
half the night.	 351.7393626875636
—There are great times coming, Mary. Wait till you see.	 95.15987328648659
—Ah, gelong with your great times coming.	 120.9982858634819
Barmaids too. Tobaccoshopgirls.	 22.39375933738574
James Stephens’ idea was the best. He knew them. Circles of ten so that	 162.55110595820932
a fellow couldn’t round on more than his own ring. Sinn Fein. Back out	 107.38035800087292
you get the knife. Hidden hand. Stay in. The firing squad. Turnkey’s	 34.9404613603119
daughter got him out of Richmond, off from Lusk. Putting up in the	 81.53467779020471
Buckingham Palace hotel under their very noses. Garibaldi.	 72.38261878955409
You must have a certain fascination: Parnell. Arthur Griffith is a	 38.456933206056036
squareheaded fellow but he has no go in him for the mob. Or gas about	 103.81086969635297
our lovely land. Gammon and spinach. Dublin Bakery Company’s tearoom.	 22.20380781174508
Debating societies. That republicanism is the best form of government.	 33.5604745407888
That the language question should take precedence of the economic	 49.695774774155176
question. Have your daughters inveigling them to your house. Stuff them	 224.43898395790265
up with meat and drink. Michaelmas goose. Here’s a good lump of thyme	 93.02049102212598
seasoning under the apron for you. Have another quart of goosegrease	 21.007824213980616
before it gets too cold. Halffed enthusiasts. Penny roll and a walk	 98.67250880818727
with the band. No grace for the carver. The thought that the other chap	 54.123902166112316
pays best sauce in the world. Make themselves thoroughly at home. Show	 142.48256074200063
us over those apricots, meaning peaches. The not far distant day.	 146.80038260533817
Homerule sun rising up in the northwest.	 13.403548447797178
His smile faded as he walked, a heavy cloud hiding the sun slowly,	 59.11922542413409
shadowing Trinity’s surly front. Trams passed one another, ingoing,	 54.05000020697814
outgoing, clanging. Useless words. Things go on same, day after day:	 130.40860346204238
squads of police marching out, back: trams in, out. Those two loonies	 79.83930762896517
mooching about. Dignam carted off. Mina Purefoy swollen belly on a bed	 135.75078805316943
groaning to have a child tugged out of her. One born every second	 47.42706300980276
somewhere. Other dying every second. Since I fed the birds five	 219.72176545005897
minutes. Three hundred kicked the bucket. Other three hundred born,	 125.67497883421827
washing the blood off, all are washed in the blood of the lamb, bawling	 84.55795902908936
maaaaaa.	 4.608171674364364
Cityful passing away, other cityful coming, passing away too: other	 190.71783656459786
coming on, passing on. Houses, lines of houses, streets, miles of	 211.95840436002763
pavements, piledup bricks, stones. Changing hands. This owner, that.	 80.3607239098282
Landlord never dies they say. Other steps into his shoes when he gets	 124.22490164937943
his notice to quit. They buy the place up with gold and still they have	 83.09873075859856
all the gold. Swindle in it somewhere. Piled up in cities, worn away	 94.17304437166644
age after age. Pyramids in sand. Built on bread and onions. Slaves	 92.83780102110047
Chinese wall. Babylon. Big stones left. Round towers. Rest rubble,	 397.64074137993833
sprawling suburbs, jerrybuilt. Kerwan’s mushroom houses built of	 15.450160412858752
breeze. Shelter, for the night.	 61.63054512495361
No-one is anything.	 851.49778701928
This is the very worst hour of the day. Vitality. Dull, gloomy: hate	 75.77088749043688
this hour. Feel as if I had been eaten and spewed.	 37.833785969469346
Provost’s house. The reverend Dr Salmon: tinned salmon. Well tinned in	 24.864964089687405
there. Like a mortuary chapel. Wouldn’t live in it if they paid me.	 72.84781165313649
Hope they have liver and bacon today. Nature abhors a vacuum.	 94.54912437021834
The sun freed itself slowly and lit glints of light among the	 78.66560832833002
silverware opposite in Walter Sexton’s window by which John Howard	 137.67527563817453
Parnell passed, unseeing.	 244.9985165706099
There he is: the brother. Image of him. Haunting face. Now that’s a	 55.44827139881386
coincidence. Course hundreds of times you think of a person and don’t	 116.94365019843525
meet him. Like a man walking in his sleep. No-one knows him. Must be a	 42.032944866833624
corporation meeting today. They say he never put on the city marshal’s	 42.44744566160407
uniform since he got the job. Charley Kavanagh used to come out on his	 74.2248898516927
high horse, cocked hat, puffed, powdered and shaved. Look at the	 48.593781786263875
woebegone walk of him. Eaten a bad egg. Poached eyes on ghost. I have a	 60.931176772210065
pain. Great man’s brother: his brother’s brother. He’d look nice on the	 122.94876560524204
city charger. Drop into the D.B.C. probably for his coffee, play chess	 70.22019400680405
there. His brother used men as pawns. Let them all go to pot. Afraid to	 210.2836270020968
pass a remark on him. Freeze them up with that eye of his. That’s the	 99.33962616564679
fascination: the name. All a bit touched. Mad Fanny and his other	 85.59418153049438
sister Mrs Dickinson driving about with scarlet harness. Bolt upright	 182.43402804568453
like surgeon M’Ardle. Still David Sheehy beat him for south Meath.	 53.9529089222489
Apply for the Chiltern Hundreds and retire into public life. The	 26.007770983355677
patriot’s banquet. Eating orangepeels in the park. Simon Dedalus said	 23.109841830207703
when they put him in parliament that Parnell would come back from the	 62.49543719462707
grave and lead him out of the house of commons by the arm.	 45.0278340194281
—Of the twoheaded octopus, one of whose heads is the head upon which	 45.87902666767449
the ends of the world have forgotten to come while the other speaks	 47.256806864447945
with a Scotch accent. The tentacles...	 20.701637299402083
They passed from behind Mr Bloom along the curbstone. Beard and	 83.39237856222302
bicycle. Young woman.	 410.47690315901855
And there he is too. Now that’s really a coincidence: second time.	 110.39178474958717
Coming events cast their shadows before. With the approval of the	 80.29810913932181
eminent poet, Mr Geo. Russell. That might be Lizzie Twigg with him. A.	 65.05216043682982
E.: what does that mean? Initials perhaps. Albert Edward, Arthur	 161.38085769202135
Edmund, Alphonsus Eb Ed El Esquire. What was he saying? The ends of the	 28.0344002803772
world with a Scotch accent. Tentacles: octopus. Something occult:	 33.14777090200969
symbolism. Holding forth. She’s taking it all in. Not saying a word. To	 122.56594301477705
aid gentleman in literary work.	 122.95484780013807
His eyes followed the high figure in homespun, beard and bicycle, a	 50.07022284519123
listening woman at his side. Coming from the vegetarian. Only	 75.54228109302655
weggebobbles and fruit. Don’t eat a beefsteak. If you do the eyes of	 54.21336938709594
that cow will pursue you through all eternity. They say it’s healthier.	 97.37378260453896
Windandwatery though. Tried it. Keep you on the run all day. Bad as a	 80.87192151974703
bloater. Dreams all night. Why do they call that thing they gave me	 69.44243880678819
nutsteak? Nutarians. Fruitarians. To give you the idea you are eating	 39.73200528646933
rumpsteak. Absurd. Salty too. They cook in soda. Keep you sitting by	 74.04129631525626
the tap all night.	 313.13648980744154
Her stockings are loose over her ankles. I detest that: so tasteless.	 54.19911043732324
Those literary etherial people they are all. Dreamy, cloudy,	 70.89686203004297
symbolistic. Esthetes they are. I wouldn’t be surprised if it was that	 37.08748081566169
kind of food you see produces the like waves of the brain the poetical.	 92.00480806036721
For example one of those policemen sweating Irish stew into their	 51.551134797890576
shirts you couldn’t squeeze a line of poetry out of him. Don’t know	 72.60030513049868
what poetry is even. Must be in a certain mood.	 58.293347549005205
The dreamy cloudy gull	 28.481400457750713
Waves o’er the waters dull.	 82.59267866811795
He crossed at Nassau street corner and stood before the window of	 55.4853827650925
Yeates and Son, pricing the fieldglasses. Or will I drop into old	 73.75868298832918
Harris’s and have a chat with young Sinclair? Wellmannered fellow.	 43.022933357354084
Probably at his lunch. Must get those old glasses of mine set right.	 174.07135832971426
Goerz lenses six guineas. Germans making their way everywhere. Sell on	 73.00931611329449
easy terms to capture trade. Undercutting. Might chance on a pair in	 92.44898355684849
the railway lost property office. Astonishing the things people leave	 67.90328158797429
behind them in trains and cloakrooms. What do they be thinking about?	 42.42590871073108
Women too. Incredible. Last year travelling to Ennis had to pick up	 52.35915189494844
that farmer’s daughter’s bag and hand it to her at Limerick junction.	 110.85416160997865
Unclaimed money too. There’s a little watch up there on the roof of the	 46.6319326463168
bank to test those glasses by.	 193.45292281619194
His lids came down on the lower rims of his irides. Can’t see it. If	 38.690046489172154
you imagine it’s there you can almost see it. Can’t see it.	 36.96662837187342
He faced about and, standing between the awnings, held out his right	 53.22401029292729
hand at arm’s length towards the sun. Wanted to try that often. Yes:	 110.78066546894767
completely. The tip of his little finger blotted out the sun’s disk.	 22.011742751464322
Must be the focus where the rays cross. If I had black glasses.	 77.40102201861272
Interesting. There was a lot of talk about those sunspots when we were	 40.4055069168104
in Lombard street west. Looking up from the back garden. Terrific	 29.932519991552883
explosions they are. There will be a total eclipse this year: autumn	 39.29982562631734
some time.	 201.5270231773873
Now that I come to think of it that ball falls at Greenwich time. It’s	 91.7237688989997
the clock is worked by an electric wire from Dunsink. Must go out there	 74.82429642706457
some first Saturday of the month. If I could get an introduction to	 40.687492924922985
professor Joly or learn up something about his family. That would do	 127.62240611291625
to: man always feels complimented. Flattery where least expected.	 88.85938437248845
Nobleman proud to be descended from some king’s mistress. His	 104.14764986510907
foremother. Lay it on with a trowel. Cap in hand goes through the land.	 57.19023841188552
Not go in and blurt out what you know you’re not to: what’s parallax?	 74.38978611227165
Show this gentleman the door.	 208.26841748707352
Ah.	 892.5304701208863
His hand fell to his side again.	 47.105467486914414
Never know anything about it. Waste of time. Gasballs spinning about,	 54.3812089922541
crossing each other, passing. Same old dingdong always. Gas: then	 197.89117538164615
solid: then world: then cold: then dead shell drifting around, frozen	 114.48574549612934
rock, like that pineapple rock. The moon. Must be a new moon out, she	 50.055719375081345
said. I believe there is.	 84.99998143189539
He went on by la maison Claire.	 30.67789070337704
Wait. The full moon was the night we were Sunday fortnight exactly	 74.93558040198022
there is a new moon. Walking down by the Tolka. Not bad for a Fairview	 32.80363911116352
moon. She was humming. The young May moon she’s beaming, love. He other	 210.043190815494
side of her. Elbow, arm. He. Glowworm’s la-amp is gleaming, love.	 59.87357002557002
Touch. Fingers. Asking. Answer. Yes.	 690.8128566752306
Stop. Stop. If it was it was. Must.	 69.28141349560663
Mr Bloom, quickbreathing, slowlier walking passed Adam court.	 71.21462525148893
With a keep quiet relief his eyes took note this is the street here	 85.1089507024782
middle of the day of Bob Doran’s bottle shoulders. On his annual bend,	 90.61158712401847
M’Coy said. They drink in order to say or do something or _cherchez la	 118.35570207693218
femme_. Up in the Coombe with chummies and streetwalkers and then the	 24.562766608871463
rest of the year sober as a judge.	 178.26179718835925
Yes. Thought so. Sloping into the Empire. Gone. Plain soda would do him	 148.65084577562195
good. Where Pat Kinsella had his Harp theatre before Whitbred ran the	 217.4076030828213
Queen’s. Broth of a boy. Dion Boucicault business with his harvestmoon	 53.52786967656755
face in a poky bonnet. Three Purty Maids from School. How time flies,	 47.818696188156096
eh? Showing long red pantaloons under his skirts. Drinkers, drinking,	 113.58826581894138
laughed spluttering, their drink against their breath. More power, Pat.	 209.3105805301478
Coarse red: fun for drunkards: guffaw and smoke. Take off that white	 109.80437612268213
hat. His parboiled eyes. Where is he now? Beggar somewhere. The harp	 74.11198174571989
that once did starve us all.	 125.62173921159508
I was happier then. Or was that I? Or am I now I? Twentyeight I was.	 71.68443300233221
She twentythree. When we left Lombard street west something changed.	 18.0258957514528
Could never like it again after Rudy. Can’t bring back time. Like	 227.26844299729078
holding water in your hand. Would you go back to then? Just beginning	 104.21725007606818
then. Would you? Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty	 36.07048606253286
boy? Wants to sew on buttons for me. I must answer. Write it in the	 47.26359317576632
library.	 7643.670197145237
Grafton street gay with housed awnings lured his senses. Muslin prints,	 25.071676618241657
silkdames and dowagers, jingle of harnesses, hoofthuds lowringing in	 13.646292503205872
the baking causeway. Thick feet that woman has in the white stockings.	 68.37950089366304
Hope the rain mucks them up on her. Countrybred chawbacon. All the beef	 66.86795349268552
to the heels were in. Always gives a woman clumsy feet. Molly looks out	 103.72858300991369
of plumb.	 19.14104210176948
He passed, dallying, the windows of Brown Thomas, silk mercers.	 75.07248584303767
Cascades of ribbons. Flimsy China silks. A tilted urn poured from its	 23.914093593209476
mouth a flood of bloodhued poplin: lustrous blood. The huguenots	 35.452422841614265
brought that here. _La causa è santa!_ Tara tara. Great chorus that.	 63.02060454564116
Taree tara. Must be washed in rainwater. Meyerbeer. Tara: bom bom bom.	 36.09148475348349
Pincushions. I’m a long time threatening to buy one. Sticking them all	 43.76385467060977
over the place. Needles in window curtains.	 54.0147301541513
He bared slightly his left forearm. Scrape: nearly gone. Not today	 146.4197672339
anyhow. Must go back for that lotion. For her birthday perhaps.	 73.4829374449222
Junejulyaugseptember eighth. Nearly three months off. Then she mightn’t	 79.736969667377
like it. Women won’t pick up pins. Say it cuts lo.	 99.53323932544393
Gleaming silks, petticoats on slim brass rails, rays of flat silk	 116.09170474399274
stockings.	 9863.507612591713
Useless to go back. Had to be. Tell me all.	 109.83003140852483
High voices. Sunwarm silk. Jingling harnesses. All for a woman, home	 92.65167859731278
and houses, silkwebs, silver, rich fruits spicy from Jaffa. Agendath	 120.90205692426082
Netaim. Wealth of the world.	 85.52627944927043
A warm human plumpness settled down on his brain. His brain yielded.	 90.86736839059851
Perfume of embraces all him assailed. With hungered flesh obscurely, he	 78.19481011464708
mutely craved to adore.	 53.25243253698724
Duke street. Here we are. Must eat. The Burton. Feel better then.	 156.92507453891042
He turned Combridge’s corner, still pursued. Jingling, hoofthuds.	 148.2103891878485
Perfumed bodies, warm, full. All kissed, yielded: in deep summer	 231.51725452334733
fields, tangled pressed grass, in trickling hallways of tenements,	 72.60805096577943
along sofas, creaking beds.	 314.18219019773477
—Jack, love!	 1414.5816068535219
—Darling!	 7480.525040192344
—Kiss me, Reggy!	 291.8923954350222
—My boy!	 684.2552806502272
—Love!	 1289.2335931206333
His heart astir he pushed in the door of the Burton restaurant. Stink	 29.06135674151296
gripped his trembling breath: pungent meatjuice, slush of greens. See	 34.01147362206902
the animals feed.	 167.3789235509063
Men, men, men.	 375.87868784570765
Perched on high stools by the bar, hats shoved back, at the tables	 97.14382224322176
calling for more bread no charge, swilling, wolfing gobfuls of sloppy	 82.6284704959264
food, their eyes bulging, wiping wetted moustaches. A pallid suetfaced	 39.551234044349236
young man polished his tumbler knife fork and spoon with his napkin.	 66.18321201058411
New set of microbes. A man with an infant’s saucestained napkin tucked	 54.12218249766405
round him shovelled gurgling soup down his gullet. A man spitting back	 37.20687494662413
on his plate: halfmasticated gristle: gums: no teeth to chewchewchew	 40.958660887762655
it. Chump chop from the grill. Bolting to get it over. Sad booser’s	 26.29334382958945
eyes. Bitten off more than he can chew. Am I like that? See ourselves	 70.48780147966143
as others see us. Hungry man is an angry man. Working tooth and jaw.	 136.22466480461935
Don’t! O! A bone! That last pagan king of Ireland Cormac in the	 150.55027715931877
schoolpoem choked himself at Sletty southward of the Boyne. Wonder what	 59.97882844712046
he was eating. Something galoptious. Saint Patrick converted him to	 52.26465536300274
Christianity. Couldn’t swallow it all however.	 99.37779102210565
—Roast beef and cabbage.	 474.6629981104384
—One stew.	 83.20206568596824
Smells of men. Spat-on sawdust, sweetish warmish cigarettesmoke, reek	 41.15319766524551
of plug, spilt beer, men’s beery piss, the stale of ferment.	 29.90498420193323
His gorge rose.	 101.86149815167455
Couldn’t eat a morsel here. Fellow sharpening knife and fork to eat all	 90.41772287136105
before him, old chap picking his tootles. Slight spasm, full, chewing	 144.80975517329026
the cud. Before and after. Grace after meals. Look on this picture then	 83.79342365227228
on that. Scoffing up stewgravy with sopping sippets of bread. Lick it	 50.3197853622395
off the plate, man! Get out of this.	 91.20622636587579
He gazed round the stooled and tabled eaters, tightening the wings of	 15.701933866193997
his nose.	 99.6309469609614
—Two stouts here.	 130.30059971712993
—One corned and cabbage.	 98.91222642177169
That fellow ramming a knifeful of cabbage down as if his life depended	 73.8816616192998
on it. Good stroke. Give me the fidgets to look. Safer to eat from his	 57.25598176293434
three hands. Tear it limb from limb. Second nature to him. Born with a	 101.26109783994711
silver knife in his mouth. That’s witty, I think. Or no. Silver means	 139.19097917857633
born rich. Born with a knife. But then the allusion is lost.	 84.25943470884476
An illgirt server gathered sticky clattering plates. Rock, the head	 116.37923622207133
bailiff, standing at the bar blew the foamy crown from his tankard.	 55.758059547719824
Well up: it splashed yellow near his boot. A diner, knife and fork	 153.9490108056392
upright, elbows on table, ready for a second helping stared towards the	 121.21050026850568
foodlift across his stained square of newspaper. Other chap telling him	 139.93706240921003
something with his mouth full. Sympathetic listener. Table talk. I	 105.79736390369114
munched hum un thu Unchster Bunk un Munchday. Ha? Did you, faith?	 40.94567147510189
Mr Bloom raised two fingers doubtfully to his lips. His eyes said:	 41.89333457923719
—Not here. Don’t see him.	 49.580851167019816
Out. I hate dirty eaters.	 91.923266998861
He backed towards the door. Get a light snack in Davy Byrne’s. Stopgap.	 49.85278641032135
Keep me going. Had a good breakfast.	 100.14559781411937
—Roast and mashed here.	 222.15882878541132
—Pint of stout.	 657.6272284555363
Every fellow for his own, tooth and nail. Gulp. Grub. Gulp. Gobstuff.	 16.008746072683536
He came out into clearer air and turned back towards Grafton street.	 49.22269809768043
Eat or be eaten. Kill! Kill!	 475.271566465763
Suppose that communal kitchen years to come perhaps. All trotting down	 270.26670947465783
with porringers and tommycans to be filled. Devour contents in the	 17.219760688125533
street. John Howard Parnell example the provost of Trinity every	 56.040340497284596
mother’s son don’t talk of your provosts and provost of Trinity women	 54.916215779005455

Ailesbury road, Clyde road, artisans’ dwellings, north Dublin union,	 83.24950862349574
lord mayor in his gingerbread coach, old queen in a bathchair. My	 59.36796598636361
plate’s empty. After you with our incorporated drinkingcup. Like sir	 113.2623461060169
Philip Crampton’s fountain. Rub off the microbes with your	 93.32958414456424
handkerchief. Next chap rubs on a new batch with his. Father O’Flynn	 61.47094396851056
would make hares of them all. Have rows all the same. All for number	 69.21115206342151
one. Children fighting for the scrapings of the pot. Want a souppot as	 49.946920704709974
big as the Phoenix park. Harpooning flitches and hindquarters out of	 32.30709265920972
it. Hate people all round you. City Arms hotel _table d’hôte_ she	 87.52732978109817
called it. Soup, joint and sweet. Never know whose thoughts you’re	 164.85797926994653
chewing. Then who’d wash up all the plates and forks? Might be all	 68.37761213395008
feeding on tabloids that time. Teeth getting worse and worse.	 230.8042925804808
After all there’s a lot in that vegetarian fine flavour of things from	 107.57553131024501
the earth garlic of course it stinks after Italian organgrinders crisp	 88.0063088405611
of onions mushrooms truffles. Pain to the animal too. Pluck and draw	 106.01222866992983
fowl. Wretched brutes there at the cattlemarket waiting for the poleaxe	 37.53896571490048
to split their skulls open. Moo. Poor trembling calves. Meh. Staggering	 56.96852681696398
bob. Bubble and squeak. Butchers’ buckets wobbly lights. Give us that	 98.28911691707955
brisket off the hook. Plup. Rawhead and bloody bones. Flayed glasseyed	 33.194596523108416
sheep hung from their haunches, sheepsnouts bloodypapered snivelling	 64.74999656187238
nosejam on sawdust. Top and lashers going out. Don’t maul them pieces,	 91.70981769684144
young one.	 800.0554010548058
Hot fresh blood they prescribe for decline. Blood always needed.	 137.67779607042456
Insidious. Lick it up smokinghot, thick sugary. Famished ghosts.	 86.65137328938889
Ah, I’m hungry.	 172.63605852284604
He entered Davy Byrne’s. Moral pub. He doesn’t chat. Stands a drink now	 209.51451927698776
and then. But in leapyear once in four. Cashed a cheque for me once.	 98.2897511923313
What will I take now? He drew his watch. Let me see now. Shandygaff?	 55.386793496772135
—Hello, Bloom, Nosey Flynn said from his nook.	 24.733866246188594
—Hello, Flynn.	 204.2571718930016
—How’s things?	 1322.1426023410108
—Tiptop... Let me see. I’ll take a glass of burgundy and... let me see.	 37.90171927550164
Sardines on the shelves. Almost taste them by looking. Sandwich? Ham	 32.84473335454525
and his descendants musterred and bred there. Potted meats. What is	 26.892977797545
home without Plumtree’s potted meat? Incomplete. What a stupid ad!	 82.36227497100015
Under the obituary notices they stuck it. All up a plumtree. Dignam’s	 62.155130695414684
potted meat. Cannibals would with lemon and rice. White missionary too	 85.67341205734039
salty. Like pickled pork. Expect the chief consumes the parts of	 92.6520603707825
honour. Ought to be tough from exercise. His wives in a row to watch	 74.99004963128603
the effect. _There was a right royal old nigger. Who ate or something	 76.33976331603917
the somethings of the reverend Mr MacTrigger_. With it an abode of	 32.86578435784721
bliss. Lord knows what concoction. Cauls mouldy tripes windpipes faked	 16.596970916203013
and minced up. Puzzle find the meat. Kosher. No meat and milk together.	 102.2799200707915
Hygiene that was what they call now. Yom Kippur fast spring cleaning of	 47.46988091219846
inside. Peace and war depend on some fellow’s digestion. Religions.	 57.83886966896446
Christmas turkeys and geese. Slaughter of innocents. Eat drink and be	 52.18200399749561
merry. Then casual wards full after. Heads bandaged. Cheese digests all	 145.70405475733574
but itself. Mity cheese.	 334.3563848427284
—Have you a cheese sandwich?	 47.06816042986485
—Yes, sir.	 32.67659391838357
Like a few olives too if they had them. Italian I prefer. Good glass of	 66.7537932735605
burgundy take away that. Lubricate. A nice salad, cool as a cucumber,	 110.10696081010427
Tom Kernan can dress. Puts gusto into it. Pure olive oil. Milly served	 179.80719595942864
me that cutlet with a sprig of parsley. Take one Spanish onion. God	 43.49982046288197
made food, the devil the cooks. Devilled crab.	 37.92464821895273
—Wife well?	 369.96424496821044
—Quite well, thanks... A cheese sandwich, then. Gorgonzola, have you?	 80.33501852523452
—Yes, sir.	 32.67659391838357
Nosey Flynn sipped his grog.	 16.30117007060114
—Doing any singing those times?	 274.596074937019
Look at his mouth. Could whistle in his own ear. Flap ears to match.	 67.41068104044196
Music. Knows as much about it as my coachman. Still better tell him.	 155.19746279492762
Does no harm. Free ad.	 217.30836894262723
—She’s engaged for a big tour end of this month. You may have heard	 71.43689721616687
perhaps.	 3260.0337285126466
—No. O, that’s the style. Who’s getting it up?	 71.07940403302581
The curate served.	 84.15054425727186
—How much is that?	 31.717876466687976
—Seven d., sir... Thank you, sir.	 73.54568762406784
Mr Bloom cut his sandwich into slender strips. _Mr MacTrigger_. Easier	 63.23135964256529
than the dreamy creamy stuff. _His five hundred wives. Had the time of	 88.91828457254523
their lives._	 114.68250334922568
—Mustard, sir?	 569.5642081629533
—Thank you.	 42.452717799045026
He studded under each lifted strip yellow blobs. _Their lives_. I have	 98.02775975763741
it. _It grew bigger and bigger and bigger_.	 33.97842169168585
—Getting it up? he said. Well, it’s like a company idea, you see. Part	 107.33000780354392
shares and part profits.	 31.127529366426117
—Ay, now I remember, Nosey Flynn said, putting his hand in his pocket	 29.272604370227203
to scratch his groin. Who is this was telling me? Isn’t Blazes Boylan	 56.78738795881589
mixed up in it?	 183.6090637016407
A warm shock of air heat of mustard hanched on Mr Bloom’s heart. He	 62.723099706834816
raised his eyes and met the stare of a bilious clock. Two. Pub clock	 66.83257301316412
five minutes fast. Time going on. Hands moving. Two. Not yet.	 235.14021576502972
His midriff yearned then upward, sank within him, yearned more longly,	 52.94447858432568
longingly.	 4.608171674364364
Wine.	 3959.9665046056857
He smellsipped the cordial juice and, bidding his throat strongly to	 30.523143256666646
speed it, set his wineglass delicately down.	 40.59720861343857
—Yes, he said. He’s the organiser in point of fact.	 43.18408560571445
No fear: no brains.	 154.65575601737567
Nosey Flynn snuffled and scratched. Flea having a good square meal.	 42.14019591226461
—He had a good slice of luck, Jack Mooney was telling me, over that	 38.53300114102462
boxingmatch Myler Keogh won again that soldier in the Portobello	 42.08932915110006
barracks. By God, he had the little kipper down in the county Carlow he	 31.495986566805346
was telling me...	 44.08074389254593
Hope that dewdrop doesn’t come down into his glass. No, snuffled it up.	 113.78505243063438
—For near a month, man, before it came off. Sucking duck eggs by God	 140.05473707616235
till further orders. Keep him off the boose, see? O, by God, Blazes is	 65.08818272972162
a hairy chap.	 90.58700692339058
Davy Byrne came forward from the hindbar in tuckstitched shirtsleeves,	 25.028043278823485
cleaning his lips with two wipes of his napkin. Herring’s blush. Whose	 30.490135257207122
smile upon each feature plays with such and such replete. Too much fat	 290.50871894776634
on the parsnips.	 10.942745126666038
—And here’s himself and pepper on him, Nosey Flynn said. Can you give	 45.832195178964554
us a good one for the Gold cup?	 64.64777726375202
—I’m off that, Mr Flynn, Davy Byrne answered. I never put anything on a	 63.58301923401208
horse.	 3587.0084130394384
—You’re right there, Nosey Flynn said.	 59.196977453658825
Mr Bloom ate his strips of sandwich, fresh clean bread, with relish of	 55.515894667801874
disgust pungent mustard, the feety savour of green cheese. Sips of his	 31.859742447754996
wine soothed his palate. Not logwood that. Tastes fuller this weather	 61.20610032587361
with the chill off.	 40.64896014074939
Nice quiet bar. Nice piece of wood in that counter. Nicely planed. Like	 105.70137427044412
the way it curves there.	 81.70811721854075
—I wouldn’t do anything at all in that line, Davy Byrne said. It ruined	 54.73933402315324
many a man, the same horses.	 105.20200285763435
Vintners’ sweepstake. Licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits	 53.06718406079444
for consumption on the premises. Heads I win tails you lose.	 47.22530743641146
—True for you, Nosey Flynn said. Unless you’re in the know. There’s no	 48.90764433580146
straight sport going now. Lenehan gets some good ones. He’s giving	 275.5772541845268
Sceptre today. Zinfandel’s the favourite, Lord Howard de Walden’s, won	 127.38078727463834
at Epsom. Morny Cannon is riding him. I could have got seven to one	 83.52819164525786
against Saint Amant a fortnight before.	 150.15452010408475
—That so? Davy Byrne said...	 15.067388859292123
He went towards the window and, taking up the pettycash book, scanned	 29.5341687396524
its pages.	 230.4665711026472
—I could, faith, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. That was a rare bit of	 21.985826157489996
horseflesh. Saint Frusquin was her sire. She won in a thunderstorm,	 37.70751333527891
Rothschild’s filly, with wadding in her ears. Blue jacket and yellow	 34.80050523331002
cap. Bad luck to big Ben Dollard and his John O’Gaunt. He put me off	 105.19673180645187
it. Ay.	 630.7874905056174
He drank resignedly from his tumbler, running his fingers down the	 53.648457022197846
flutes.	 4.608171674364364
—Ay, he said, sighing.	 119.27321604904196
Mr Bloom, champing, standing, looked upon his sigh. Nosey numbskull.	 74.45904774690266
Will I tell him that horse Lenehan? He knows already. Better let him	 95.38224833947304
forget. Go and lose more. Fool and his money. Dewdrop coming down	 215.85946612180243
again. Cold nose he’d have kissing a woman. Still they might like.	 108.63405707899025
Prickly beards they like. Dogs’ cold noses. Old Mrs Riordan with the	 33.06883503086686
rumbling stomach’s Skye terrier in the City Arms hotel. Molly fondling	 10.864279671386155
him in her lap. O, the big doggybowwowsywowsy!	 80.90439903461191
Wine soaked and softened rolled pith of bread mustard a moment mawkish	 48.37835792881427
cheese. Nice wine it is. Taste it better because I’m not thirsty. Bath	 174.78247973294557
of course does that. Just a bite or two. Then about six o’clock I can.	 74.92083855101372
Six. Six. Time will be gone then. She...	 160.7972260300941
Mild fire of wine kindled his veins. I wanted that badly. Felt so off	 212.38606192183892
colour. His eyes unhungrily saw shelves of tins: sardines, gaudy	 49.90622465625306
lobsters’ claws. All the odd things people pick up for food. Out of	 35.78982828611939
shells, periwinkles with a pin, off trees, snails out of the ground the	 48.72257226440607
French eat, out of the sea with bait on a hook. Silly fish learn	 110.81627690490049
nothing in a thousand years. If you didn’t know risky putting anything	 57.008631762167845
into your mouth. Poisonous berries. Johnny Magories. Roundness you	 76.34953687027334
think good. Gaudy colour warns you off. One fellow told another and so	 206.29874385237702
on. Try it on the dog first. Led on by the smell or the look. Tempting	 136.98965314010007
fruit. Ice cones. Cream. Instinct. Orangegroves for instance. Need	 178.4056991040008
artificial irrigation. Bleibtreustrasse. Yes but what about oysters.	 38.90203696102619
Unsightly like a clot of phlegm. Filthy shells. Devil to open them too.	 43.65171754932669
Who found them out? Garbage, sewage they feed on. Fizz and Red bank	 98.04117643345339
oysters. Effect on the sexual. Aphrodis. He was in the Red Bank this	 40.76430602852716
morning. Was he oysters old fish at table perhaps he young flesh in bed	 264.02311922444767
no June has no ar no oysters. But there are people like things high.	 137.17971692255074
Tainted game. Jugged hare. First catch your hare. Chinese eating eggs	 119.44549363481043
fifty years old, blue and green again. Dinner of thirty courses. Each	 105.49976774790524
dish harmless might mix inside. Idea for a poison mystery. That	 298.7233231424893
archduke Leopold was it no yes or was it Otto one of those Habsburgs?	 70.1943587136735
Or who was it used to eat the scruff off his own head? Cheapest lunch	 62.07547752054431
in town. Of course aristocrats, then the others copy to be in the	 55.91483792467855
fashion. Milly too rock oil and flour. Raw pastry I like myself. Half	 105.48862913341762
the catch of oysters they throw back in the sea to keep up the price.	 114.90856987366796
Cheap no-one would buy. Caviare. Do the grand. Hock in green glasses.	 205.618453764212
Swell blowout. Lady this. Powdered bosom pearls. The _élite. Crème de	 100.39648330213517
la crème_. They want special dishes to pretend they’re. Hermit with a	 46.10893175917494
platter of pulse keep down the stings of the flesh. Know me come eat	 64.7536233180889
with me. Royal sturgeon high sheriff, Coffey, the butcher, right to	 216.08914056247954
venisons of the forest from his ex. Send him back the half of a cow.	 51.82960567899417
Spread I saw down in the Master of the Rolls’ kitchen area. Whitehatted	 61.41021804037794
_chef_ like a rabbi. Combustible duck. Curly cabbage _à la duchesse de	 39.74620431478591
Parme_. Just as well to write it on the bill of fare so you can know	 67.60016192183087
what you’ve eaten. Too many drugs spoil the broth. I know it myself.	 61.44599424638588
Dosing it with Edwards’ desiccated soup. Geese stuffed silly for them.	 60.575525848859264
Lobsters boiled alive. Do ptake some ptarmigan. Wouldn’t mind being a	 91.10978744186968
waiter in a swell hotel. Tips, evening dress, halfnaked ladies. May I	 204.85676921623016
tempt you to a little more filleted lemon sole, miss Dubedat? Yes, do	 109.11115613704514
bedad. And she did bedad. Huguenot name I expect that. A miss Dubedat	 74.05328775196276
lived in Killiney, I remember. _Du de la_ is French. Still it’s the	 119.8093027081778
same fish perhaps old Micky Hanlon of Moore street ripped the guts out	 66.44137862659545

name on a cheque think he was painting the landscape with his mouth	 44.51892437467913
twisted. Moooikill A Aitcha Ha ignorant as a kish of brogues, worth	 85.275690900602
fifty thousand pounds.	 42.67255932627186
Stuck on the pane two flies buzzed, stuck.	 64.96540289317257
Glowing wine on his palate lingered swallowed. Crushing in the	 28.627488895463042
winepress grapes of Burgundy. Sun’s heat it is. Seems to a secret touch	 51.02225641404114
telling me memory. Touched his sense moistened remembered. Hidden under	 186.88652355540373
wild ferns on Howth below us bay sleeping: sky. No sound. The sky. The	 153.77238992990468
bay purple by the Lion’s head. Green by Drumleck. Yellowgreen towards	 87.72828701932633
Sutton. Fields of undersea, the lines faint brown in grass, buried	 100.16520215104528
cities. Pillowed on my coat she had her hair, earwigs in the heather	 40.62304075408178
scrub my hand under her nape, you’ll toss me all. O wonder! Coolsoft	 82.62854397507517
with ointments her hand touched me, caressed: her eyes upon me did not	 63.431856346426386
turn away. Ravished over her I lay, full lips full open, kissed her	 171.33033606680488
mouth. Yum. Softly she gave me in my mouth the seedcake warm and	 115.59147881611794
chewed. Mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled sweetsour of her spittle.	 33.88546873477958
Joy: I ate it: joy. Young life, her lips that gave me pouting. Soft	 226.8720508792157
warm sticky gumjelly lips. Flowers her eyes were, take me, willing	 153.77428971896782
eyes. Pebbles fell. She lay still. A goat. No-one. High on Ben Howth	 133.46279694000194
rhododendrons a nannygoat walking surefooted, dropping currants.	 53.42762667729752
Screened under ferns she laughed warmfolded. Wildly I lay on her,	 46.63381642599505
kissed her: eyes, her lips, her stretched neck beating, woman’s breasts	 133.99047796860623
full in her blouse of nun’s veiling, fat nipples upright. Hot I tongued	 56.743086433764276
her. She kissed me. I was kissed. All yielding she tossed my hair.	 112.94706727493514
Kissed, she kissed me.	 194.90204180128228
Me. And me now.	 309.21573562091453
Stuck, the flies buzzed.	 277.4217563819994
His downcast eyes followed the silent veining of the oaken slab.	 18.768625623287434
Beauty: it curves: curves are beauty. Shapely goddesses, Venus, Juno:	 161.88069999307564
curves the world admires. Can see them library museum standing in the	 112.51615789369066
round hall, naked goddesses. Aids to digestion. They don’t care what	 128.3890288915439
man looks. All to see. Never speaking. I mean to say to fellows like	 85.15007746594243
Flynn. Suppose she did Pygmalion and Galatea what would she say first?	 138.43646394451125
Mortal! Put you in your proper place. Quaffing nectar at mess with gods	 129.29734830950065
golden dishes, all ambrosial. Not like a tanner lunch we have, boiled	 74.55461467639176
mutton, carrots and turnips, bottle of Allsop. Nectar imagine it	 56.64809086940826
drinking electricity: gods’ food. Lovely forms of women sculped	 122.6202245214844
Junonian. Immortal lovely. And we stuffing food in one hole and out	 183.1179494258284
behind: food, chyle, blood, dung, earth, food: have to feed it like	 211.86594870398696
stoking an engine. They have no. Never looked. I’ll look today. Keeper	 85.798723248351
won’t see. Bend down let something fall see if she.	 99.60057976429661
Dribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to do	 29.425159320617094
there to do. A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and	 49.000915408673876
walked, to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men	 343.6866249478296
lovers, a youth enjoyed her, to the yard.	 167.2335835029825
When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book:	 44.70219301760973
—What is this he is? Isn’t he in the insurance line?	 66.54981713217096
—He’s out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said. He does canvassing for	 26.305006931392693
the _Freeman._	 189.82179464486492
—I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said. Is he in trouble?	 50.82233727674919
—Trouble? Nosey Flynn said. Not that I heard of. Why?	 74.25359699821603
—I noticed he was in mourning.	 50.312763249781646
—Was he? Nosey Flynn said. So he was, faith. I asked him how was all at	 48.46283942324993
home. You’re right, by God. So he was.	 70.1924244079899
—I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a	 38.032737343176805
gentleman is in trouble that way. It only brings it up fresh in their	 90.22979612428567
minds.	 9274.544984213786
—It’s not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said. I met him the day before	 33.37219395868219
yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan’s	 96.67875903733295
wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home	 94.47550651936444
to his better half. She’s well nourished, I tell you. Plovers on toast.	 81.05339107967355
—And is he doing for the _Freeman?_ Davy Byrne said.	 32.686918860921416
Nosey Flynn pursed his lips.	 28.782374120053806
—He doesn’t buy cream on the ads he picks up. You can make bacon of	 54.8295957149541
that.	 120.02695599596639
—How so? Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book.	 54.01810146040654
Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers. He	 44.62108843822025
winked.	 4.608171674364364
—He’s in the craft, he said.	 30.50644603957718
—Do you tell me so? Davy Byrne said.	 16.66819797980824
—Very much so, Nosey Flynn said. Ancient free and accepted order. He’s	 107.95046045964669
an excellent brother. Light, life and love, by God. They give him a leg	 96.29153102631611
up. I was told that by a—well, I won’t say who.	 80.76700976298228
—Is that a fact?	 39.23368656250443
—O, it’s a fine order, Nosey Flynn said. They stick to you when you’re	 55.2373613611627
down. I know a fellow was trying to get into it. But they’re as close	 85.53901914461915
as damn it. By God they did right to keep the women out of it.	 71.71649001903046
Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one:	 75.68964148704656
—Iiiiiichaaaaaaach!	 4.608171674364364
—There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find	 35.79098006775853
out what they do be doing. But be damned but they smelt her out and	 117.1515123583718
swore her in on the spot a master mason. That was one of the saint	 107.7696052430826
Legers of Doneraile.	 6.750982139479042
Davy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes:	 51.995322720487295
—And is that a fact? Decent quiet man he is. I often saw him in here	 58.31951895733653
and I never once saw him—you know, over the line.	 139.73004754610002
—God Almighty couldn’t make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly. Slips	 39.765144304956486
off when the fun gets too hot. Didn’t you see him look at his watch?	 90.70492785729397
Ah, you weren’t there. If you ask him to have a drink first thing he	 64.90684995754494
does he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe. Declare to	 48.5088102253915
God he does.	 186.0430939098763
—There are some like that, Davy Byrne said. He’s a safe man, I’d say.	 61.24583353424376
—He’s not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up. He’s been known	 40.35998037455997
to put his hand down too to help a fellow. Give the devil his due. O,	 210.65124451287298
Bloom has his good points. But there’s one thing he’ll never do.	 119.30747758289738
His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.	 46.668122948932144
—I know, Davy Byrne said.	 10.526131780646146
—Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.	 50.16410962466588
Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in. Tom Rochford followed frowning,	 65.20169295744219
a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.	 21.70347681380165
—Day, Mr Byrne.	 126.31191463590969
—Day, gentlemen.	 215.94566777523474
They paused at the counter.	 46.799826364320545
—Who’s standing? Paddy Leonard asked.	 47.47080388902031
—I’m sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.	 83.51158021393006
—Well, what’ll it be? Paddy Leonard asked.	 39.7718409055685
—I’ll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.	 32.939093627904256
—How much? Paddy Leonard cried. Since when, for God’ sake? What’s	 53.36270506273034
yours, Tom?	 1511.5550550312746
—How is the main drainage? Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.	 57.20369764736066
For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and	 23.48632843594506
hiccupped.	 4.608171674364364
—Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne? he said.	 57.36674454463523
—Certainly, sir.	 379.46459533720486
Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates.	 33.79208325280577
—Lord love a duck, he said. Look at what I’m standing drinks to! Cold	 134.4766889689397
water and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg.	 89.50661692271024
He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup. A dead snip.	 46.60844910224227
—Zinfandel is it? Nosey Flynn asked.	 22.790785905051354
Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set	 46.87712992723721
before him.	 110.50578264124276
—That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.	 73.27066343073906
—Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.	 18.86204761709185
Tom Rochford nodded and drank.	 48.107057419240206
—Is it Zinfandel?	 47.955930506751095
—Say nothing! Bantam Lyons winked. I’m going to plunge five bob on my	 44.25647897437149
own.	 1451.7731062476998
—Tell us if you’re worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard	 60.57328261900553
said. Who gave it to you?	 80.317832247203
Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.	 83.11922449882148
—So long! Nosey Flynn said.	 13.766356813559538
The others turned.	 111.49845469944162
—That’s the man now that gave it to me, Bantam Lyons whispered.	 69.26532406426875
—Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn. Mr Byrne, sir, we’ll take two	 69.15533473300017
of your small Jamesons after that and a...	 88.6990599356058
—Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.	 38.53487865810347
—Ay, Paddy Leonard said. A suckingbottle for the baby.	 30.265908678860765
Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth	 38.344405605985365
smooth. Something green it would have to be: spinach, say. Then with	 178.57160390031436
those Röntgen rays searchlight you could.	 90.69579081244454
At Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the	 36.29787252774095
cobblestones and lapped it with new zest. Surfeit. Returned with thanks	 60.20826753663247
having fully digested the contents. First sweet then savoury. Mr Bloom	 67.37959458443478
coasted warily. Ruminants. His second course. Their upper jaw they	 128.76228891755105
move. Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of	 56.96196082045413
his? Wasting time explaining it to Flynn’s mouth. Lean people long	 100.62053525629575
mouths. Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and	 93.39206361375619
invent free. Course then you’d have all the cranks pestering.	 58.16407128938475
He hummed, prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars:	 20.407060407178527
Don Giovanni, a cenar teco	 17.51824149739096
M’invitasti.	 4.608171674364364
Feel better. Burgundy. Good pick me up. Who distilled first? Some chap	 156.40669235066485
in the blues. Dutch courage. That _Kilkenny People_ in the national	 16.705066682521885
library now I must.	 141.87599320307186
Bare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller,	 87.27836078162308
plumber, turned back his thoughts. They could: and watch it all the way	 128.7661762356029
down, swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour	 64.78489893208818
round the body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric	 29.374704776551496
juice coils of intestines like pipes. But the poor buffer would have to	 27.13069599374861
stand all the time with his insides entrails on show. Science.	 40.39912570385709
—_A cenar teco._	 9.296616798493048
What does that _teco_ mean? Tonight perhaps.	 120.63220427844523
Don Giovanni, thou hast me invited	 52.429307400769794
To come to supper tonight,	 138.94270325898555
The rum the rumdum.	 192.4365899973272
Doesn’t go properly.	 158.02475138948031
Keyes: two months if I get Nannetti to. That’ll be two pounds ten about	 130.48584001156607
two pounds eight. Three Hynes owes me. Two eleven. Prescott’s dyeworks	 147.18070857135612
van over there. If I get Billy Prescott’s ad: two fifteen. Five guineas	 126.0577988820894
about. On the pig’s back.	 305.69068229849006
Could buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new	 51.641751530330154
garters.	 9465.147824297586
Today. Today. Not think.	 314.444982832387
Tour the south then. What about English wateringplaces? Brighton,	 117.70680069909723
Margate. Piers by moonlight. Her voice floating out. Those lovely	 79.50067266405566
seaside girls. Against John Long’s a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy	 42.40171934190178
thought, gnawing a crusted knuckle. Handy man wants job. Small wages.	 123.48392709726885
Will eat anything.	 261.3200303124513
Mr Bloom turned at Gray’s confectioner’s window of unbought tarts and	 18.883666286372307
passed the reverend Thomas Connellan’s bookstore. _Why I left the	 48.19383304384038
church of Rome? Birds’ Nest._ Women run him. They say they used to give	 85.9546539230716
pauper children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato	 79.40303698863468
blight. Society over the way papa went to for the conversion of poor	 51.456139500745174
jews. Same bait. Why we left the church of Rome.	 83.630138920019
A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane. No	 61.037712034739606
tram in sight. Wants to cross.	 239.2262031262764
—Do you want to cross? Mr Bloom asked.	 25.21442775705311
The blind stripling did not answer. His wallface frowned weakly. He	 64.31819079235612
moved his head uncertainly.	 99.89006764918533
—You’re in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said. Molesworth street is opposite.	 80.58697510532576
Do you want to cross? There’s nothing in the way.	 34.64148106252461
The cane moved out trembling to the left. Mr Bloom’s eye followed its	 61.867398410176044
line and saw again the dyeworks’ van drawn up before Drago’s. Where I	 89.85593299193167
saw his brillantined hair just when I was. Horse drooping. Driver in	 67.68107826920486
John Long’s. Slaking his drouth.	 89.99215653380286
—There’s a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it’s not moving. I’ll see you	 70.79058541445818
across. Do you want to go to Molesworth street?	 78.69038523527657
—Yes, the stripling answered. South Frederick street.	 130.24940704430227
—Come, Mr Bloom said.	 31.79610114827069
He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to	 118.5477102614298
guide it forward.	 143.5303406168946
Say something to him. Better not do the condescending. They mistrust	 82.23889534852105
what you tell them. Pass a common remark.	 161.02676348993816
—The rain kept off.	 143.72524835917707
No answer.	 222.29403937173618
Stains on his coat. Slobbers his food, I suppose. Tastes all different	 58.8154020402995
for him. Have to be spoonfed first. Like a child’s hand, his hand. Like	 50.71257537336554
Milly’s was. Sensitive. Sizing me up I daresay from my hand. Wonder if	 71.1914484689017
he has a name. Van. Keep his cane clear of the horse’s legs: tired	 104.11098058308502
drudge get his doze. That’s right. Clear. Behind a bull: in front of a	 53.04488394652337
horse.	 3587.0084130394384
—Thanks, sir.	 680.6348755213994
Knows I’m a man. Voice.	 145.8446079034408
—Right now? First turn to the left.	 173.88192637030505
The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing	 28.408491782818178
his cane back, feeling again.	 83.76680735824674
Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone	 26.937208536175095
tweed. Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there?	 104.8534207431699
Must have felt it. See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense	 106.50324889548928
of volume. Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark.	 76.61768652570647
Wonder would he feel it if something was removed. Feel a gap. Queer	 172.01531005137224
idea of Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones. Could	 80.09501733886398
he walk in a beeline if he hadn’t that cane? Bloodless pious face like	 118.42665858918002
a fellow going in to be a priest.	 108.40040719794922
Penrose! That was that chap’s name.	 33.54309933090944
Look at all the things they can learn to do. Read with their fingers.	 64.93677483368069
Tune pianos. Or we are surprised they have any brains. Why we think a	 102.03792672973987
deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might	 108.70235417689358
say. Of course the other senses are more. Embroider. Plait baskets.	 43.7924053356165
People ought to help. Workbasket I could buy for Molly’s birthday.	 85.68802460281826
Hates sewing. Might take an objection. Dark men they call them.	 47.352381209674654
Sense of smell must be stronger too. Smells on all sides, bunched	 59.331267177032906
together. Each street different smell. Each person too. Then the	 178.2998164977136
spring, the summer: smells. Tastes? They say you can’t taste wines with	 64.93092176358432
your eyes shut or a cold in the head. Also smoke in the dark they say	 66.06362311435063
get no pleasure.	 738.9948279041698
And with a woman, for instance. More shameless not seeing. That girl	 74.08947325584252
passing the Stewart institution, head in the air. Look at me. I have	 42.04926768794339
them all on. Must be strange not to see her. Kind of a form in his	 77.57638786255592
mind’s eye. The voice, temperatures: when he touches her with his	 45.93642451858197
fingers must almost see the lines, the curves. His hands on her hair,	 122.85878408037009
for instance. Say it was black, for instance. Good. We call it black.	 65.87844912423606
Then passing over her white skin. Different feel perhaps. Feeling of	 277.85987797849805
white.	 1992.019476022999
Postoffice. Must answer. Fag today. Send her a postal order two	 221.79149974788862
shillings, half a crown. Accept my little present. Stationer’s just	 189.93792516056737
here too. Wait. Think over it.	 289.2138264158347
With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above	 133.75060706273126
his ears. Again. Fibres of fine fine straw. Then gently his finger felt	 246.61619835392918
the skin of his right cheek. Downy hair there too. Not smooth enough.	 93.69430205779238
The belly is the smoothest. No-one about. There he goes into Frederick	 70.59344000287545
street. Perhaps to Levenston’s dancing academy piano. Might be settling	 100.58496025748683
my braces.	 47.91192705795907
Walking by Doran’s publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat	 56.59791155969711
and trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of	 75.07691078574908
his belly. But I know it’s whitey yellow. Want to try in the dark to	 89.65241651666338
see.	 746.5896794446304
He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.	 52.303144679625646
Poor fellow! Quite a boy. Terrible. Really terrible. What dreams would	 163.89519748145352
he have, not seeing? Life a dream for him. Where is the justice being	 121.15189239111575
born that way? All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned	 119.25517875115086
and drowned in New York. Holocaust. Karma they call that transmigration	 32.89942210233203
for sins you did in a past life the reincarnation met him pike hoses.	 63.481491199958086
Dear, dear, dear. Pity, of course: but somehow you can’t cotton on to	 63.42509452093734
them someway.	 65.31773659789465
Sir Frederick Falkiner going into the freemasons’ hall. Solemn as Troy.	 82.43894832702414
After his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace. Old legal cronies cracking a	 99.24481446051007
magnum. Tales of the bench and assizes and annals of the bluecoat	 10.709320270483829
school. I sentenced him to ten years. I suppose he’d turn up his nose	 84.17821434824806
at that stuff I drank. Vintage wine for them, the year marked on a	 91.87606937610816
dusty bottle. Has his own ideas of justice in the recorder’s court.	 115.34705424645118
Wellmeaning old man. Police chargesheets crammed with cases get their	 80.748074691144
percentage manufacturing crime. Sends them to the rightabout. The devil	 18.324902235778175
on moneylenders. Gave Reuben J a great strawcalling. Now he’s really	 87.73746219947779
what they call a dirty jew. Power those judges have. Crusty old topers	 73.4835632329866
in wigs. Bear with a sore paw. And may the Lord have mercy on your	 71.06613744937654
soul.	 4899.512649922165
Hello, placard. Mirus bazaar. His Excellency the lord lieutenant.	 108.16265225855986
Sixteenth. Today it is. In aid of funds for Mercer’s hospital. _The	 51.607301411964556
Messiah_ was first given for that. Yes. Handel. What about going out	 163.1882044844829
there: Ballsbridge. Drop in on Keyes. No use sticking to him like a	 70.91414735087139
leech. Wear out my welcome. Sure to know someone on the gate.	 130.1251769296033
Mr Bloom came to Kildare street. First I must. Library.	 44.41284938509358
Straw hat in sunlight. Tan shoes. Turnedup trousers. It is. It is.	 43.61651917809836
His heart quopped softly. To the right. Museum. Goddesses. He swerved	 55.40949005794264
to the right.	 43.67119071865825
Is it? Almost certain. Won’t look. Wine in my face. Why did I? Too	 121.68550644728624
heady. Yes, it is. The walk. Not see. Get on.	 121.8956496849121
Making for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes.	 103.66515229760427
Handsome building. Sir Thomas Deane designed. Not following me?	 70.64158073375492
Didn’t see me perhaps. Light in his eyes.	 93.37418858471312
The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs. Quick. Cold	 47.47988752348222
statues: quiet there. Safe in a minute.	 181.6473968229955
No. Didn’t see me. After two. Just at the gate.	 161.80778722573282
My heart!	 108.79903570799173
His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone. Sir	 134.98462552688557
Thomas Deane was the Greek architecture.	 78.8620897490224
Look for something I.	 238.1131012944083
His hasty hand went quick into a pocket, took out, read unfolded	 56.336769823941275
Agendath Netaim. Where did I?	 85.19555877370134
Busy looking.	 129.31784247782176
He thrust back quick Agendath.	 149.61722703889328
Afternoon she said.	 103.79174345061102
I am looking for that. Yes, that. Try all pockets. Handker. _Freeman._	 130.56912835613952
Where did I? Ah, yes. Trousers. Potato. Purse. Where?	 74.05368693722272
Hurry. Walk quietly. Moment more. My heart.	 414.5596534192039
His hand looking for the where did I put found in his hip pocket soap	 46.02730014827723
lotion have to call tepid paper stuck. Ah soap there I yes. Gate.	 417.4728265963108
Safe!	 21153.83854853149
[ 9 ]	 463.94842625767166
Urbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred:	 30.100534751908842
—And we have, have we not, those priceless pages of _Wilhelm Meister_.	 90.60359032184718
A great poet on a great brother poet. A hesitating soul taking arms	 98.49738085190232
against a sea of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts, as one sees in	 76.9560440530612
real life.	 1099.1619846664641
He came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and a step	 63.61506085729651
backward a sinkapace on the solemn floor.	 89.0363413549471
A noiseless attendant setting open the door but slightly made him a	 86.54157708555634
noiseless beck.	 223.65534890605832
—Directly, said he, creaking to go, albeit lingering. The beautiful	 92.04314838164674
ineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts. One always	 104.15599666015704
feels that Goethe’s judgments are so true. True in the larger analysis.	 60.13272218737824
Twicreakingly analysis he corantoed off. Bald, most zealous by the door	 30.12073576773756
he gave his large ear all to the attendant’s words: heard them: and was	 89.08988725924088
gone.	 3074.575063198837
Two left.	 335.3758620480839
—Monsieur de la Palice, Stephen sneered, was alive fifteen minutes	 140.30997921816066
before his death.	 232.69896856228456
—Have you found those six brave medicals, John Eglinton asked with	 52.41054711595192
elder’s gall, to write _Paradise Lost_ at your dictation? _The Sorrows	 40.824092549719126
of Satan_ he calls it.	 51.784985655518696
Smile. Smile Cranly’s smile.	 666.4710934220889
First he tickled her	 205.92586067653892
Then he patted her	 35.51975517755831
Then he passed the female catheter	 61.516104278980315
For he was a medical	 70.4915544848587
Jolly old medi...	 102.36007844819564
—I feel you would need one more for _Hamlet._ Seven is dear to the	 136.22040550855533
mystic mind. The shining seven W.B. calls them.	 176.95683304390516
Glittereyed his rufous skull close to his greencapped desklamp sought	 46.20058568115829
the face bearded amid darkgreener shadow, an ollav, holyeyed. He	 51.66981200634688
laughed low: a sizar’s laugh of Trinity: unanswered.	 111.13474300267072

Cranly’s eleven true Wicklowmen to free their sireland. Gaptoothed	 76.0928837927877
Kathleen, her four beautiful green fields, the stranger in her house.	 138.5443394065561
And one more to hail him: _ave, rabbi_: the Tinahely twelve. In the	 54.22080371355008
shadow of the glen he cooees for them. My soul’s youth I gave him,	 40.315394635336375

Mulligan has my telegram.	 305.9515013873
Folly. Persist.	 4.411654744205047
—Our young Irish bards, John Eglinton censured, have yet to create a	 68.51096456363011
figure which the world will set beside Saxon Shakespeare’s Hamlet	 237.43548716882432
though I admire him, as old Ben did, on this side idolatry.	 145.17852761904084
—All these questions are purely academic, Russell oracled out of his	 55.23073913726789
shadow. I mean, whether Hamlet is Shakespeare or James I or Essex.	 174.72973153560318
Clergymen’s discussions of the historicity of Jesus. Art has to reveal	 33.78165720786597
to us ideas, formless spiritual essences. The supreme question about a	 50.56402276182624
work of art is out of how deep a life does it spring. The painting of	 63.20653461083491
Gustave Moreau is the painting of ideas. The deepest poetry of Shelley,	 19.13047289962785
the words of Hamlet bring our minds into contact with the eternal	 96.40156626480884
wisdom, Plato’s world of ideas. All the rest is the speculation of	 94.73180001106842
schoolboys for schoolboys.	 349.4364021405487
A. E. has been telling some yankee interviewer. Wall, tarnation strike	 106.05004941117541
me!	 695.4423238734375
—The schoolmen were schoolboys first, Stephen said superpolitely.	 37.64154175506513
Aristotle was once Plato’s schoolboy.	 34.76693240072489
—And has remained so, one should hope, John Eglinton sedately said. One	 129.00939466791837
can see him, a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm.	 44.75429644624872
He laughed again at the now smiling bearded face.	 47.960044669749024
Formless spiritual. Father, Word and Holy Breath. Allfather, the	 130.9468022919869
heavenly man. Hiesos Kristos, magician of the beautiful, the Logos who	 30.41736230533978
suffers in us at every moment. This verily is that. I am the fire upon	 71.81813011679955
the altar. I am the sacrificial butter.	 86.55110234597991
Dunlop, Judge, the noblest Roman of them all, A.E., Arval, the Name	 38.34077122827896
Ineffable, in heaven hight: K.H., their master, whose identity is no	 46.02297385145271
secret to adepts. Brothers of the great white lodge always watching to	 161.09204564721782
see if they can help. The Christ with the bridesister, moisture of	 39.46521324184811
light, born of an ensouled virgin, repentant sophia, departed to the	 39.10843175055218
plane of buddhi. The life esoteric is not for ordinary person. O.P.	 47.11994538271379
must work off bad karma first. Mrs Cooper Oakley once glimpsed our very	 128.3548056684681

naughtn’t when a lady’s ashowing of her elemental.	 34.90545189275993
Mr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light. He bore in his hand with	 50.707848626687905
grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.	 221.94602136119377
—That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet’s musings about	 58.56180191929116
the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and	 13.526819594233077
undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato’s.	 20.275899514452785
John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth:	 27.174793616564575
—Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle	 87.33090108345056
with Plato.	 28.492587109789124
—Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his	 85.5241744047599
commonwealth?	 4.608171674364364
Unsheathe your dagger definitions. Horseness is the whatness of	 12.037621155663237
allhorse. Streams of tendency and eons they worship. God: noise in the	 23.57287245888365
street: very peripatetic. Space: what you damn well have to see.	 112.9776349620213
Through spaces smaller than red globules of man’s blood they	 83.0575483660613
creepycrawl after Blake’s buttocks into eternity of which this	 54.94302302640582
vegetable world is but a shadow. Hold to the now, the here, through	 183.0459250156518
which all future plunges to the past.	 128.0748029692175
Mr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague.	 31.221674889756535
—Haines is gone, he said.	 73.63458916866271
—Is he?	 95.73011993169622
—I was showing him Jubainville’s book. He’s quite enthusiastic, don’t	 111.94519603765865
you know, about Hyde’s _Lovesongs of Connacht._ I couldn’t bring him in	 35.26607527445537
to hear the discussion. He’s gone to Gill’s to buy it.	 33.400680732918985
Bound thee forth, my booklet, quick	 449.8874813506603
To greet the callous public.	 40.603047682426094
Writ, I ween, ’twas not my wish	 298.70460577846234
In lean unlovely English.	 273.2523879998274
—The peatsmoke is going to his head, John Eglinton opined.	 30.771127758775076
We feel in England. Penitent thief. Gone. I smoked his baccy. Green	 72.90532863214895
twinkling stone. An emerald set in the ring of the sea.	 82.48668115256439
—People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the auric egg of	 57.146056235558156
Russell warned occultly. The movements which work revolutions in the	 60.32312492267504
world are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasant’s heart on	 49.15218127899
the hillside. For them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the	 62.20606387661165
living mother. The rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce	 23.573710721129576
the sixshilling novel, the musichall song. France produces the finest	 44.82049949084325
flower of corruption in Mallarmé but the desirable life is revealed	 45.219769344413194
only to the poor of heart, the life of Homer’s Phæacians.	 61.32071153805461
From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.	 91.76568926641765
—Mallarmé, don’t you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose	 29.220749265286436
poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris. The one about	 81.17128171006688
_Hamlet._ He says: _il se promène, lisant au livre de lui-même_, don’t	 33.18629897974101
you know, _reading the book of himself_. He describes _Hamlet_ given in	 125.51714996864808
a French town, don’t you know, a provincial town. They advertised it.	 70.23857529114883
His free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air.	 188.77805498308211
_Hamlet	 4202.658271071198
ou	 4.608171674364364
Le Distrait	 168.8259234502374
Pièce de Shakespeare_	 91.55308809637188
He repeated to John Eglinton’s newgathered frown:	 43.693184382447356
—_Pièce de Shakespeare_, don’t you know. It’s so French. The French	 60.529574625709685
point of view. _Hamlet ou_...	 192.0439075078753
—The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.	 129.99794268130273
John Eglinton laughed.	 28.64476667879655
—Yes, I suppose it would be, he said. Excellent people, no doubt, but	 36.443448297621835
distressingly shortsighted in some matters.	 26.651614116288524
Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.	 18.376074533636586
—A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said. Not	 39.37206845446672
for nothing was he a butcher’s son, wielding the sledded poleaxe and	 40.03423713059625
spitting in his palms. Nine lives are taken off for his father’s one.	 100.97696921553256
Our Father who art in purgatory. Khaki Hamlets don’t hesitate to shoot.	 52.56833908469986
The bloodboltered shambles in act five is a forecast of the	 21.111641647562728
concentration camp sung by Mr Swinburne.	 13.651570192111778
Cranly, I his mute orderly, following battles from afar.	 129.53953370678033
Whelps and dams of murderous foes whom none	 19.05109325405637
But we had spared...	 40.51882723845201
Between the Saxon smile and yankee yawp. The devil and the deep sea.	 58.589812757179985
—He will have it that _Hamlet_ is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said for	 44.50306029383019
Mr Best’s behoof. Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our	 57.92897098917524
flesh creep.	 202.84689749863728
List! List! O List!	 77.84060624815982
My flesh hears him: creeping, hears.	 68.90602234608409
If thou didst ever...	 193.9977042607392
—What is a ghost? Stephen said with tingling energy. One who has faded	 37.96853898984137
into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of	 194.73782469182922
manners. Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris	 97.5564336590013
lies from virgin Dublin. Who is the ghost from _limbo patrum_,	 136.92111501021222
returning to the world that has forgotten him? Who is King Hamlet?	 128.69833202903317
John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.	 32.25622765275399
Lifted.	 7197.24440800643
—It is this hour of a day in mid June, Stephen said, begging with a	 42.06684890772362
swift glance their hearing. The flag is up on the playhouse by the	 85.53946633766982
bankside. The bear Sackerson growls in the pit near it, Paris garden.	 48.43229913881623
Canvasclimbers who sailed with Drake chew their sausages among the	 24.446808488067976
groundlings.	 4.608171674364364
Local colour. Work in all you know. Make them accomplices.	 118.06047290321158
—Shakespeare has left the huguenot’s house in Silver street and walks	 57.992710036793156
by the swanmews along the riverbank. But he does not stay to feed the	 34.956945805659736
pen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes. The swan of Avon	 65.87034112876212
has other thoughts.	 295.7774571714238
Composition of place. Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me!	 61.056386463748915
—The play begins. A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the	 93.2768677419627
castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice. It is	 103.88386581141684
the ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare	 154.98708303819228
who has studied _Hamlet_ all the years of his life which were not	 62.956744418018204
vanity in order to play the part of the spectre. He speaks the words to	 39.09326793569232
Burbage, the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of	 23.067028280594695
cerecloth, calling him by a name:	 80.14618813961162
Hamlet, I am thy father’s spirit,	 21.520359954950838
bidding him list. To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince,	 106.63432335896177
young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has	 73.48936624023617
died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.	 145.4796255563545
Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in	 120.96300992903419
the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words	 70.70951717965984
to his own son’s name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been	 56.30825431355598
prince Hamlet’s twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that	 28.820608896106886
he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises:	 33.266457407383875
you are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is	 65.34443041224858
the guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?	 153.1029479481469
—But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began	 111.92523365472445
impatiently.	 4.608171674364364
Art thou there, truepenny?	 134.0687682930007
—Interesting only to the parish clerk. I mean, we have the plays. I	 89.11638311193504
mean when we read the poetry of _King Lear_ what is it to us how the	 62.466104172866565
poet lived? As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de	 120.33777774360016
l’Isle has said. Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day,	 44.20449748582259
the poet’s drinking, the poet’s debts. We have _King Lear_: and it is	 27.859296514389403
immortal.	 8923.343614258267
Mr Best’s face, appealed to, agreed.	 96.72975305577323
Flow over them with your waves and with your waters,	 189.94887900480782
Mananaan, Mananaan MacLir...	 4.206040932916629
How now, sirrah, that pound he lent you when you were hungry?	 118.39985798723413
Marry, I wanted it.	 274.73675640966246
Take thou this noble.	 444.20676185348606
Go to! You spent most of it in Georgina Johnson’s bed, clergyman’s	 118.81725803292245
daughter. Agenbite of inwit.	 25.130544343757286
Do you intend to pay it back?	 55.12428658272036
O, yes.	 53.80792931955582
When? Now?	 678.5762694809309
Well... No.	 199.08448764255033
When, then?	 572.2931489934449
I paid my way. I paid my way.	 35.70510554213339
Steady on. He’s from beyant Boyne water. The northeast corner. You owe	 95.89696779119092
it.	 190.19379438313373
Wait. Five months. Molecules all change. I am other I now. Other I got	 133.6584471512759
pound.	 4247.982223122267
Buzz. Buzz.	 351.5053755775283
But I, entelechy, form of forms, am I by memory because under	 185.0925905637469
everchanging forms.	 166.36559733285324
I that sinned and prayed and fasted.	 128.75577199436518
A child Conmee saved from pandies.	 98.08651851427443
I, I and I. I.	 223.8221569902541
A.E.I.O.U.	 4.608171674364364
—Do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three centuries?	 25.4775974650294
John Eglinton’s carping voice asked. Her ghost at least has been laid	 119.30617467819918
for ever. She died, for literature at least, before she was born.	 82.45923713274848
—She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born. She	 88.21198625698382
saw him into and out of the world. She took his first embraces. She	 55.99258337142831
bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids	 89.0477372962057
closed when he lay on his deathbed.	 50.33295192955518
Mother’s deathbed. Candle. The sheeted mirror. Who brought me into this	 164.90357664264786
world lies there, bronzelidded, under few cheap flowers. _Liliata	 115.63108750825933
rutilantium._	 4.608171674364364
I wept alone.	 321.87234208642275
John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.	 49.50826743090345
—The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got	 94.47443602502106
out of it as quickly and as best he could.	 96.77385555269282
—Bosh! Stephen said rudely. A man of genius makes no mistakes. His	 46.16934029781588
errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.	 38.04007405834994
Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian,	 40.174106819453236
softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.	 29.93831157881289
—A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of	 25.10636708901444
discovery, one should imagine. What useful discovery did Socrates learn	 62.73749190988539
from Xanthippe?	 66.89635944561256
—Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts	 72.06518167789876
into the world. What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (_absit	 50.41152801027546
nomen!_), Socratididion’s Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever	 44.486700811742175
know. But neither the midwife’s lore nor the caudlelectures saved him	 93.23857323934656
from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.	 15.200666209232557
—But Ann Hathaway? Mr Best’s quiet voice said forgetfully. Yes, we seem	 131.82931060823137
to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.	 83.6591766933247
His look went from brooder’s beard to carper’s skull, to remind, to	 142.080026876384
chide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard,	 22.76503991000889
guiltless though maligned.	 41.18729013113005
—He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory.	 50.450689690773885
He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling	 44.352077445260605
_The girl I left behind me._ If the earthquake did not time it we	 112.97849295685805
should know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of	 149.41734931068714
hounds, the studded bridle and her blue windows. That memory, _Venus	 40.86260971961659
and Adonis_, lay in the bedchamber of every light-of-love in London. Is	 39.06074571995785
Katharine the shrew illfavoured? Hortensio calls her young and	 55.88795823506526
beautiful. Do you think the writer of _Antony and Cleopatra_, a	 27.57768022710226
passionate pilgrim, had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose	 42.671272484740406
the ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to lie withal? Good: he left her	 50.650062372746795
and gained the world of men. But his boywomen are the women of a boy.	 54.22679102197932
Their life, thought, speech are lent them by males. He chose badly? He	 132.2645253664691
was chosen, it seems to me. If others have their will Ann hath a way.	 69.09464804028606
By cock, she was to blame. She put the comether on him, sweet and	 87.45230237277785
twentysix. The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis, stooping	 18.772392434474863
to conquer, as prologue to the swelling act, is a boldfaced Stratford	 59.6420202120501
wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.	 37.57669433942085
And my turn? When?	 109.64021698326032
Come!	 382.81606238906494
—Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly,	 36.85225191675671
brightly.	 20888.175745305787
He murmured then with blond delight for all:	 68.93272380906775
Between the acres of the rye	 9.757267292656675
These pretty countryfolk would lie.	 309.77104331345373
Paris: the wellpleased pleaser.	 46.20657786954941
A tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled its	 58.00253504098841
cooperative watch.	 168.83180883424453
—I am afraid I am due at the _Homestead._	 34.81427851952205
Whither away? Exploitable ground.	 116.31703283971099
—Are you going? John Eglinton’s active eyebrows asked. Shall we see you	 45.65699870069888
at Moore’s tonight? Piper is coming.	 204.47625047629538
—Piper! Mr Best piped. Is Piper back?	 196.64919482618856
Peter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper.	 27.631262995914813
—I don’t know if I can. Thursday. We have our meeting. If I can get	 23.88400837775975
away in time.	 277.54765684491724
Yogibogeybox in Dawson chambers. _Isis Unveiled._ Their Pali book we	 38.15459893324935
tried to pawn. Crosslegged under an umbrel umbershoot he thrones an	 34.07085465657046
Aztec logos, functioning on astral levels, their oversoul, mahamahatma.	 10.118592209409144
The faithful hermetists await the light, ripe for chelaship,	 41.264354256361706
ringroundabout him. Louis H. Victory. T. Caulfield Irwin. Lotus ladies	 41.31133395988936
tend them i’the eyes, their pineal glands aglow. Filled with his god,	 57.60905317243655
he thrones, Buddh under plantain. Gulfer of souls, engulfer. Hesouls,	 19.465976914739173
shesouls, shoals of souls. Engulfed with wailing creecries, whirled,	 11.035418662149548
whirling, they bewail.	 18.22078634113026
In quintessential triviality	 14.2946225236903
For years in this fleshcase a shesoul dwelt.	 31.346867915228696
—They say we are to have a literary surprise, the quaker librarian	 43.97154023498847
said, friendly and earnest. Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering	 166.69805458701936
together a sheaf of our younger poets’ verses. We are all looking	 47.80225591942922
forward anxiously.	 129.9346476239801
Anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces,	 50.377361693509805
lighted, shone.	 941.2657262008945
See this. Remember.	 704.743571978626
Stephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen, hung on his	 34.4631080117315
ashplanthandle over his knee. My casque and sword. Touch lightly with	 64.66168220246453
two index fingers. Aristotle’s experiment. One or two? Necessity is	 47.042168340197314
that in virtue of which it is impossible that one can be otherwise.	 58.85610387867273
Argal, one hat is one hat.	 115.23941809878325
Listen.	 3666.581656814521
Young Colum and Starkey. George Roberts is doing the commercial part.	 77.49203055227638
Longworth will give it a good puff in the _Express._ O, will he? I	 81.72106066893751
liked Colum’s _Drover._ Yes, I think he has that queer thing genius. Do	 56.28041691707798
you think he has genius really? Yeats admired his line: _As in wild	 141.33191337206665
earth a Grecian vase_. Did he? I hope you’ll be able to come tonight.	 39.43369503963005
Malachi Mulligan is coming too. Moore asked him to bring Haines. Did	 106.0693542452186
you hear Miss Mitchell’s joke about Moore and Martyn? That Moore is	 79.05910273835528
Martyn’s wild oats? Awfully clever, isn’t it? They remind one of Don	 164.46328202801038
Quixote and Sancho Panza. Our national epic has yet to be written, Dr	 32.494940525109335
Sigerson says. Moore is the man for it. A knight of the rueful	 34.51989955408746
countenance here in Dublin. With a saffron kilt? O’Neill Russell? O,	 54.236600794090855
yes, he must speak the grand old tongue. And his Dulcinea? James	 124.98245612480139
Stephens is doing some clever sketches. We are becoming important, it	 195.1975147516345
seems.	 3047.473125135645
Cordelia. _Cordoglio._ Lir’s loneliest daughter.	 16.163308261855448
Nookshotten. Now your best French polish.	 66.77703926065722
—Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising. If you will be	 37.92016135383562
so kind as to give the letter to Mr Norman...	 82.6389637718248
—O, yes. If he considers it important it will go in. We have so much	 75.17160419587246
correspondence.	 4.608171674364364
—I understand, Stephen said. Thanks.	 75.34485707634447
God ild you. The pigs’ paper. Bullockbefriending.	 62.32298257795193
Synge has promised me an article for _Dana_ too. Are we going to be	 30.85535967223634
read? I feel we are. The Gaelic league wants something in Irish. I hope	 92.6646094564215
you will come round tonight. Bring Starkey.	 123.6740794379541
Stephen sat down.	 55.38974920096471
The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers. Blushing, his mask	 26.376862430139973
said:	 674.7359038427248
—Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.	 71.92806997419548
He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a	 37.10837378344208
chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low:	 60.316663797037265
—Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?	 61.368219152956385
Alarmed face asks me. Why did he come? Courtesy or an inward light?	 50.53494992552117
—Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been	 27.898718553107493
first a sundering.	 82.03133244448047
—Yes.	 220.63927910459736
Christfox in leather trews, hiding, a runaway in blighted treeforks,	 32.396909002646986
from hue and cry. Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase. Women	 94.03950544824461
he won to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices,	 61.46081947664759
bully tapsters’ wives. Fox and geese. And in New Place a slack	 79.35033375109636
dishonoured body that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as	 138.69512928315606
cinnamon, now her leaves falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow	 49.42355291037502
grave and unforgiven.	 81.95098213734077
—Yes. So you think...	 126.74842656952617
The door closed behind the outgoer.	 18.49203554844195
Rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and	 58.94255587647652
brooding air.	 92.97261758676878
A vestal’s lamp.	 65.1534087415266
Here he ponders things that were not: what Cæsar would have lived to do	 94.24783730525495
had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of	 37.55300925920496
the possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore	 178.58836582894514
when he lived among women.	 180.60676162774274
Coffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words.	 40.577683941676746
Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned. And I heard the voice	 33.56106224692109
of that Egyptian highpriest. _In painted chambers loaded with	 32.0919640229807
tilebooks._	 4.608171674364364
They are still. Once quick in the brains of men. Still: but an itch of	 76.8226992594932
death is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak	 56.79474302698954
their will.	 410.2324135526378
—Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most	 90.06404580588843
enigmatic. We know nothing but that he lived and suffered. Not even so	 56.42686584562494
much. Others abide our question. A shadow hangs over all the rest.	 155.85984647243697
—But _Hamlet_ is so personal, isn’t it? Mr Best pleaded. I mean, a kind	 52.52256919323326
of private paper, don’t you know, of his private life. I mean, I don’t	 79.25397100577169
care a button, don’t you know, who is killed or who is guilty...	 68.89360258117352
He rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk, smiling his	 62.59645922778798
defiance. His private papers in the original. _Ta an bad ar an tir.	 54.22704758720227
Taim in mo shagart_. Put beurla on it, littlejohn.	 52.33614421050444
Quoth littlejohn Eglinton:	 48.11353972971265
—I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but I	 37.621223830156985
may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that	 60.091154710063954
Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.	 64.51168572030656
Bear with me.	 288.4623491360184
Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under	 19.092620389281002
wrinkled brows. A basilisk. _E quando vede l’uomo l’attosca_. Messer	 27.21367995525281
Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.	 34.896795910117596
—As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said,	 80.2741797692499
from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the	 119.8721947460505
artist weave and unweave his image. And as the mole on my right breast	 88.81163513457726
is where it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of	 65.8862487626008
new stuff time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father	 119.61140060664194
the image of the unliving son looks forth. In the intense instant of	 31.84326308712092
imagination, when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which	 96.62225023705678
I was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to	 68.14515491174194
be. So in the future, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit	 83.45998166797106
here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be.	 110.45615457053239
Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.	 38.53892258899179
—Yes, Mr Best said youngly. I feel Hamlet quite young. The bitterness	 74.91830612824081
might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from	 61.99762935933704
the son.	 86.79687478911175
Has the wrong sow by the lug. He is in my father. I am in his son.	 57.70800907482094
—That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.	 81.9220517667915
John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.	 65.41115816363782
—If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a drug	 33.00104360582437
in the market. The plays of Shakespeare’s later years which Renan	 80.35095154510961
admired so much breathe another spirit.	 165.85992722442901
—The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.	 31.893219681735317
—There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a	 53.96832438783173
sundering.	 4.608171674364364
Said that.	 150.49247178546432
—If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over	 41.48996691784159
the hell of time of _King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida,_	 40.163422773257274
look to see when and how the shadow lifts. What softens the heart of a	 104.51821773152922
man, shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles,	 61.5742102668815
prince of Tyre?	 60.671471378275086
Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.	 22.08337509391153
—A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.	 43.40088790951927
—The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant	 17.36238199982954
quantity, John Eglinton detected. The highroads are dreary but they	 25.50422197293025
lead to the town.	 147.40971174319657
Good Bacon: gone musty. Shakespeare Bacon’s wild oats. Cypherjugglers	 95.31804451917202
going the highroads. Seekers on the great quest. What town, good	 73.56447459997257
masters? Mummed in names: A. E., eon: Magee, John Eglinton. East of the	 100.77415498619797
sun, west of the moon: _Tir na n-og_. Booted the twain and staved.	 36.491172713066284
How many miles to Dublin?	 111.22699471205769
Three score and ten, sir.	 160.43691260705432
Will we be there by candlelight?	 69.67718618400396
—Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing	 49.01965432591614
period.	 16648.503073527976
—Does he? What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his	 68.14885507182717
name is, say of it?	 132.82162867166133
—Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita,	 44.304910788622884
that which was lost. What was lost is given back to him: his daughter’s	 90.10843995597311
child. _My dearest wife_, Pericles says, _was like this maid._ Will any	 244.5005353403407
man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother?	 108.76125144894392
—The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur. _L’art d’être	 87.52590109732755
grand_...	 5759.882060320137
—Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added,	 51.21816375968699
another image?	 270.98886718934074
Do you know what you are talking about? Love, yes. Word known to all	 32.054186927325304
men. _Amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quae concupiscimus	 8.732924286071091
—His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of	 31.625038018828636
all experience, material and moral. Such an appeal will touch him. The	 75.72067108879511
images of other males of his blood will repel him. He will see in them	 100.31932700644265
grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself.	 31.38037815452968
The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.	 23.95330588152029
—I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of	 45.71925281658802
the public. And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr	 56.300976921924686
George Bernard Shaw. Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris. His articles	 106.4572320573445
on Shakespeare in the _Saturday Review_ were surely brilliant. Oddly	 118.786393575654
enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of	 67.47661211364601
the sonnets. The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke. I	 35.82175630309595
own that if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more	 101.35060664493221
in harmony with—what shall I say?—our notions of what ought not to have	 71.05636834022782
been.	 1585.694488617479
Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk’s egg,	 58.723261632936016
prize of their fray.	 77.77333355779305
He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords. Dost love, Miriam? Dost	 33.8271131972439
love thy man?	 275.35050983480534
—That may be too, Stephen said. There’s a saying of Goethe’s which Mr	 57.69468814644399
Magee likes to quote. Beware of what you wish for in youth because you	 120.51396271909161
will get it in middle life. Why does he send to one who is a	 67.85801884886078
_buonaroba,_ a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a	 86.9527400077172
scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him? He was himself a lord	 69.74158562958186
of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had	 67.06575378700872
written _Romeo and Juliet_. Why? Belief in himself has been untimely	 64.84620085403574
killed. He was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, I should say)	 53.006065830748064
and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play	 51.053589309196155
victoriously the game of laugh and lie down. Assumed dongiovannism will	 74.77455427675953
not save him. No later undoing will undo the first undoing. The tusk of	 56.45513696114014
the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding. If the shrew	 79.77275608567228
is worsted yet there remains to her woman’s invisible weapon. There is,	 71.02732084779213
I feel in the words, some goad of the flesh driving him into a new	 56.12714253938366
passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening even his own	 129.28510338806845
understanding of himself. A like fate awaits him and the two rages	 89.41236501704591
commingle in a whirlpool.	 8.941467320039383
They list. And in the porches of their ears I pour.	 49.36540184130666
—The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the	 38.603340935885925
porch of a sleeping ear. But those who are done to death in sleep	 94.75213685054007
cannot know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their	 148.10828337636934
souls with that knowledge in the life to come. The poisoning and the	 50.22310505996163
beast with two backs that urged it King Hamlet’s ghost could not know	 144.04542840355867
of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator. That is why the	 141.26241111014403
speech (his lean unlovely English) is always turned elsewhere,	 530.4741866760476
backward. Ravisher and ravished, what he would but would not, go with	 84.88833241259078
him from Lucrece’s bluecircled ivory globes to Imogen’s breast, bare,	 89.61326299538293
with its mole cinquespotted. He goes back, weary of the creation he has	 71.31969888466124
piled up to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore. But,	 66.64909950410215
because loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished	 55.741027650923975
personality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he	 30.153243140783324
has revealed. His beaver is up. He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind	 90.54399265784775
by Elsinore’s rocks or what you will, the sea’s voice, a voice heard	 146.4494662107127
only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son	 48.536382168396294
consubstantial with the father.	 33.650615227433306
—Amen! was responded from the doorway.	 75.276893067163
Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?	 146.62715216774342
_Entr’acte_.	 4.608171674364364
A ribald face, sullen as a dean’s, Buck Mulligan came forward, then	 28.53192784538313
blithe in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles. My telegram.	 58.04239342672279
—You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if I mistake not? he	 60.76716789252862
asked of Stephen.	 309.1431395944993
Primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a	 51.992357409527926
bauble.	 4.608171674364364
They make him welcome. _Was Du verlachst wirst Du noch dienen._	 68.88941017383365
Brood of mockers: Photius, pseudomalachi, Johann Most.	 25.61938583410893
He Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself,	 70.02232310198312
Agenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by His fiends,	 88.35527960881475
stripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on	 24.12017261221908
crosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven	 80.47350914566445
and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His	 65.4202828131413
Own Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and	 67.38721208304143
dead when all the quick shall be dead already.	 86.39238193858374
[Illustration]	 4.608171674364364
He lifts his hands. Veils fall. O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells	 75.91858127086637
aquiring.	 4.608171674364364
—Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said. A most instructive discussion.	 39.2427833157445
Mr Mulligan, I’ll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of	 106.44229872522988
Shakespeare. All sides of life should be represented.	 52.56692668176078
He smiled on all sides equally.	 34.02866448679341
Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled:	 59.1658815182795
—Shakespeare? he said. I seem to know the name.	 58.83962229424507
A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.	 62.23266683210471
—To be sure, he said, remembering brightly. The chap that writes like	 73.04122764469469
Synge.	 4.608171674364364
Mr Best turned to him.	 36.86655803620337
—Haines missed you, he said. Did you meet him? He’ll see you after at	 82.13719377645128
the D. B. C. He’s gone to Gill’s to buy Hyde’s _Lovesongs of Connacht_.	 32.251757076560516
—I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said. Was he here?	 82.15859386665457
—The bard’s fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered, are rather tired	 48.31278116791396
perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising. I hear that an actress	 46.83332458937099
played Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin.	 116.28655512990643
Vining held that the prince was a woman. Has no-one made him out to be	 56.699919880543824
an Irishman? Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues. He	 68.08760119009989
swears (His Highness not His Lordship) by saint Patrick.	 33.48220695348749
—The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde’s, Mr Best said,	 36.63250336571345
lifting his brilliant notebook. That _Portrait of Mr W. H._ where he	 61.45178464949954
proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all	 64.38717126069496
hues.	 4.608171674364364
—For Willie Hughes, is it not? the quaker librarian asked.	 37.824875074848165
Or Hughie Wills? Mr William Himself. W. H.: who am I?	 91.05388214852648
—I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily. Of	 49.436999100535445
course it’s all paradox, don’t you know, Hughes and hews and hues, the	 37.9925709600571
colour, but it’s so typical the way he works it out. It’s the very	 59.052804585248836
essence of Wilde, don’t you know. The light touch.	 35.56369066468271
His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe.	 85.40908072965117
Tame essence of Wilde.	 19.00059505508119
You’re darned witty. Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan	 145.27949727863341
Deasy’s ducats.	 4.411654744205047
How much did I spend? O, a few shillings.	 73.58272568069403
For a plump of pressmen. Humour wet and dry.	 133.66571161886696
Wit. You would give your five wits for youth’s proud livery he pranks	 56.63337633023106
in. Lineaments of gratified desire.	 48.53633896475087
There be many mo. Take her for me. In pairing time. Jove, a cool	 78.36745432214427
ruttime send them. Yea, turtledove her.	 37.28328691263916
Eve. Naked wheatbellied sin. A snake coils her, fang in’s kiss.	 66.61095591382477
—Do you think it is only a paradox? the quaker librarian was asking.	 29.03943996382707
The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.	 42.05226836123796
They talked seriously of mocker’s seriousness.	 22.702646148708435
Buck Mulligan’s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile. Then, his head	 130.8103109193377
wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket. His	 87.19653720486754
mobile lips read, smiling with new delight.	 103.62366344725746
—Telegram! he said. Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull!	 159.45002135999547
He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully:	 28.21164765407144
—_The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the	 34.50493056934183
immense debtorship for a thing done._ Signed: Dedalus. Where did you	 52.92222298069213
launch it from? The kips? No. College Green. Have you drunk the four	 63.95349320804631
quid? The aunt is going to call on your unsubstantial father. Telegram!	 102.65325847418093
Malachi Mulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street. O, you peerless mummer!	 82.21704763887884
O, you priestified Kinchite!	 45.21812051072249
Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a	 53.37804942055678
querulous brogue:	 4.411654744205047
—It’s what I’m telling you, mister honey, it’s queer and sick we were,	 78.98248014550629
Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in. ’Twas murmur we did	 224.85255210193426
for a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I’m thinking, and he limp with	 48.214631513516075
leching. And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery’s	 95.34306644518213
sitting civil waiting for pints apiece.	 89.84681471955622
He wailed:	 17.715973535144567
—And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your	 69.32316408274211
conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the	 56.947924751724905
drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.	 19.87376181745498
Stephen laughed.	 227.29204307722688
Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.	 74.39196343106421
—The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you. He heard	 30.4894389238306
you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule. He’s out in pampooties to	 38.282427014788674
murder you.	 219.038221457243
—Me! Stephen exclaimed. That was your contribution to literature.	 100.02126963033852
Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping	 57.71151605187762
ceiling.	 4.608171674364364
—Murder you! he laughed.	 215.97686814852327
Harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of	 46.17453149700468
lights in rue Saint-André-des-Arts. In words of words for words,	 89.36807554485969
palabras. Oisin with Patrick. Faunman he met in Clamart woods,	 27.24848852319764
brandishing a winebottle. _C’est vendredi saint!_ Murthering Irish. His	 66.6698175912549
image, wandering, he met. I mine. I met a fool i’the forest.	 260.5566734490354
—Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.	 59.25030125638508
—... in which everyone can find his own. So Mr Justice Madden in his	 71.02825959966998
_Diary of Master William Silence_ has found the hunting terms... Yes?	 113.72980904001419
What is it?	 17.251153159601138
—There’s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and	 61.933530592713716
offering a card. From the _Freeman._ He wants to see the files of the	 30.518861910989504
_Kilkenny People_ for last year.	 93.01648841627507
—Certainly, certainly, certainly. Is the gentleman?...	 25.24156143860184
He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked,	 207.77245596861505
asked, creaked, asked:	 458.5007104144637
—Is he?... O, there!	 235.7428598396415
Brisk in a galliard he was off, out. In the daylit corridor he talked	 51.46339869245631
with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most	 129.13154688037386
honest broadbrim.	 248.22175442202897
—This gentleman? _Freeman’s Journal? Kilkenny People?_ To be sure. Good	 46.913444581266866
day, sir. _Kilkenny_... We have certainly...	 57.4209926777035
A patient silhouette waited, listening.	 235.8221637359624
—All the leading provincial... _Northern Whig, Cork Examiner,	 55.79966409977242
Enniscorthy Guardian,_ 1903... Will you please?... Evans, conduct this	 56.22960415140606
gentleman... If you just follow the atten... Or, please allow me...	 45.5554203158599
This way... Please, sir...	 200.94075540797425
Voluble, dutiful, he led the way to all the provincial papers, a bowing	 71.71457270226213
dark figure following his hasty heels.	 261.47392957523044
The door closed.	 30.077678358296076
—The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.	 13.061380342026828
He jumped up and snatched the card.	 27.900625674987666
—What’s his name? Ikey Moses? Bloom.	 166.05322154157247
He rattled on:	 82.98837169173285
—Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more. I found him over in the	 34.01392252680755
museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite. The Greek mouth	 83.62001763273965
that has never been twisted in prayer. Every day we must do homage to	 59.04792044149411
her. _Life of life, thy lips enkindle._	 77.00695455785413
Suddenly he turned to Stephen:	 117.26409294236028
—He knows you. He knows your old fellow. O, I fear me, he is Greeker	 92.85082038377226
than the Greeks. His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove.	 53.444350782681255
Venus Kallipyge. O, the thunder of those loins! _The god pursuing the	 92.84270803852586
maiden hid_.	 243.73473277769304
—We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best’s approval.	 46.34609683064891
We begin to be interested in Mrs S. Till now we had thought of her, if	 102.3339056970301
at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.	 92.9834391329282
—Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty	 28.140216024715144
from Kyrios Menelaus’ brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy	 49.535827359465934
in whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope. Twenty	 67.33848793402909
years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a	 101.3450230394138
salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland. His life was	 49.387574022673945
rich. His art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called	 97.25621933874116
it, is the art of surfeit. Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack,	 52.30009957492492
honeysauces, sugar of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons,	 35.42189662958113
ringocandies. Sir Walter Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a	 52.260201794062326
million francs on his back including a pair of fancy stays. The	 45.18185641767621
gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of	 33.43658496802694
Sheba. Twenty years he dallied there between conjugial love and its	 110.20708285867718
chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures. You know	 46.5728203651735
Manningham’s story of the burgher’s wife who bade Dick Burbage to her	 54.1905617709099
bed after she had seen him in _Richard III_ and how Shakespeare,	 90.52710821290961
overhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the horns	 103.74007000939048
and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the capon’s	 37.16302804368005
blankets: _William the conqueror came before Richard III_. And the gay	 100.4165883807298
lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, lady	 159.09020490957033
Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the	 87.79287121188173
punks of the bankside, a penny a time.	 26.23438891481201
Cours la Reine. _Encore vingt sous. Nous ferons de petites	 15.016823683053012
cochonneries. Minette? Tu veux?_	 4.045570071155129
—The height of fine society. And sir William Davenant of Oxford’s	 51.12458525602318
mother with her cup of canary for any cockcanary.	 87.51008543095223
Buck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed:	 93.19119313243343
—Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock!	 160.12790135390026
—And Harry of six wives’ daughter. And other lady friends from	 136.76136482909945
neighbour seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings. But all those	 124.5988837155811
twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing	 71.60937342954824
behind the diamond panes?	 107.58834946229798
Do and do. Thing done. In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist,	 37.83825766156334
he walks, greyedauburn. An azured harebell like her veins. Lids of	 41.893664708848085
Juno’s eyes, violets. He walks. One life is all. One body. Do. But do.	 130.10392470041066
Afar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.	 76.13554038480154
Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton’s desk sharply.	 20.075580979066583
—Whom do you suspect? he challenged.	 58.967967618156386
—Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets. Once spurned twice	 52.507219730333624
spurned. But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.	 119.41092925508298
Love that dare not speak its name.	 83.55429438010486
—As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a	 144.22192003142607
lord.	 1934.5542720362105
Old wall where sudden lizards flash. At Charenton I watched them.	 117.22631290475827
—It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all	 53.84809133774054
other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for	 92.26860683946681
the stallion. Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he	 54.455479892902574
had a shrew to wife. But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a	 66.54063496019927
bedvow. Two deeds are rank in that ghost’s mind: a broken vow and the	 39.709911137076254
dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband’s	 34.45430017695486
brother. Sweet Ann, I take it, was hot in the blood. Once a wooer,	 90.0632384994115
twice a wooer.	 75.75600408293656
Stephen turned boldly in his chair.	 48.191843999927194
—The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning. If you	 60.47220367029311
deny that in the fifth scene of _Hamlet_ he has branded her with infamy	 87.39244563487362
tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years	 84.62442234816908
between the day she married him and the day she buried him. All those	 73.29242585110859
women saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her	 258.0706563719596
poor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the	 46.98663365104452
first to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her	 112.26720301925297
sons, Susan, her husband too, while Susan’s daughter, Elizabeth, to use	 225.94149177704986
granddaddy’s words, wed her second, having killed her first.	 110.8653963523111
O, yes, mention there is. In the years when he was living richly in	 36.18214585728954
royal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her	 83.08085774451872
father’s shepherd. Explain you then. Explain the swansong too wherein	 107.81641270498673
he has commended her to posterity.	 28.37857580126012
He faced their silence.	 50.59210845858695
To whom thus Eglinton: You mean the will.	 214.85309429878785
But that has been explained, I believe, by jurists.	 60.09089022568331
She was entitled to her widow’s dower	 18.54814816895895
At common law. His legal knowledge was great	 168.30495713865832
Our judges tell us.	 73.43297905468597
Him Satan fleers,	 27.46528477615132
Mocker:	 4.608171674364364
And therefore he left out her name	 122.7771608944329
From the first draft but he did not leave out	 37.995255523105506
The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters,	 73.85010108475048
For his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford	 65.79183030716413
And in London. And therefore when he was urged,	 62.77827533230328
As I believe, to name her	 115.4451107864377
He left her his	 98.67072707996255
Secondbest	 4917.713667662645
Bed.	 4805.270169561878

Leftabed.	 4.608171674364364
Woa!	 4.608171674364364
—Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as	 146.67006262827348
they have still if our peasant plays are true to type.	 77.75116400673372
—He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms and	 47.28434932800302
landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist	 86.84382124929573
shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer. Why did he not leave her	 34.5728192443004
his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in	 56.85266903360686
peace?	 14448.063627469233
—It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr	 112.9823959473622
Secondbest Best said finely.	 97.11227942779921
—_Separatio a mensa et a thalamo_, bettered Buck Mulligan and was	 35.9590960684131
smiled on.	 606.4493289281994
—Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling.	 44.374516868793435
Let me think.	 52.62567989983264
—Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage,	 47.356808755505135
Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays	 55.234505072580724
tribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his	 42.21079127911257
dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don’t forget	 158.71072906978358
Nell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.	 20.083240414644973
—Do you mean he died so? Mr Best asked with slight concern. I mean...	 35.016241844317015
—He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped. A quart of ale is a dish for	 80.39684723517568
a king. O, I must tell you what Dowden said!	 57.086519739874404
—What? asked Besteglinton.	 232.61497075770237
William Shakespeare and company, limited. The people’s William. For	 151.66733784346033
terms apply: E. Dowden, Highfield house...	 191.33036511796755
—Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously. I asked him what he thought	 81.5667038339017
of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard. He lifted his	 65.54240741489279
hands and said: _All we can say is that life ran very high in those	 78.8953400672993
days._ Lovely!	 469.58003843678887
Catamite.	 4.608171674364364
—The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best to	 83.44530285934046
ugling Eglinton.	 175.88802230952453
Steadfast John replied severe:	 51.41664414710778
—The doctor can tell us what those words mean. You cannot eat your cake	 102.93184473086922
and have it.	 85.74739836823164
Sayest thou so? Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?	 79.89935429195064
—And the sense of property, Stephen said. He drew Shylock out of his	 41.375533746859126
own long pocket. The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself	 49.1858909255852
a cornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in the	 15.64961840500251
famine riots. His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship	 65.6812705426752
mentioned by Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing.	 22.85231547804788
He sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted	 16.532543523995667
his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent. How else could	 107.11243754270933
Aubrey’s ostler and callboy get rich quick? All events brought grist to	 44.648222777568
his mill. Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging	 32.01337071847651
and quartering of the queen’s leech Lopez, his jew’s heart being	 47.03921194279026
plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive: _Hamlet_ and _Macbeth_	 83.73186262678671
with the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn	 82.02711429683454
for witchroasting. The lost armada is his jeer in _Love’s Labour Lost_.	 66.4831651525894
His pageants, the histories, sail fullbellied on a tide of Mafeking	 31.069460433148148
enthusiasm. Warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porter’s	 24.716488067000302
theory of equivocation. The _Sea Venture_ comes home from Bermudas and	 51.99953353114254
the play Renan admired is written with Patsy Caliban, our American	 81.27523307343748
cousin. The sugared sonnets follow Sidney’s. As for fay Elizabeth,	 62.17738471551634
otherwise carrotty Bess, the gross virgin who inspired _The Merry Wives	 57.78393572253249
of Windsor_, let some meinherr from Almany grope his life long for	 39.25669160291265
deephid meanings in the depths of the buckbasket.	 4.8738781086507625
I think you’re getting on very nicely. Just mix up a mixture of	 38.05499195368611
theolologicophilolological. _Mingo, minxi, mictum, mingere._	 3.933542382544028
—Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared, expectantly. Your dean	 40.59833192054218
of studies holds he was a holy Roman.	 77.34565750801374
_Sufflaminandus sum._	 252.39441725579402
—He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion French	 72.15918689061577
polisher of Italian scandals.	 21.69603683665332
—A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded. Coleridge called him	 43.37804636963517
myriadminded.	 4.608171674364364
_Amplius. In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit	 25.272787840404494
amicitia inter multos._	 4.206040932916629
—Saint Thomas, Stephen began...	 132.19209559133293
—_Ora pro nobis_, Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.	 81.58794550348449
There he keened a wailing rune.	 15.486720477450765
—_Pogue mahone! Acushla machree!_ It’s destroyed we are from this day!	 28.967276650190634
It’s destroyed we are surely!	 59.37182979631085
All smiled their smiles.	 280.0969478616258
—Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works I enjoy	 213.6625054816591
reading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different	 55.85291158337229
from that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in	 81.44083300001205
his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions. He means that	 78.55407948478505
the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some	 142.05720981277733
stranger who, it may be, hungers for it. Jews, whom christians tax with	 87.72448506897358
avarice, are of all races the most given to intermarriage. Accusations	 38.48044469529705
are made in anger. The christian laws which built up the hoards of the	 34.64200942153549
jews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter) bound their	 141.6384475282248
affections too with hoops of steel. Whether these be sins or virtues	 89.66428433659563
old Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet. But a man who holds so	 75.12008956549614
tightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will	 38.60110909746565
hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls	 74.78839187817461
his wife. No sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his	 77.8515653949959
manservant or his maidservant or his jackass.	 23.092974066769923
—Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned.	 39.134270688615366
—Gentle Will is being roughly handled, gentle Mr Best said gently.	 219.41505799009508
—Which will? gagged sweetly Buck Mulligan. We are getting mixed.	 106.20570448244897
—The will to live, John Eglinton philosophised, for poor Ann, Will’s	 82.69176090149466
widow, is the will to die.	 164.7918863224346
_—Requiescat!_ Stephen prayed.	 87.88801234720678
What of all the will to do?	 98.92040132296572
It has vanished long ago...	 57.71426396931559
—She lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed, the	 38.21183408664174
mobled queen, even though you prove that a bed in those days was as	 111.80815224939735
rare as a motorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of	 98.75522518836668
seven parishes. In old age she takes up with gospellers (one stayed	 74.80340506201661
with her at New Place and drank a quart of sack the town council paid	 79.73851829524155
for but in which bed he slept it skills not to ask) and heard she had a	 110.2747959606914
soul. She read or had read to her his chapbooks preferring them to the	 83.38989052427213
_Merry Wives_ and, loosing her nightly waters on the jordan, she	 40.397932161239424
thought over _Hooks and Eyes for Believers’ Breeches_ and _The most	 133.2621296378044
Spiritual Snuffbox to Make the Most Devout Souls Sneeze_. Venus has	 135.95426701141284
twisted her lips in prayer. Agenbite of inwit: remorse of conscience.	 57.38265632069908
It is an age of exhausted whoredom groping for its god.	 63.592000577490474
—History shows that to be true, _inquit Eglintonus Chronolologos_. The	 53.24261562506009
ages succeed one another. But we have it on high authority that a man’s	 75.53690766930752
worst enemies shall be those of his own house and family. I feel that	 72.90438154618647
Russell is right. What do we care for his wife or father? I should say	 70.85572547737287
that only family poets have family lives. Falstaff was not a family	 160.6808135165372
man. I feel that the fat knight is his supreme creation.	 61.99779020465634
Lean, he lay back. Shy, deny thy kindred, the unco guid. Shy, supping	 94.9425518686896
with the godless, he sneaks the cup. A sire in Ultonian Antrim bade it	 30.82039783139422
him. Visits him here on quarter days. Mr Magee, sir, there’s a	 101.20789640634275
gentleman to see you. Me? Says he’s your father, sir. Give me my	 114.29322012429576
Wordsworth. Enter Magee Mor Matthew, a rugged rough rugheaded kern, in	 27.32466202247003
strossers with a buttoned codpiece, his nether stocks bemired with	 19.64283102332854
clauber of ten forests, a wand of wilding in his hand.	 29.220147417389562
Your own? He knows your old fellow. The widower.	 148.1280353475639
Hurrying to her squalid deathlair from gay Paris on the quayside I	 30.851124552592413
touched his hand. The voice, new warmth, speaking. Dr Bob Kenny is	 165.62001339747803
attending her. The eyes that wish me well. But do not know me.	 107.3477087972999
—A father, Stephen said, battling against hopelessness, is a necessary	 49.56437709258442
evil. He wrote the play in the months that followed his father’s death.	 132.28193199476544
If you hold that he, a greying man with two marriageable daughters,	 62.815416540303076
with thirtyfive years of life, _nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita_,	 20.948522591786638

Wittenberg then you must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the	 72.11899061227665
lustful queen. No. The corpse of John Shakespeare does not walk the	 173.3909765748043
night. From hour to hour it rots and rots. He rests, disarmed of	 69.07893163664627
fatherhood, having devised that mystical estate upon his son.	 84.15495172038813
Boccaccio’s Calandrino was the first and last man who felt himself with	 56.80598037387535
child. Fatherhood, in the sense of conscious begetting, is unknown to	 54.54669210979392
man. It is a mystical estate, an apostolic succession, from only	 86.23691868067036
begetter to only begotten. On that mystery and not on the madonna which	 64.43005350194794
the cunning Italian intellect flung to the mob of Europe the church is	 110.87333164393708
founded and founded irremovably because founded, like the world, macro	 91.58152470451921
and microcosm, upon the void. Upon incertitude, upon unlikelihood.	 46.078484381920596
_Amor matris_, subjective and objective genitive, may be the only true	 29.833931035020726
thing in life. Paternity may be a legal fiction. Who is the father of	 51.578068595216244
any son that any son should love him or he any son?	 167.93438915603494
What the hell are you driving at?	 108.45027584632815

annals of the world, stained with all other incests and bestialities,	 17.797486785541203
hardly record its breach. Sons with mothers, sires with daughters,	 52.06618426281102
lesbic sisters, loves that dare not speak their name, nephews with	 97.3087535694837
grandmothers, jailbirds with keyholes, queens with prize bulls. The son	 24.972505462904365
unborn mars beauty: born, he brings pain, divides affection, increases	 45.752269149165194
care. He is a new male: his growth is his father’s decline, his youth	 107.75849886868335
his father’s envy, his friend his father’s enemy.	 78.03333080641693

—Sabellius, the African, subtlest heresiarch of all the beasts of the	 29.744267576898757
field, held that the Father was Himself His Own Son. The bulldog of	 58.45261644883566
Aquin, with whom no word shall be impossible, refutes him. Well: if the	 64.55703124096713
father who has not a son be not a father can the son who has not a	 108.56087625398526
father be a son? When Rutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare or another	 238.7444963575429
poet of the same name in the comedy of errors wrote _Hamlet_ he was not	 38.33567420517796
the father of his own son merely but, being no more a son, he was and	 46.39373565461211
felt himself the father of all his race, the father of his own	 60.84048121121744
grandfather, the father of his unborn grandson who, by the same token,	 58.984939398938515
never was born, for nature, as Mr Magee understands her, abhors	 78.14065451807167

He clasped his paunchbrow with both birthaiding hands.	 37.934000104919456
—As for his family, Stephen said, his mother’s name lives in the forest	 75.51952910255328
of Arden. Her death brought from him the scene with Volumnia in	 59.72874349830749

Who Cleopatra, fleshpot of Egypt, and Cressid and Venus are we may	 46.346746293136725
guess. But there is another member of his family who is recorded.	 24.753939424401953

Come, mess.	 106.56698729013979
STEPHEN: He had three brothers, Gilbert, Edmund, Richard. Gilbert in	 108.78826161128741
his old age told some cavaliers he got a pass for nowt from Maister	 57.85588449298871
Gatherer one time mass he did and he seen his brud Maister Wull the	 38.62145702405948
playwriter up in Lunnon in a wrastling play wud a man on’s back. The	 40.46905221625815
playhouse sausage filled Gilbert’s soul. He is nowhere: but an Edmund	 82.64441621558949
and a Richard are recorded in the works of sweet William.	 78.61435784084325
MAGEEGLINJOHN: Names! What’s in a name?	 123.9737976333655
BEST: That is my name, Richard, don’t you know. I hope you are going to	 42.93112985045245
say a good word for Richard, don’t you know, for my sake. _(Laughter)_	 57.30660708909099

STEPHEN: In his trinity of black Wills, the villain shakebags, Iago,	 30.690969170190304
Richard Crookback, Edmund in _King Lear_, two bear the wicked uncles’	 151.60612916003828
names. Nay, that last play was written or being written while his	 212.379969717133
brother Edmund lay dying in Southwark.	 113.59455403820539
BEST: I hope Edmund is going to catch it. I don’t want Richard, my name	 56.43310988314384
_(Laughter)_	 6551.2658316472025
QUAKERLYSTER: (_A tempo_) But he that filches from me my good name...	 60.31222111773233
STEPHEN: _(Stringendo)_ He has hidden his own name, a fair name,	 59.35658048116252
William, in the plays, a super here, a clown there, as a painter of old	 58.7267011788553
Italy set his face in a dark corner of his canvas. He has revealed it	 29.848865900842735
in the sonnets where there is Will in overplus. Like John o’Gaunt his	 92.40076987671482
name is dear to him, as dear as the coat and crest he toadied for, on a	 59.04239172057508
bend sable a spear or steeled argent, honorificabilitudinitatibus,	 58.240115023511756
dearer than his glory of greatest shakescene in the country. What’s in	 90.48963067367356
a name? That is what we ask ourselves in childhood when we write the	 86.6716218398264
name that we are told is ours. A star, a daystar, a firedrake, rose at	 114.51033147961653
his birth. It shone by day in the heavens alone, brighter than Venus in	 97.64351460889934
the night, and by night it shone over delta in Cassiopeia, the	 55.39421174456209
recumbent constellation which is the signature of his initial among the	 14.314887764834339
stars. His eyes watched it, lowlying on the horizon, eastward of the	 29.9888482406616
bear, as he walked by the slumberous summer fields at midnight	 78.68045246059357
returning from Shottery and from her arms.	 113.89910089915496
Both satisfied. I too.	 267.99635776977027
Don’t tell them he was nine years old when it was quenched.	 49.74711143279897
And from her arms.	 93.47999098335704
Wait to be wooed and won. Ay, meacock. Who will woo you?	 46.90486833316531

—What is that, Mr Dedalus? the quaker librarian asked. Was it a	 33.35325253642052
celestial phenomenon?	 233.23210149555965
—A star by night, Stephen said. A pillar of the cloud by day.	 81.61657998885497
What more’s to speak?	 94.71990934943949
Stephen looked on his hat, his stick, his boots.	 62.1534293259609
_Stephanos,_ my crown. My sword. His boots are spoiling the shape of my	 56.067821138335304
feet. Buy a pair. Holes in my socks. Handkerchief too.	 80.78631498573144
—You make good use of the name, John Eglinton allowed. Your own name is	 40.89719433789672
strange enough. I suppose it explains your fantastical humour.	 190.6946587869017
Me, Magee and Mulligan.	 281.14820791637777
Fabulous artificer. The hawklike man. You flew. Whereto?	 42.432098853165236
Newhaven-Dieppe, steerage passenger. Paris and back. Lapwing. Icarus.	 48.331501503346594
_Pater, ait._ Seabedabbled, fallen, weltering. Lapwing you are. Lapwing	 45.70516606937154
be.	 1512.3885801292108
Mr Best eagerquietly lifted his book to say:	 66.62612335726256
—That’s very interesting because that brother motive, don’t you know,	 64.53355461482876
we find also in the old Irish myths. Just what you say. The three	 87.81227765356928
brothers Shakespeare. In Grimm too, don’t you know, the fairytales. The	 43.64355683844114
third brother that always marries the sleeping beauty and wins the best	 104.75809722600013
prize.	 7777.95146032377
Best of Best brothers. Good, better, best.	 474.32545778143185
The quaker librarian springhalted near.	 25.805207067848848
—I should like to know, he said, which brother you... I understand you	 113.7384166915085
to suggest there was misconduct with one of the brothers... But perhaps	 87.91422527027834
I am anticipating?	 25.372793602977882
He caught himself in the act: looked at all: refrained.	 67.21574994135649
An attendant from the doorway called:	 55.95546576195581
—Mr Lyster! Father Dineen wants...	 300.40519245778563
—O, Father Dineen! Directly.	 36.39124184994191
Swiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone.	 97.04807655130124
John Eglinton touched the foil.	 14.125853022171086
—Come, he said. Let us hear what you have to say of Richard and Edmund.	 53.40269228380713
You kept them for the last, didn’t you?	 74.89367751874703
—In asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle Richie and	 167.72767271653026
nuncle Edmund, Stephen answered, I feel I am asking too much perhaps. A	 63.89138391312448
brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella.	 190.00022447364333
Lapwing.	 11117.55165057748
Where is your brother? Apothecaries’ hall. My whetstone. Him, then	 146.1782534556195
Cranly, Mulligan: now these. Speech, speech. But act. Act speech. They	 326.065076648859
mock to try you. Act. Be acted on.	 140.1779526134129
Lapwing.	 11117.55165057748
I am tired of my voice, the voice of Esau. My kingdom for a drink.	 62.30874111073097
On.	 231.53714644224158
—You will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he	 62.88724841164541
took the stuff of his plays. Why did he take them rather than others?	 126.03708706841695
Richard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann	 116.95284047427846
(what’s in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow. Richard	 85.78269828770675
the conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered. The	 40.09067626340623
other four acts of that play hang limply from that first. Of all his	 91.80049157318705
kings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare’s reverence,	 93.86033030081391
the angel of the world. Why is the underplot of _King Lear_ in which	 23.774371384985656
Edmund figures lifted out of Sidney’s _Arcadia_ and spatchcocked on to	 42.315772694342044
a Celtic legend older than history?	 50.860995335081554
—That was Will’s way, John Eglinton defended. We should not now combine	 76.44541444042709
a Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George Meredith. _Que	 17.896884369487186
voulez-vous?_ Moore would say. He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and	 48.2507817912298
makes Ulysses quote Aristotle.	 29.92350315618314
—Why? Stephen answered himself. Because the theme of the false or the	 86.86611889468787
usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to	 94.28690116289394
Shakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him. The note of	 152.97267711711123
banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds	 40.624555377651035
uninterruptedly from _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_ onward till Prospero	 31.11093191339887
breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his	 20.077016092440626
book. It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in	 51.225132098084586
another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe.	 51.48007266474151
It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married	 112.87929703852373
daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery. But it	 33.57855057155
was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will	 97.47453889551468
and left in him a strong inclination to evil. The words are those of my	 125.21058601486465
lords bishops of Maynooth. An original sin and, like original sin,	 40.469800790527636
committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned. It is between the	 160.41427526213783
lines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under	 62.20396667793461
which her four bones are not to be laid. Age has not withered it.	 133.07331138561932
Beauty and peace have not done it away. It is in infinite variety	 131.72369617105
everywhere in the world he has created, in _Much Ado about Nothing_,	 88.83700512918746
twice in _As you like It_, in _The Tempest_, in _Hamlet,_ in _Measure	 84.67171009671564
for Measure_—and in all the other plays which I have not read.	 66.04817286490673
He laughed to free his mind from his mind’s bondage.	 113.8796507846658
Judge Eglinton summed up.	 243.0228582125099
—The truth is midway, he affirmed. He is the ghost and the prince. He	 50.22882770986354
is all in all.	 137.43652985371358
—He is, Stephen said. The boy of act one is the mature man of act five.	 54.054698610431366
All in all. In _Cymbeline,_ in _Othello_ he is bawd and cuckold. He	 33.74707071697624
acts and is acted on. Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like José he	 47.078543552410366
kills the real Carmen. His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago	 45.9764814698825
ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer.	 77.92880929934617
—Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly. O word of fear!	 132.9398617944829
Dark dome received, reverbed.	 148.89256444309999
—And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed. When	 44.353082767515374
all is said Dumas _fils_ (or is it Dumas _père?)_ is right. After God	 54.638536240306735
Shakespeare has created most.	 122.99242389956532
—Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said. He returns after	 176.7354083207369
a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has	 94.33560097999307
always been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of	 140.1449454349322
life ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth. Then dies. The	 42.61303423882219
motion is ended. Gravediggers bury Hamlet _père_ and Hamlet _fils._ A	 85.89261495290147
king and a prince at last in death, with incidental music. And, what	 172.59421721964983
though murdered and betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for,	 65.4792980784891
Dane or Dubliner, sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom	 57.575526095557116
they refuse to be divorced. If you like the epilogue look long on it:	 53.44174339389336
prosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa’s lump of	 22.217191418641058
love, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the	 129.4070551033797
place where the bad niggers go. Strong curtain. He found in the world	 85.21794122038374
without as actual what was in his world within as possible. Maeterlinck	 145.87878589658627
says: _If Socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated	 132.5788289025575
on his doorstep. If Judas go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps	 78.05967888622664
will tend._ Every life is many days, day after day. We walk through	 111.0075001369737
ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives,	 343.43665472625287
widows, brothers-in-love, but always meeting ourselves. The playwright	 66.02385171095065
who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light	 66.19725700830918
first and the sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom	 100.59640376473538
the most Roman of catholics call _dio boia_, hangman god, is doubtless	 39.595857714795706
all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and	 64.56058463167777
cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet,	 36.151287927528855
there are no more marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being	 53.72984510308026
a wife unto himself.	 142.40699533443387
_—Eureka!_ Buck Mulligan cried. _Eureka!_	 15.636624767870623
Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton’s	 49.076633729585296
desk.	 21482.986588036838
—May I? he said. The Lord has spoken to Malachi.	 88.88882350776983
He began to scribble on a slip of paper.	 26.81308414077378
Take some slips from the counter going out.	 168.6016575475571
—Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one,	 93.43049586083932
shall live. The rest shall keep as they are.	 142.75255021428669
He laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.	 28.87114260944225
Unwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his	 16.34451756099051

—You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen. You have	 72.38759801891015
brought us all this way to show us a French triangle. Do you believe	 56.27774621736882
your own theory?	 68.24128501521778
—No, Stephen said promptly.	 44.618802679482506
—Are you going to write it? Mr Best asked. You ought to make it a	 19.797348244738057
dialogue, don’t you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.	 29.597649792237423
John Eclecticon doubly smiled.	 141.6535069320673
—Well, in that case, he said, I don’t see why you should expect payment	 57.26273815274799
for it since you don’t believe it yourself. Dowden believes there is	 55.34856959197578
some mystery in _Hamlet_ but will say no more. Herr Bleibtreu, the man	 88.589193493314
Piper met in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes	 141.17365636697758
that the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument. He is going to	 39.86281154852229
visit the present duke, Piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor	 131.40388189064205
wrote the plays. It will come as a surprise to his grace. But he	 120.40985135074017
believes his theory.	 398.0846989635381
I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief. That is, help me to believe or	 69.7447681075834
help me to unbelieve? Who helps to believe? _Egomen._ Who to unbelieve?	 62.44365949966656
Other chap.	 319.0062415089594
—You are the only contributor to _Dana_ who asks for pieces of silver.	 44.55985903135032
Then I don’t know about the next number. Fred Ryan wants space for an	 83.49202611991227
article on economics.	 18.759109753970833
Fraidrine. Two pieces of silver he lent me. Tide you over. Economics.	 107.84289376079559
—For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.	 42.488802764975226
Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then	 40.98659488373384
gravely said, honeying malice:	 126.91878380893291
—I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper	 107.70020873645448
Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the _Summa	 32.57032373076096
contra Gentiles_ in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly	 34.47825905757709
and Rosalie, the coalquay whore.	 30.98300083023991
He broke away.	 49.749197397553864
—Come, Kinch. Come, wandering Ængus of the birds.	 42.849747938676266
Come, Kinch. You have eaten all we left. Ay. I will serve you your orts	 55.576562836778926
and offals.	 15.372472535691111
Stephen rose.	 490.16752388606307
Life is many days. This will end.	 118.55032514840099
—We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said. _Notre ami_ Moore says	 54.88184382060523
Malachi Mulligan must be there.	 73.44805656694312
Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.	 48.627265412269374
—Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth of	 51.869676411117396
Ireland. I’ll be there. Come, Kinch, the bards must drink. Can you walk	 133.1120660901447
straight?	 6553.571875120699
Laughing, he...	 543.5874892574243
Swill till eleven. Irish nights entertainment.	 117.77814025333859
Lubber...	 4.608171674364364
Stephen followed a lubber...	 52.45975581457429
One day in the national library we had a discussion. Shakes. After. His	 50.040132797626704
lub back: I followed. I gall his kibe.	 65.49062834078033
Stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a	 62.13471995804783
wellkempt head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering	 14.95151894845568
daylight of no thought.	 498.9815791459032
What have I learned? Of them? Of me?	 207.06488164227977
Walk like Haines now.	 247.71136430637324
The constant readers’ room. In the readers’ book Cashel Boyle O’Connor	 13.40076357853062
Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell parafes his polysyllables. Item: was Hamlet	 34.556286143627005
mad? The quaker’s pate godlily with a priesteen in booktalk.	 18.1352849943399
—O please do, sir... I shall be most pleased...	 91.34255034867073
Amused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself,	 64.66945043451844
selfnodding:	 4.608171674364364
—A pleased bottom.	 115.89580901666021
The turnstile.	 7.77559996992721
Is that?... Blueribboned hat... Idly writing... What? Looked?...	 204.8166148820506
The curving balustrade: smoothsliding Mincius.	 5.74716311795317
Puck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling:	 46.852978005821626
John Eglinton, my jo, John,	 108.59349313829107
Why won’t you wed a wife?	 91.60107413935458
He spluttered to the air:	 25.491983393437124
—O, the chinless Chinaman! Chin Chon Eg Lin Ton. We went over to their	 31.054533572348316
playbox, Haines and I, the plumbers’ hall. Our players are creating a	 77.5508822197926
new art for Europe like the Greeks or M. Maeterlinck. Abbey Theatre! I	 117.63446656923844
smell the pubic sweat of monks.	 137.64392046668678
He spat blank.	 121.73648814072618
Forgot: any more than he forgot the whipping lousy Lucy gave him. And	 47.82006327749377
left the _femme de trente ans._ And why no other children born? And his	 57.415185282830514
first child a girl?	 190.57711104813256
Afterwit. Go back.	 80.54667476272463
The dour recluse still there (he has his cake) and the douce youngling,	 43.685178592298
minion of pleasure, Phedo’s toyable fair hair.	 72.75634532200334
Eh... I just eh... wanted... I forgot... he...	 213.1812265762032
—Longworth and M’Curdy Atkinson were there...	 21.98920206637718
Puck Mulligan footed featly, trilling:	 14.468640697464854
I hardly hear the purlieu cry	 70.9604967939745
Or a Tommy talk as I pass one by	 106.86877359042782
Before my thoughts begin to run	 91.5128632262719
On F. M’Curdy Atkinson,	 62.70087894834091
The same that had the wooden leg	 104.6202838421445
And that filibustering filibeg	 20.37292200111371
That never dared to slake his drouth,	 62.64676213857253
Magee that had the chinless mouth.	 121.57238734028836
Being afraid to marry on earth	 178.84877058275504
They masturbated for all they were worth.	 49.19700286565826
Jest on. Know thyself.	 88.14476008394537
Halted, below me, a quizzer looks at me. I halt.	 135.01809066237647
—Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned. Synge has left off wearing	 82.22107896196198
black to be like nature. Only crows, priests and English coal are	 171.88822837390694
black.	 1773.5451718065285
A laugh tripped over his lips.	 80.76926029347446
—Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that	 92.88461214025718
old hake Gregory. O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit! She gets you a	 88.23132198978942
job on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus.	 60.95645545224438
Couldn’t you do the Yeats touch?	 130.19784058090846
He went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms:	 53.32091704638807
—The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time.	 46.826419522721295
One thinks of Homer.	 35.37511288894674
He stopped at the stairfoot.	 17.683776351667003
—I have conceived a play for the mummers, he said solemnly.	 33.13005836103543
The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined. Gone the nine men’s	 89.08904279067288
morrice with caps of indices.	 18.828983716218904
In sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet:	 41.85194404535482
_Everyman His Own Wife	 43.2158357681602
or	 922.9179893557414

(a national immorality in three orgasms)	 71.11388750213169
by	 343.92614956489206
Ballocky Mulligan._	 84.90772702380738
He turned a happy patch’s smirk to Stephen, saying:	 35.04790971959252
—The disguise, I fear, is thin. But listen.	 100.6152472915491
He read, _marcato:_	 64.72027019678441
—Characters:	 4.608171674364364

MOTHER GROGAN (a watercarrier)	 20.17221152042594
FRESH NELLY	 233.29782732652097
and	 42.26742598371171
ROSALIE (the coalquay whore).	 25.613441499577583
He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen:	 103.4765071724135
and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men:	 71.08620226610572
—O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift	 53.25994694428352
their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured,	 91.91086328065585
multicoloured, multitudinous vomit!	 4.206040932916629
—The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted	 68.98702541967711
them.	 436.51515115481243
About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.	 106.18438086440135
Part. The moment is now. Where then? If Socrates leave his house today,	 140.74034534515002
if Judas go forth tonight. Why? That lies in space which I in time must	 147.49039895552463
come to, ineluctably.	 27.141226856049943
My will: his will that fronts me. Seas between.	 237.50990740032245
A man passed out between them, bowing, greeting.	 65.30160867885301
—Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.	 26.72496220424842
The portico.	 7.77559996992721
Here I watched the birds for augury. Ængus of the birds. They go, they	 116.79974368948493
come. Last night I flew. Easily flew. Men wondered. Street of harlots	 104.43236949587921
after. A creamfruit melon he held to me. In. You will see.	 46.63316542622119
—The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown’s awe. Did you	 46.97276504105982
see his eye? He looked upon you to lust after you. I fear thee, ancient	 186.18906510531338
mariner. O, Kinch, thou art in peril. Get thee a breechpad.	 84.73312891777239
Manner of Oxenford.	 51.99350777645438
Day. Wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge.	 540.4508071951777
A dark back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway,	 109.52055069916959
under portcullis barbs.	 35.062215207900934
They followed.	 102.82988299584495
Offend me still. Speak on.	 171.20699542404773
Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street. No birds.	 80.50749143191557
Frail from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in	 18.686952959053528
a flaw of softness softly were blown.	 49.43377349733255
Cease to strive. Peace of the druid priests of Cymbeline: hierophantic:	 49.272804830079565
from wide earth an altar.	 259.7291524702018
Laud we the gods	 218.5278009280604
And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils	 62.29908671419724
From our bless’d altars.	 25.407418056855512
[ 10 ]	 463.94842625767166
The superior, the very reverend John Conmee S. J. reset his smooth	 15.476137147776262
watch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps. Five	 59.419320717821925
to three. Just nice time to walk to Artane. What was that boy’s name	 96.04351269802258
again? Dignam. Yes. _Vere dignum et iustum est._ Brother Swan was the	 105.30454877815549
person to see. Mr Cunningham’s letter. Yes. Oblige him, if possible.	 209.10101098013632
Good practical catholic: useful at mission time.	 203.36460394906305
A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his	 51.98562020271101
crutches, growled some notes. He jerked short before the convent of the	 110.2713872301355
sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very	 43.39874208688628
reverend John Conmee S. J. Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his	 19.11579234558349
purse held, he knew, one silver crown.	 326.66755180971717
Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square. He thought, but not for long,	 88.9173092529575
of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs,	 47.30912463471244
ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey’s words:	 131.44902663640747
_If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have	 64.23860428199811
abandoned me in my old days._ He walked by the treeshade of	 40.03005888913257
sunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy	 76.85892958729708
M.P.	 4.608171674364364
—Very well, indeed, father. And you, father?	 179.58670875078454
Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed. He would go to Buxton	 26.550352201611005
probably for the waters. And her boys, were they getting on well at	 146.50665810306174
Belvedere? Was that so? Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear	 48.57628468148013
that. And Mr Sheehy himself? Still in London. The house was still	 136.93736203212248
sitting, to be sure it was. Beautiful weather it was, delightful	 39.12728822271497
indeed. Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would	 90.63655411759346
come again to preach. O, yes: a very great success. A wonderful man	 63.67452356845658
really.	 6192.944003626397
Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P.	 14.535584201864713
Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M.P.	 45.5784431619739
Yes, he would certainly call.	 120.44814272213145
—Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.	 32.71777502932684
Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the	 36.38265354791952
jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun. And smiled yet again,	 72.17167675492212
in going. He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.	 45.49886723485483
Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father	 108.04228184818668
Bernard Vaughan’s droll eyes and cockney voice.	 65.48983658241472
—Pilate! Wy don’t you old back that owlin mob?	 83.6597923431303
A zealous man, however. Really he was. And really did great good in his	 64.2009907054143
way. Beyond a doubt. He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish.	 75.6377019244949
Of good family too would one think it? Welsh, were they not?	 198.04892296458576
O, lest he forget. That letter to father provincial.	 78.24760194700957
Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy	 44.41518573639192
square. Yes: they were from Belvedere. The little house. Aha. And were	 142.27891602048578
they good boys at school? O. That was very good now. And what was his	 81.45876513707528
name? Jack Sohan. And his name? Ger. Gallaher. And the other little	 88.37632951144178
man? His name was Brunny Lynam. O, that was a very nice name to have.	 44.677979340233655
Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and	 36.20001786559405
pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.	 48.56821183378203
—But mind you don’t post yourself into the box, little man, he said.	 63.13199797348886
The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:	 90.34486838384755
—O, sir.	 236.93975563845925
—Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.	 36.99735507538418
Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee’s letter	 144.50942075987572
to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox. Father	 68.56272994246581
Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square	 35.00509598352189
east.	 11392.218010782903
Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slate	 54.5036120082938
frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender	 130.14889805942548
trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave	 100.96899679297701
deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady	 94.10422970735006
Maxwell at the corner of Dignam’s court.	 39.87995056309699
Was that not Mrs M’Guinness?	 120.9866425220975
Mrs M’Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the	 35.291397275306785
farther footpath along which she sailed. And Father Conmee smiled and	 86.4440014432224
saluted. How did she do?	 154.34444468637182
A fine carriage she had. Like Mary, queen of Scots, something. And to	 99.14347269287342
think that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a... what should he	 99.2310359099882
say?... such a queenly mien.	 184.707908148865
Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the	 49.1655826112815
shutup free church on his left. The reverend T. R. Greene B.A. will	 115.91520427958464
(D.V.) speak. The incumbent they called him. He felt it incumbent on	 47.15103989840793
him to say a few words. But one should be charitable. Invincible	 37.60993853670217
ignorance. They acted according to their lights.	 42.015051715921246
Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular	 40.08882601546166
road. It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an	 62.349084326105476
important thoroughfare. Surely, there ought to be.	 93.56367784402178
A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street. All	 99.38785120278519
raised untidy caps. Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly.	 114.76938464739642
Christian brother boys.	 320.2297547663494
Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked. Saint	 35.447121632614696
Joseph’s church, Portland row. For aged and virtuous females. Father	 162.76329094091182
Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament. Virtuous: but	 41.10343578491664
occasionally they were also badtempered.	 30.195185566459283
Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift	 62.15638650609335
nobleman. And now it was an office or something.	 170.50333974583825
Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted	 43.906747003462826
by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop. Father	 56.8836619356678
Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came	 27.319953793855124
from baconflitches and ample cools of butter. He passed Grogan’s the	 61.37798002530869
Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful	 181.05821682795084
catastrophe in New York. In America those things were continually	 72.51680080290576
happening. Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared. Still, an	 72.24100868029588
act of perfect contrition.	 77.5964567911413
Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin’s publichouse against the window of	 19.18487715189653
which two unlabouring men lounged. They saluted him and were saluted.	 91.53582270768055
Father Conmee passed H. J. O’Neill’s funeral establishment where Corny	 99.14067617418121
Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay.	 62.39277437701213
A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted	 50.017915724501385
the constable. In Youkstetter’s, the porkbutcher’s, Father Conmee	 33.033743399741276
observed pig’s puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in	 136.22473022765408
tubes.	 4.608171674364364
Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a	 20.764611418690407
turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty	 42.61655040412111
straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above	 67.81161241531997
him. It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of	 21.362228653185603
the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out	 44.68216474223215
and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor	 79.5392974063595
people.	 3088.746527313636
On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S. J. of saint Francis	 15.528742543826246
Xavier’s church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound	 63.19683854133444
tram.	 6524.107075918893
Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C. C. of	 30.966705032910838
saint Agatha’s church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.	 133.03939167077377
At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for	 34.90724860101232
he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.	 71.26934850618638
Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with	 20.331648047435447
care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a	 74.39946833073661
sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into	 90.08558025888672
his purse. Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket	 70.22842935926748
inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away	 88.53854912156
the ticket. The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father	 20.814539224399542
Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap. Father Conmee liked	 59.93800464108756
cheerful decorum.	 4.411654744205047
It was a peaceful day. The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father	 49.64494158781081
Conmee had finished explaining and looked down. His wife, Father Conmee	 81.69382262048624
supposed. A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman	 42.895448136584235
with the glasses. She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so	 71.8328946328256
gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and	 86.34209690248484
smiled tinily, sweetly.	 60.305841523424775
Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. He perceived also that	 54.3056399069094
the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the	 32.36705541083024
seat.	 5805.074776893193
Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the	 33.35064529712137
mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.	 101.3882681627927
At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old	 71.39618496128888
woman rose suddenly from her place to alight. The conductor pulled the	 78.8001836163037
bellstrap to stay the car for her. She passed out with her basket and a	 55.889451098569005
marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and	 24.781886413668637
basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed	 68.86778625647062
the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had	 50.70630459822693
always to be told twice _bless you, my child,_ that they have been	 92.4304981234677
absolved, _pray for me._ But they had so many worries in life, so many	 37.97047243333431
cares, poor creatures.	 42.372897844008854
From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at	 22.725279605899267
Father Conmee.	 24.438202572624977
Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men	 51.96167461842081
and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S. J. and the African mission	 30.622541997587067
and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and	 27.004102455973957
brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when	 79.24336573600375
their last hour came like a thief in the night. That book by the	 69.44735458381052
Belgian jesuit, _Le Nombre des Élus,_ seemed to Father Conmee a	 28.42688322316512
reasonable plea. Those were millions of human souls created by God in	 31.827141562818355
His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (D.V.) been brought. But	 133.935807461581
they were God’s souls, created by God. It seemed to Father Conmee a	 39.27565336907811
pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.	 152.17577778525794
At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the	 62.589569324387156
conductor and saluted in his turn.	 56.90632736898197
The Malahide road was quiet. It pleased Father Conmee, road and name.	 198.77579629211587
The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide. Lord Talbot de Malahide,	 32.71400198743621
immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining.	 218.33122745044702
Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day.	 130.87522216328108
Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old	 103.41001752114889
times in the barony.	 27.69400456869693
Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book _Old Times in the	 46.168058297449114
Barony_ and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and	 57.64177979886692
of Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of	 76.36572630471176
Belvedere.	 9173.218261784712
A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel,	 67.9309630242953
Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening,	 130.65839372704517
not startled when an otter plunged. Who could know the truth? Not the	 119.06053749951418
jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed	 47.915356017985594
adultery fully, _eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris,_ with	 4.972698259615729
her husband’s brother? She would half confess if she had not all sinned	 86.763467923769
as women did. Only God knew and she and he, her husband’s brother.	 320.85110592948473
Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however	 45.20938562607456
for man’s race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our	 82.62575033565778
ways.	 10879.180764854025
Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore. He was humane and	 77.13574343804844
honoured there. He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at	 80.77779833316276
smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit	 62.076957330110424
clusters. And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble,	 57.70936677704493
were impalmed by Don John Conmee.	 131.53954382716734
It was a charming day.	 102.680867320309
The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages,	 23.365142151855004
curtseying to him with ample underleaves. The sky showed him a flock of	 30.677915348715167
small white clouds going slowly down the wind. _Moutonner,_ the French	 154.1489667136239
said. A just and homely word.	 452.90911174419836
Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds	 56.2935383003089
over Rathcoffey. His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of	 21.118023259442143
Clongowes field. He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the	 120.52586017604794
cries of the boys’ lines at their play, young cries in the quiet	 103.00624705017606
evening. He was their rector: his reign was mild.	 105.0010527559482
Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out.	 36.9579228553681
An ivory bookmark told him the page.	 110.71162526685858
Nones. He should have read that before lunch. But lady Maxwell had	 128.72495228701865
come.	 382.81606238906494
Father Conmee read in secret _Pater_ and _Ave_ and crossed his breast.	 41.83393395877692
_Deus in adiutorium._	 121.45187994305914
He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he	 63.89082520445448
came to _Res_ in _Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas:	 9.172501545189713
in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ tuæ._	 6.947106330169723
A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a	 60.08025716425269
young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand. The young man raised	 123.88318728705386
his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care	 38.85881657925984
detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.	 31.327440208191124
Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his	 67.7995613237038
breviary. _Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis	 32.98266490256704
formidavit cor meum._	 4.206040932916629
Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping	 47.390214896317715
eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner. He pulled himself erect,	 34.15109822450885
went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass	 69.42894913547057
furnishings. Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came	 60.44665654467294
to the doorway. There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes	 51.98433007365269
and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.	 61.91271004570609
Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.	 38.2551948150723
Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat	 54.41200521541532
downtilted, chewing his blade of hay.	 46.30814613990225
Constable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.	 94.72795692913846
—That’s a fine day, Mr Kelleher.	 77.05248090344273
—Ay, Corny Kelleher said.	 26.8137139356613
—It’s very close, the constable said.	 86.91890665756384
Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth	 19.284250419322316
while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a	 103.09225845360476
coin.	 10953.063523789304
—What’s the best news? he asked.	 36.34827418161731
—I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with	 122.49570143502385
bated breath.	 126.96932568446691
A onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell’s corner, skirting	 90.62015939113597
Rabaiotti’s icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street. Towards	 57.53213209921682
Larry O’Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably:	 60.3768317809633
—_For England_...	 146.1370039518697
He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted	 49.77335296723099
and growled:	 214.89164458114357
—_home and beauty._	 262.13797336051874
J. J. O’Molloy’s white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in	 112.06133456511508
the warehouse with a visitor.	 9.559839755174034
A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it	 81.19917524472973
into the cap held out to her. The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced	 110.0876942938547
sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself	 29.28136281703295
forward four strides.	 361.5517927983719
He halted and growled angrily:	 44.15233746284717
—_For England_...	 146.1370039518697
Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him,	 117.0304354105691
gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.	 87.39687854838044
He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head	 91.04460679854967
towards a window and bayed deeply:	 225.36809613935438
—_home and beauty._	 262.13797336051874
The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased.	 107.69691009026229
The blind of the window was drawn aside. A card _Unfurnished	 75.03990167459406
Apartments_ slipped from the sash and fell. A plump bare generous arm	 66.33605730176716
shone, was seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut	 85.09361943712132
shiftstraps. A woman’s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings.	 60.51198143536098
It fell on the path.	 120.01607167148262
One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the	 34.389144385129136
minstrel’s cap, saying:	 140.5665643168613
—There, sir.	 729.5860545600094
Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming	 30.209769022241257
kitchen.	 9085.467337416889
—Did you put in the books? Boody asked.	 38.038532602890506
Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds	 44.052542951329315
twice with her potstick and wiped her brow.	 62.95559821417848
—They wouldn’t give anything on them, she said.	 51.303856077165186
Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles	 28.296832706515655
tickled by stubble.	 109.62707536297782
—Where did you try? Boody asked.	 27.64548347329876
—M’Guinness’s.	 4.608171674364364
Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.	 43.11779641394253
—Bad cess to her big face! she cried.	 108.05523380803132
Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.	 47.79469926805068
—What’s in the pot? she asked.	 79.97854072218182
—Shirts, Maggy said.	 64.23447264561008
Boody cried angrily:	 159.3327615073464
—Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?	 79.49299865172482
Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked:	 66.30454216766698
—And what’s in this?	 119.26318186237616
A heavy fume gushed in answer.	 51.22368570046673
—Peasoup, Maggy said.	 70.45780949957312
—Where did you get it? Katey asked.	 44.028026088720935
—Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.	 87.78067490628122
The lacquey rang his bell.	 21.95730307226378
—Barang!	 4.608171674364364
Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily:	 24.361284780632015
—Give us it here.	 97.97220142932979
Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl. Katey,	 106.53047580459102
sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her	 109.17132846382833
mouth random crumbs:	 54.30801528205169
—A good job we have that much. Where’s Dilly?	 67.81054913504437
—Gone to meet father, Maggy said.	 92.08367826492504
Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added:	 68.50955062948668
—Our father who art not in heaven.	 136.29151004583278
Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey’s bowl, exclaimed:	 140.26634669313447
—Boody! For shame!	 874.2474391281121
A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the	 29.021393860132335
Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed	 102.45798858644595
around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains,	 19.866284275165462
between the Customhouse old dock and George’s quay.	 60.689978948625175
The blond girl in Thornton’s bedded the wicker basket with rustling	 32.638477866727484
fibre. Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper	 57.973630966430356
and a small jar.	 57.50341472067426
—Put these in first, will you? he said.	 173.34215696270218
—Yes, sir, the blond girl said. And the fruit on top.	 67.12146745917458
—That’ll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.	 107.29036118482303
She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe	 108.19438383111113
shamefaced peaches.	 4.411654744205047
Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the	 52.484642531207236
fruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red	 89.96080241984593
tomatoes, sniffing smells.	 91.13910552664088
H. E. L. Y.’S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane,	 51.52319729245925
plodding towards their goal.	 90.81982660858343
He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from	 47.433203015880196
his fob and held it at its chain’s length.	 54.691893248978545
—Can you send them by tram? Now?	 78.86351606604572
A darkbacked figure under Merchants’ arch scanned books on the hawker’s	 42.859313739873215
cart.	 6254.4763702863875
—Certainly, sir. Is it in the city?	 58.60972444668053
—O, yes, Blazes Boylan said. Ten minutes.	 35.16394886322793
The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.	 25.302224867026222
—Will you write the address, sir?	 117.77724541179272
Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.	 73.96081808796401
—Send it at once, will you? he said. It’s for an invalid.	 54.53091184679416
—Yes, sir. I will, sir.	 46.72527609485801
Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers’ pocket.	 33.581764082822204
—What’s the damage? he asked.	 55.50921321499005
The blond girl’s slim fingers reckoned the fruits.	 96.84385442210638
Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse. A young pullet. He	 47.25483451622473
took a red carnation from the tall stemglass.	 56.4459783677873
—This for me? he asked gallantly.	 67.86915264636183
The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie	 40.99678064073274
a bit crooked, blushing.	 160.8634594114435
—Yes, sir, she said.	 22.608735763835902
Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.	 68.4663720822883
Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the	 21.314905786365344
red flower between his smiling teeth.	 115.94000630685058
—May I say a word to your telephone, missy? he asked roguishly.	 49.54783123084435
_—Ma!_ Almidano Artifoni said.	 39.12694983476041
He gazed over Stephen’s shoulder at Goldsmith’s knobby poll.	 49.30381240546184
Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore,	 106.8378737284726
gripping the handrests. Palefaces. Men’s arms frankly round their	 35.22350228896633
stunted forms. They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of	 151.2634938991058
the bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.	 29.772675520353513
—_Anch’io ho avuto di queste idee_, Almidano Artifoni said, _quand’ ero	 17.885775531588926
giovine come Lei. Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo è una bestia. È	 10.379247104014265
peccato. Perchè la sua voce... sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via.	 11.666414371667962
Invece, Lei si sacrifica._	 29.598191836908686
—_Sacrifizio incruento,_ Stephen said smiling, swaying his ashplant in	 23.879451930138924
slow swingswong from its midpoint, lightly.	 119.81044842229431
_—Speriamo,_ the round mustachioed face said pleasantly. _Ma, dia retta	 63.76856978643843
a me. Ci rifletta_.	 93.81162881488379
By the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram	 127.0280456211137
unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.	 32.77447131999212
—_Ci rifletterò,_ Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.	 22.07319030015052
—_Ma, sul serio, eh?_ Almidano Artifoni said.	 38.74196442816035
His heavy hand took Stephen’s firmly. Human eyes. They gazed curiously	 111.52590280143312
an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.	 85.57218360373881
_—Eccolo,_ Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste. _Venga a trovarmi	 18.23980890228124
e ci pensi. Addio, caro._	 25.2868968839971
—_Arrivederla, maestro,_ Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand	 24.06651920785583
was freed. _E grazie._	 98.61108502991503
—_Di che?_ Almidano Artifoni said. _Scusi, eh? Tante belle cose!_	 53.065249564011
Almidano Artifoni, holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal,	 93.99664590278853
trotted on stout trousers after the Dalkey tram. In vain he trotted,	 110.83855696817278
signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling	 9.57736054129302
implements of music through Trinity gates.	 158.26939167056335
Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of _The Woman in White_	 135.7826176738381
far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her	 46.79505627172164
typewriter.	 4.608171674364364
Too much mystery business in it. Is he in love with that one, Marion?	 86.4521220936053
Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.	 113.37548576878201
The disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them:	 19.302810631139916
six.	 4180.5722083761
Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard:	 21.278494657782268
—16 June 1904.	 39.62445553383712
Five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny’s corner and the slab	 56.71080616427034
where Wolfe Tone’s statue was not, eeled themselves turning H. E. L.	 54.09539047934862
Y.’S and plodded back as they had come.	 31.312211843425256
Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming	 43.03269130862229
soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens	 31.04120901124283
and capital esses. Mustard hair and dauby cheeks. She’s not	 95.30922738054197
nicelooking, is she? The way she’s holding up her bit of a skirt.	 74.26181993168316
Wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight. If I could get that	 105.41998457812946
dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle’s. They kick out	 46.97864953288563
grand. Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her.	 51.630857334034026
Hope to goodness he won’t keep me here till seven.	 167.9692311500866
The telephone rang rudely by her ear.	 76.06804576736636
—Hello. Yes, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. I’ll ring them up after five. Only	 51.18491557451786
those two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool. All right, sir. Then I can	 140.49248205448205
go after six if you’re not back. A quarter after. Yes, sir. Twentyseven	 171.69482597177674
and six. I’ll tell him. Yes: one, seven, six.	 89.28566139069775
She scribbled three figures on an envelope.	 105.13292302933576
—Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from _Sport_ was in looking for you.	 112.90602673730888
Mr Lenehan, yes. He said he’ll be in the Ormond at four. No, sir. Yes,	 74.9484286020222
sir. I’ll ring them up after five.	 83.35653943076956
Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.	 28.23285518100886
—Who’s that? Ned Lambert asked. Is that Crotty?	 41.37485837920184
—Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.	 19.16219710019821
—Hello, Jack, is that yourself? Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his	 52.164421654295616
pliant lath among the flickering arches. Come on. Mind your steps	 74.54932231814921
there.	 325.19338902170557
The vesta in the clergyman’s uplifted hand consumed itself in a long	 24.490779337716713
soft flame and was let fall. At their feet its red speck died: and	 96.97145910706408
mouldy air closed round them.	 103.24303203489171
—How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.	 47.644175661717846
—Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily. We are standing in the historic	 11.891598301559094
council chamber of saint Mary’s abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed	 74.01820993653584
himself a rebel in 1534. This is the most historic spot in all Dublin.	 96.11558809539996
O’Madden Burke is going to write something about it one of these days.	 42.068638412612316
The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and	 64.00116380379723
the original jews’ temple was here too before they built their	 190.37929609848297
synagogue over in Adelaide road. You were never here before, Jack, were	 103.1193935153728
you?	 149.54238275787918
—No, Ned.	 169.2274171435875
—He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory	 115.23701695479674
serves me. The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court.	 30.257154507161005
—That’s right, Ned Lambert said. That’s quite right, sir.	 20.241168379186483
—If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to	 36.48905970369197
allow me perhaps...	 153.60721289989556
—Certainly, Ned Lambert said. Bring the camera whenever you like. I’ll	 54.766862155203825
get those bags cleared away from the windows. You can take it from here	 89.90340055817762
or from here.	 491.7871123213244
In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the	 72.38872635305967
piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor.	 49.39023084080453
From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.	 49.70092694839531
—I’m deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said. I won’t trespass	 69.18894219495509
on your valuable time...	 115.31484710702685
—You’re welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said. Drop in whenever you like. Next	 55.64861044142244
week, say. Can you see?	 192.56177900646662
—Yes, yes. Good afternoon, Mr Lambert. Very pleased to have met you.	 43.2311205072387
—Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.	 83.26623441390763
He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away	 27.57745478120304
among the pillars. With J. J. O’Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary’s	 53.65340953546789
abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut	 41.55458682695918
meal, O’Connor, Wexford.	 1388.4136473935941
He stood to read the card in his hand.	 44.04678731625057
—The reverend Hugh C. Love, Rathcoffey. Present address: Saint	 59.03926685245803
Michael’s, Sallins. Nice young chap he is. He’s writing a book about	 118.87557551819711
the Fitzgeralds he told me. He’s well up in history, faith.	 41.98115803805134
The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging	 47.612493105841565
twig.	 17510.742321107085
—I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J. J. O’Molloy said.	 24.45354762154503
Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.	 20.70637483989585
—God! he cried. I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare	 71.68047002724155
after he set fire to Cashel cathedral. You know that one? _I’m bloody	 117.3589832977659
sorry I did it,_ says he, _but I declare to God I thought the	 69.15530595732436
archbishop was inside._ He mightn’t like it, though. What? God, I’ll	 235.05192282947885
tell him anyhow. That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor. Hot	 61.59533277020115
members they were all of them, the Geraldines.	 77.00489486341897
The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness. He	 76.7476239964409
slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried:	 53.95730072727325
—Woa, sonny!	 4.411654744205047
He turned to J. J. O’Molloy and asked:	 28.05992632890314
—Well, Jack. What is it? What’s the trouble? Wait awhile. Hold hard.	 65.11986311645464
With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an	 145.86507114337005
instant, sneezed loudly.	 633.5909951126094
—Chow! he said. Blast you!	 34.19999914310901
—The dust from those sacks, J. J. O’Molloy said politely.	 34.8252287338462
—No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a... cold night before... blast your	 74.94362951344146
soul... night before last... and there was a hell of a lot of	 66.88921540264195
draught...	 24847.062305513628
He held his handkerchief ready for the coming...	 43.78319604564931
—I was... Glasnevin this morning... poor little... what do you call	 31.933375398845296
him... Chow!... Mother of Moses!	 276.7892013822535
Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his	 46.065990475837374
claret waistcoat.	 380.77770917740185
—See? he said. Say it’s turn six. In here, see. Turn Now On.	 197.4305671706628
He slid it into the left slot for them. It shot down the groove,	 38.7104349400142
wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six.	 49.99257758149375
Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the	 40.173927050678245
consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying	 51.59327108713455
the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the	 18.746224496975408
admiralty division of king’s bench to the court of appeal an elderly	 38.41959963383949
female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of	 119.1430052162161
great amplitude.	 149.2565595351944
—See? he said. See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over.	 130.02435556898226
The impact. Leverage, see?	 27.936446700603494
He showed them the rising column of disks on the right.	 35.554208175187526
—Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. So a fellow coming in late	 58.34380195347516
can see what turn is on and what turns are over.	 185.85558004395054
—See? Tom Rochford said.	 35.786315317281016
He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle,	 43.54282064818653
stop: four. Turn Now On.	 345.75258216160006
—I’ll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him. One good	 85.33352703591136
turn deserves another.	 291.8073116071394
—Do, Tom Rochford said. Tell him I’m Boylan with impatience.	 53.56107845598876
—Goodnight, M’Coy said abruptly. When you two begin...	 62.53597910695788
Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.	 51.24340756437032
—But how does it work here, Tommy? he asked.	 150.15646389617356
—Tooraloo, Lenehan said. See you later.	 90.80655362131407
He followed M’Coy out across the tiny square of Crampton court.	 119.02701009140365
—He’s a hero, he said simply.	 89.40635042675642
—I know, M’Coy said. The drain, you mean.	 24.76790181975525
—Drain? Lenehan said. It was down a manhole.	 29.20475192902509
They passed Dan Lowry’s musichall where Marie Kendall, charming	 62.22810055041853
soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.	 161.9427363171676
Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall	 71.5795287820364
Lenehan showed M’Coy how the whole thing was. One of those manholes	 84.48237625852168
like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it,	 33.76937629897938
half choked with sewer gas. Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky’s vest	 86.3187830965444
and all, with the rope round him. And be damned but he got the rope	 62.93802426283253
round the poor devil and the two were hauled up.	 65.54591973838673
—The act of a hero, he said.	 42.300488192530686
At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past	 83.31124677646594
them for Jervis street.	 78.8098943883454
—This way, he said, walking to the right. I want to pop into Lynam’s to	 53.094524332626264
see Sceptre’s starting price. What’s the time by your gold watch and	 77.32706603595624
chain?	 8915.076341241416
M’Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses’ sombre office, then at	 52.65439721620664
O’Neill’s clock.	 157.6532020140861
—After three, he said. Who’s riding her?	 213.95776971427276
—O. Madden, Lenehan said. And a game filly she is.	 73.70999133282253
While he waited in Temple bar M’Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle	 73.557080924726
pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter. Fellow might damn easy	 39.96600952097519
get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.	 113.50617432041122
The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal	 76.10938030683025
cavalcade.	 19820.747128735104
—Even money, Lenehan said returning. I knocked against Bantam Lyons in	 69.97221791055128
there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn’t an	 103.25126861153878
earthly. Through here.	 215.76336384333223
They went up the steps and under Merchants’ arch. A darkbacked figure	 62.272869543303216
scanned books on the hawker’s cart.	 51.85810950653118
—There he is, Lenehan said.	 49.795730722684084
—Wonder what he’s buying, M’Coy said, glancing behind.	 95.14014783390664
—_Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye,_ Lenehan said.	 35.72736285865067
—He’s dead nuts on sales, M’Coy said. I was with him one day and he	 34.361489069811256
bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob. There were	 139.91187644457892
fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and	 94.82703658350424
comets with long tails. Astronomy it was about.	 32.419825372477895
Lenehan laughed.	 360.6494160018914
—I’ll tell you a damn good one about comets’ tails, he said. Come over	 63.72429924499621
in the sun.	 34.33465709746614
They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the	 38.72726080014334
riverwall.	 4.608171674364364
Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan’s, late Fehrenbach’s,	 21.748604104940046
carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.	 65.54358993670368
—There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said	 50.1425736368125
eagerly. The annual dinner, you know. Boiled shirt affair. The lord	 90.1108672606982
mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan	 131.84240869753103
Dawson spoke and there was music. Bartell d’Arcy sang and Benjamin	 69.64387048190467
Dollard...	 3453.3844196903106
—I know, M’Coy broke in. My missus sang there once.	 69.31693894480155
—Did she? Lenehan said.	 158.27353387908175
A card _Unfurnished Apartments_ reappeared on the windowsash of number	 21.98941162105742
7 Eccles street.	 45.83086342418729
He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.	 62.036467222346104
—But wait till I tell you, he said. Delahunt of Camden street had the	 21.94696760634847
catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher. Bloom and the wife	 50.892291708921775
were there. Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and	 66.28793429044404
curacoa to which we did ample justice. Fast and furious it was. After	 51.476044925129855
liquids came solids. Cold joints galore and mince pies...	 19.984938094400807
—I know, M’Coy said. The year the missus was there...	 34.89928190773993
Lenehan linked his arm warmly.	 37.409002985350305
—But wait till I tell you, he said. We had a midnight lunch too after	 24.034640108852773
all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o’clock the	 46.6325159641532
morning after the night before. Coming home it was a gorgeous winter’s	 57.83425593218113
night on the Featherbed Mountain. Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one	 105.57922164810549
side of the car and I was with the wife on the other. We started	 57.14085511252539
singing glees and duets: _Lo, the early beam of morning_. She was well	 104.97198237467096
primed with a good load of Delahunt’s port under her bellyband. Every	 31.934123346542457
jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me. Hell’s	 47.11777286217133
delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her. Like that.	 64.68849484138165
He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:	 58.64977595234121
—I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time.	 29.16667090640517
Know what I mean?	 31.960035009376558
His hands moulded ample curves of air. He shut his eyes tight in	 71.13454556016414
delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.	 80.83625463628286
—The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh. She’s a gamey	 59.43438119108554
mare and no mistake. Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the	 92.65069885439581
comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear	 61.69747625250269
and Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot. But, by God, I	 38.921877140330395
was lost, so to speak, in the milky way. He knows them all, faith. At	 56.35054873854188
last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away. _And what star is that,	 59.59960832760244
Poldy?_ says she. By God, she had Bloom cornered. _That one, is it?_	 80.1171934407334
says Chris Callinan, _sure that’s only what you might call a pinprick._	 61.771702447373706
By God, he wasn’t far wide of the mark.	 92.10761411421458
Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft	 70.55820198667132
laughter.	 6551.2658316472025
—I’m weak, he gasped.	 94.52360321278323
M’Coy’s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave. Lenehan	 104.4497184746203
walked on again. He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead	 25.07564516497976
rapidly. He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M’Coy.	 104.52855439384791
—He’s a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously. He’s not one	 59.326485624061505
of your common or garden... you know... There’s a touch of the artist	 79.46233862197303
about old Bloom.	 335.9396107171752
Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of _The Awful Disclosures of Maria	 33.00428617473317
Monk_, then of Aristotle’s _Masterpiece._ Crooked botched print.	 89.67011637251402
Plates: infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of	 33.529494349612925
slaughtered cows. Lots of them like that at this moment all over the	 51.05691190614999
world. All butting with their skulls to get out of it. Child born every	 53.523790617564124
minute somewhere. Mrs Purefoy.	 184.44697646496525
He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: _Tales of the	 39.61272357237913
Ghetto_ by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.	 21.089896379994208
—That I had, he said, pushing it by.	 44.709091180201234
The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.	 73.05757184564332
—Them are two good ones, he said.	 77.69819969289325
Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth.	 57.7120372946806
He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his	 55.612287576881755
unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.	 60.63489557700217
On O’Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay	 93.38192583376558
apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c.	 27.878299412376155
Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles. _Fair Tyrants_ by James	 51.613392348245995
Lovebirch. Know the kind that is. Had it? Yes.	 184.6264634723727
He opened it. Thought so.	 149.77002845703237
A woman’s voice behind the dingy curtain. Listen: the man.	 53.15913076615841
No: she wouldn’t like that much. Got her it once.	 121.11355953860928
He read the other title: _Sweets of Sin_. More in her line. Let us see.	 67.99881414250744
He read where his finger opened.	 109.06039018954662
_—All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on	 69.82021986564985
wondrous gowns and costliest frillies. For him! For Raoul!_	 30.369153063557278
Yes. This. Here. Try.	 346.9765638012561
—_Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands	 46.93582281329753
felt for the opulent curves inside her déshabillé._	 11.922788580488508
Yes. Take this. The end.	 150.68516970391426
—You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare.	 33.35342244783145
The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her	 33.15280736340616
queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint. An imperceptible smile played	 96.77275316547912
round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly.	 82.29592178844307
Mr Bloom read again: _The beautiful woman._	 46.604162156133604
Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh. Flesh yielded amply	 70.45676008079154
amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up. His nostrils arched	 100.3236579283854
themselves for prey. Melting breast ointments (_for him! For Raoul!_).	 129.67545779843462
Armpits’ oniony sweat. Fishgluey slime (_her heaving embonpoint!_).	 25.58100244790985
Feel! Press! Crished! Sulphur dung of lions!	 68.37802495193192
Young! Young!	 498.45011462051576
An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of	 30.370307805010334
chancery, king’s bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the	 49.25342290580406
lord chancellor’s court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the	 57.30946920498029
admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the	 4.903057066861723
Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of	 20.422538517230915
appeal reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean	 49.13134258464548
Accident and Guarantee Corporation.	 211.3228198025298
Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy	 50.636567896587316
curtains. The shopman’s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven	 48.0092886766856
reddened face, coughing. He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on	 33.23500082968655
the floor. He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along	 93.9902555049322
it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.	 56.4787764087251
Mr Bloom beheld it.	 36.16229887853767
Mastering his troubled breath, he said:	 41.85433829086147
—I’ll take this one.	 79.99270952840794
The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.	 56.37559483494365
—_Sweets of Sin,_ he said, tapping on it. That’s a good one.	 56.92483445929622
The lacquey by the door of Dillon’s auctionrooms shook his handbell	 55.49241576794655
twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet.	 33.16046543783565
Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell,	 45.80303304882045
the cries of the auctioneer within. Four and nine. Those lovely	 62.389604880856695
curtains. Five shillings. Cosy curtains. Selling new at two guineas.	 258.4481999023039
Any advance on five shillings? Going for five shillings.	 93.10220787080623
The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it:	 43.28394682630008
—Barang!	 4.608171674364364
Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint.	 24.02717316358173
J. A. Jackson, W. E. Wylie, A. Munro and H. T. Gahan, their stretched	 70.9746583677387
necks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.	 69.65195273006736
Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams’s row.	 82.68577872744319
He halted near his daughter.	 65.03576276909114
—It’s time for you, she said.	 182.974738084297
—Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said. Are	 37.510965826999794
you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon	 96.42038239540416
shoulder? Melancholy God!	 403.36875115381287
Dilly shrugged her shoulders. Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and	 61.019953921242504
held them back.	 379.6565746412315
—Stand up straight, girl, he said. You’ll get curvature of the spine.	 43.33452565638112
Do you know what you look like?	 17.66245838697232
He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders	 91.34337840738333
and dropping his underjaw.	 52.6768019285736
—Give it up, father, Dilly said. All the people are looking at you.	 59.27463603732159
Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.	 62.85056328866797
—Did you get any money? Dilly asked.	 61.330188207555224
—Where would I get money? Mr Dedalus said. There is no-one in Dublin	 55.26874593122815
would lend me fourpence.	 104.95356848315147
—You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.	 35.15953971446605
—How do you know that? Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.	 22.571128054969627
Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along	 39.205628717205386
James’s street.	 51.821296290482664
—I know you did, Dilly answered. Were you in the Scotch house now?	 66.72554710029144
—I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling. Was it the little nuns	 59.17133758198896
taught you to be so saucy? Here.	 79.36188995860778
He handed her a shilling.	 91.06410824998564
—See if you can do anything with that, he said.	 28.002660106605113
—I suppose you got five, Dilly said. Give me more than that.	 44.11936379334246
—Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly. You’re like the rest of	 27.117887689632088
them, are you? An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor	 89.5987275846325
mother died. But wait awhile. You’ll all get a short shrift and a long	 122.21045036236625
day from me. Low blackguardism! I’m going to get rid of you. Wouldn’t	 44.31011152226357
care if I was stretched out stiff. He’s dead. The man upstairs is dead.	 89.7597596334361
He left her and walked on. Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.	 84.10643868665952
—Well, what is it? he said, stopping.	 32.72452921449794
The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.	 29.718315418587224
—Barang!	 4.608171674364364
—Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.	 49.71595975140844
The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell	 46.50022755508123
but feebly:	 64.59126249669593
—Bang!	 7730.261836041158
Mr Dedalus stared at him.	 23.933168654974615
—Watch him, he said. It’s instructive. I wonder will he allow us to	 63.94773221619174
talk.	 8314.750644029045
—You got more than that, father, Dilly said.	 46.71073683707136
—I’m going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said. I’ll leave you	 24.08535765850034
all where Jesus left the jews. Look, there’s all I have. I got two	 192.22568195433067
shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the	 43.85541346043548
funeral.	 10026.711604730363
He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.	 36.52965829093123
—Can’t you look for some money somewhere? Dilly said.	 67.50592855170945
Mr Dedalus thought and nodded.	 105.17234078272557
—I will, he said gravely. I looked all along the gutter in O’Connell	 100.25398098197785
street. I’ll try this one now.	 245.8665488174907
—You’re very funny, Dilly said, grinning.	 62.33277135194093
—Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies. Get a glass of milk	 62.057445009972945
for yourself and a bun or a something. I’ll be home shortly.	 92.58830855080073
He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.	 46.44352236713874
The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of	 22.337317823471853
Parkgate.	 4.608171674364364
—I’m sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.	 56.05507604135129
The lacquey banged loudly.	 121.02109325376149
Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing	 38.16274762917424
mincing mouth gently:	 168.87227625001358
—The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn’t do	 68.42571259958433
anything! O, sure they wouldn’t really! Is it little sister Monica!	 123.34169431191746
From the sundial towards James’s gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with	 86.57602998843056
the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James’s	 41.910508608434824
street, past Shackleton’s offices. Got round him all right. How do you	 73.11048136852159
do, Mr Crimmins? First rate, sir. I was afraid you might be up in your	 65.45819556465432
other establishment in Pimlico. How are things going? Just keeping	 81.83386810113456
alive. Lovely weather we’re having. Yes, indeed. Good for the country.	 162.2816714776472
Those farmers are always grumbling. I’ll just take a thimbleful of your	 65.21396192369075
best gin, Mr Crimmins. A small gin, sir. Yes, sir. Terrible affair that	 80.30436829314245
_General Slocum_ explosion. Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties.	 108.48729119403414
And heartrending scenes. Men trampling down women and children. Most	 100.44603954059289
brutal thing. What do they say was the cause? Spontaneous combustion.	 46.07542544196445
Most scandalous revelation. Not a single lifeboat would float and the	 36.773872691261225
firehose all burst. What I can’t understand is how the inspectors ever	 84.92286245720078
allowed a boat like that... Now, you’re talking straight, Mr Crimmins.	 104.53261364406391
You know why? Palm oil. Is that a fact? Without a doubt. Well now, look	 79.8249137256061
at that. And America they say is the land of the free. I thought we	 83.42231403503159
were bad here.	 470.8335490633552
I smiled at him. _America,_ I said quietly, just like that. _What is	 44.15987196484568
it? The sweepings of every country including our own. Isn’t that true?_	 76.28723774843952
That’s a fact.	 90.69333412501709
Graft, my dear sir. Well, of course, where there’s money going there’s	 109.99142350579885
always someone to pick it up.	 72.31913544037572
Saw him looking at my frockcoat. Dress does it. Nothing like a dressy	 146.63667804591498
appearance. Bowls them over.	 319.62281349646526
—Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?	 17.143831095191036
—Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.	 21.842467707515784
Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter	 64.54980320879278
Kennedy, hairdresser. Stylish coat, beyond a doubt. Scott of Dawson	 113.01986037020207
street. Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it. Never built	 101.38277479694105
under three guineas. Fits me down to the ground. Some Kildare street	 42.797280690009536
club toff had it probably. John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian	 62.17566200137444
bank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he	 66.1745216717641
remembered me.	 602.1623617110344
Aham! Must dress the character for those fellows. Knight of the road.	 85.95590751880688
Gentleman. And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom	 82.53988275053814
again, sir. The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying	 112.43499316509275
has it.	 255.2242708429211
North wall and sir John Rogerson’s quay, with hulls and anchorchains,	 45.61596306254904
sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on	 30.895265449527624
the ferrywash, Elijah is coming.	 34.018605828507255
Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image. High colour, of course.	 60.488137635446684
Grizzled moustache. Returned Indian officer. Bravely he bore his stumpy	 64.1561338569987
body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders. Is that Ned	 153.20137716833017
Lambert’s brother over the way, Sam? What? Yes. He’s as like it as damn	 183.76850604472557
it. No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there. Just a flash	 63.461603319813584
like that. Damn like him.	 148.3663371758676
Aham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath.	 21.64696592862219
Good drop of gin, that was. His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to	 45.92644118164415
his fat strut.	 57.96398199600395
Down there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered. Greasy black rope.	 96.38498072666552
Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant’s wife	 128.56076874051433
drove by in her noddy.	 126.28323585851724
Bad times those were. Well, well. Over and done with. Great topers too.	 155.24522512064547
Fourbottle men.	 78.80846740904828
Let me see. Is he buried in saint Michan’s? Or no, there was a midnight	 70.69352724010868
burial in Glasnevin. Corpse brought in through a secret door in the	 118.11578001360668
wall. Dignam is there now. Went out in a puff. Well, well. Better turn	 105.10989982961772
down here. Make a detour.	 81.5336326300918
Mr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street by the	 18.837039276004173
corner of Guinness’s visitors’ waitingroom. Outside the Dublin	 85.11750223092396
Distillers Company’s stores an outside car without fare or jarvey	 193.9562079649394
stood, the reins knotted to the wheel. Damn dangerous thing. Some	 96.57710774510298
Tipperary bosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens. Runaway	 13.807457858649789
horse.	 3587.0084130394384
Denis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John	 149.4271657124941
Henry Menton’s office, led his wife over O’Connell bridge, bound for	 47.699076415097586
the office of Messrs Collis and Ward.	 34.5440084593656
Mr Kernan approached Island street.	 37.00345869246027
Times of the troubles. Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those	 169.89918891471012
reminiscences of sir Jonah Barrington. When you look back on it all now	 61.07861322847842
in a kind of retrospective arrangement. Gaming at Daly’s. No	 35.026961954055054
cardsharping then. One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the	 37.707948008369414
table by a dagger. Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from	 113.78452218049951
major Sirr. Stables behind Moira house.	 618.4406091681616
Damn good gin that was.	 92.00429894056823
Fine dashing young nobleman. Good stock, of course. That ruffian, that	 76.24042529690684
sham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away. Course they were on	 53.706679751836624
the wrong side. They rose in dark and evil days. Fine poem that is:	 62.74127288565826
Ingram. They were gentlemen. Ben Dollard does sing that ballad	 40.43208075794517
touchingly. Masterly rendition.	 4.206040932916629
_At the siege of Ross did my father fall._	 53.133255760066284
A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping,	 166.13309445167846
leaping in their, in their saddles. Frockcoats. Cream sunshades.	 107.84212123170934
Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.	 61.556844399193174
His Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair. Damn it! What a	 116.7543808046441
pity!	 3099.723852556669
Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary’s	 30.214412749765877
fingers prove a timedulled chain. Dust webbed the window and the	 60.43879098751726
showtrays. Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails.	 93.60006187722286
Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on	 70.33292155095428
rubies, leprous and winedark stones.	 18.456964964744007
Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights	 91.27954344569306
shining in the darkness. Where fallen archangels flung the stars of	 130.79689706020304
their brows. Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest	 15.388608004045686
them.	 436.51515115481243
She dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic. A sailorman,	 34.45216699949809
rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her. A long and seafed	 51.48383395738845
silent rut. She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her	 80.72183240714031
hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.	 99.1624416383006
Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned	 58.757442815475734
it and held it at the point of his Moses’ beard. Grandfather ape	 63.83924541972956
gloating on a stolen hoard.	 9.740013295094453
And you who wrest old images from the burial earth? The brainsick words	 143.31905267689228
of sophists: Antisthenes. A lore of drugs. Orient and immortal wheat	 21.82034734630087
standing from everlasting to everlasting.	 153.54513202891178
Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through	 54.83847835840728
Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella,	 43.45662525781401
one with a midwife’s bag in which eleven cockles rolled.	 29.345220324419273
The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the	 11.077336292949308
powerhouse urged Stephen to be on. Beingless beings. Stop! Throb always	 73.3848842846577
without you and the throb always within. Your heart you sing of. I	 169.96765770194773
between them. Where? Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I.	 107.11179589990752
Shatter them, one and both. But stun myself too in the blow. Shatter me	 113.67407016213326
you who can. Bawd and butcher were the words. I say! Not yet awhile. A	 62.823403304805936
look around.	 183.2932913266824
Yes, quite true. Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time. You	 169.82652173849334
say right, sir. A Monday morning, ’twas so, indeed.	 198.06677101174185
Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against	 84.7935522001529
his shoulderblade. In Clohissey’s window a faded 1860 print of Heenan	 50.71794431084712
boxing Sayers held his eye. Staring backers with square hats stood	 74.70491199736477
round the roped prizering. The heavyweights in tight loincloths	 22.894084356744724
proposed gently each to other his bulbous fists. And they are	 69.08135431636931
throbbing: heroes’ hearts.	 38.71440343040397
He turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.	 30.35018942316305
—Twopence each, the huckster said. Four for sixpence.	 202.17111045757335
Tattered pages. _The Irish Beekeeper. Life and Miracles of the Curé of	 26.591068241170696
Ars. Pocket Guide to Killarney._	 158.15241167007704
I might find here one of my pawned schoolprizes. _Stephano Dedalo,	 31.995770362367196
alumno optimo, palmam ferenti._	 4.045570071155129
Father Conmee, having read his little hours, walked through the hamlet	 48.39437665499066
of Donnycarney, murmuring vespers.	 58.27221974296791
Binding too good probably. What is this? Eighth and ninth book of	 47.215081475322854
Moses. Secret of all secrets. Seal of King David. Thumbed pages: read	 156.75317012653719
and read. Who has passed here before me? How to soften chapped hands.	 82.27180137464879
Recipe for white wine vinegar. How to win a woman’s love. For me this.	 78.90923295740023
Say the following talisman three times with hands folded:	 163.36693428792216
—_Se el yilo nebrakada femininum! Amor me solo! Sanktus! Amen._	 38.23994331692054
Who wrote this? Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbot Peter	 51.4978636383413
Salanka to all true believers divulged. As good as any other abbot’s	 32.899062687551364
charms, as mumbling Joachim’s. Down, baldynoddle, or we’ll wool your	 26.96613446133123
wool.	 15307.932872242944
—What are you doing here, Stephen?	 43.192523150755314
Dilly’s high shoulders and shabby dress.	 88.41582191817467
Shut the book quick. Don’t let see.	 267.9178234714613
—What are you doing? Stephen said.	 21.333163124222562
A Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides. It	 87.58871936939308
glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots. I told her	 74.30955132541753
of Paris. Late lieabed under a quilt of old overcoats, fingering a	 33.17944808255625
pinchbeck bracelet, Dan Kelly’s token. _Nebrakada femininum._	 11.198983896835388
—What have you there? Stephen asked.	 60.97451439280031
—I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing	 36.62887453016725
nervously. Is it any good?	 135.18729978758716
My eyes they say she has. Do others see me so? Quick, far and daring.	 58.43627965525847
Shadow of my mind.	 99.17496144299307
He took the coverless book from her hand. Chardenal’s French primer.	 33.9966809913657
—What did you buy that for? he asked. To learn French?	 54.236876994066236
She nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.	 176.98763095436996
Show no surprise. Quite natural.	 856.9138449832585
—Here, Stephen said. It’s all right. Mind Maggy doesn’t pawn it on you.	 61.30363280611287
I suppose all my books are gone.	 109.42495401149633
—Some, Dilly said. We had to.	 32.72563297794696
She is drowning. Agenbite. Save her. Agenbite. All against us. She will	 151.49365253343709
drown me with her, eyes and hair. Lank coils of seaweed hair around me,	 57.16014272248532
my heart, my soul. Salt green death.	 297.80915049284016
We.	 392.587246987247
Agenbite of inwit. Inwit’s agenbite.	 88.61040389809018
Misery! Misery!	 1184.9346754198655
—Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?	 17.143831095191036
—Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.	 21.842467707515784
They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter’s. Father Cowley	 68.99183900225142
brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.	 48.52174769286763
—What’s the best news? Mr Dedalus said.	 22.691320922804337
—Why then not much, Father Cowley said. I’m barricaded up, Simon, with	 96.10774057344884
two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.	 81.77411682071748
—Jolly, Mr Dedalus said. Who is it?	 40.25161736048529
—O, Father Cowley said. A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.	 28.53336580274061
—With a broken back, is it? Mr Dedalus asked.	 55.743690109296075
—The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered. Reuben of that ilk. I’m just	 51.30176668751345
waiting for Ben Dollard. He’s going to say a word to long John to get	 51.13180471444072
him to take those two men off. All I want is a little time.	 108.47228748713017
He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in	 74.39405877651534
his neck.	 168.3299823508688
—I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Poor old bockedy Ben! He’s always	 37.05238604880351
doing a good turn for someone. Hold hard!	 161.21561961019418
He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.	 39.31677174907984
—There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.	 63.48071968672965
Ben Dollard’s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops	 122.80077951166223
crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge. He came towards	 73.64189830146067
them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.	 30.360563814352908
As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:	 43.106135855426785
—Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.	 65.43282122191924
—Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.	 30.72301621189399
Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben	 98.3312079490606
Dollard’s figure. Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he	 116.76175433122175
muttered sneeringly:	 4.411654744205047
—That’s a pretty garment, isn’t it, for a summer’s day?	 41.318100831647726
—Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I	 95.01407622693054
threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.	 245.09858952619047
He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes	 53.99023782862293
from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:	 88.35485555920667
—They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.	 92.67603119755427
—Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said. Thanks be to	 36.32630369696033
God he’s not paid yet.	 183.67069112838007
—And how is that _basso profondo_, Benjamin? Father Cowley asked.	 21.31432326805873
Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring,	 5.430940074915271
glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.	 32.577232128734515
Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter’s mouth, gave forth	 112.91624935085215
a deep note.	 94.03525602017969
—Aw! he said.	 19.165321086926493
—That’s the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.	 47.27582088737422
—What about that? Ben Dollard said. Not too dusty? What?	 39.794934691136746
He turned to both.	 86.41641154187698
—That’ll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.	 61.05315344484081
The reverend Hugh C. Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint	 19.24594724049448
Mary’s abbey past James and Charles Kennedy’s, rectifiers, attended by	 122.34735962032518
Geraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of	 20.11403129704436
hurdles.	 4.608171674364364
Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward,	 75.48337379328996
his joyful fingers in the air.	 25.67868310292075
—Come along with me to the subsheriff’s office, he said. I want to show	 30.009158237736685
you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff. He’s a cross between	 172.23821205736573
Lobengula and Lynchehaun. He’s well worth seeing, mind you. Come along.	 35.702524356527846
I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will	 42.096745530886864
cost me a fall if I don’t... Wait awhile... We’re on the right lay,	 105.07542899319236
Bob, believe you me.	 572.0082094454011
—For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.	 36.763690391955485
Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button	 75.6731278788213
of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the	 35.56963910791158
heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.	 67.24504229466599
—What few days? he boomed. Hasn’t your landlord distrained for rent?	 104.4396526984396
—He has, Father Cowley said.	 27.917154308324406
—Then our friend’s writ is not worth the paper it’s printed on, Ben	 146.191767459831
Dollard said. The landlord has the prior claim. I gave him all the	 48.34451448085683
particulars. 29 Windsor avenue. Love is the name?	 130.75543430861183
—That’s right, Father Cowley said. The reverend Mr Love. He’s a	 79.04880440967126
minister in the country somewhere. But are you sure of that?	 60.494476508012184
—You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that	 43.54342044434342
writ where Jacko put the nuts.	 488.24930392685116
He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.	 50.969583360360964
—Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his	 24.559374394887413
glasses on his coatfront, following them.	 141.11972690637705
—The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they	 14.435848782588625
passed out of the Castleyard gate.	 40.624743523083154
The policeman touched his forehead.	 111.27660945333619
—God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.	 21.460402846838466
He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on	 49.01809399405155
towards Lord Edward street.	 381.1292157534748
Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy’s head by Miss Douce’s head, appeared	 12.332455315932092
above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.	 39.378369304267096
—Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard. I wrote to Father	 57.993336581207785
Conmee and laid the whole case before him.	 85.15295201082368
—You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.	 90.15592611449577
—Boyd? Martin Cunningham said shortly. Touch me not.	 30.593006577000065
John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them	 75.89683780842218
quickly down Cork hill.	 515.4315022938574
On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed	 26.777744454217732
Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.	 102.60675713709004
The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.	 57.48065908139186
—Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the _Mail_	 68.85118324945607
office. I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.	 156.1522931644613
—Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list. And put down the	 24.203911345933708
five shillings too.	 48.709038402255906
—Without a second word either, Mr Power said.	 92.82768315579855
—Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.	 121.77648345089659
John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.	 28.967824355277408
—I’ll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.	 78.39274872081855
They went down Parliament street.	 24.049489342215406
—There’s Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh’s.	 46.58522441695533
—Righto, Martin Cunningham said. Here goes.	 27.469011443599527
Outside _la Maison Claire_ Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney’s	 81.48030453882818
brother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.	 71.32323654960038
John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took	 54.898746255417244
the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked	 47.828069996901405
uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson’s watches.	 109.71371240374866
—The assistant town clerk’s corns are giving him some trouble, John	 97.48247706973162
Wyse Nolan told Mr Power.	 61.021653220537296
They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh’s winerooms. The	 60.16539262281887
empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate. Martin Cunningham,	 84.60677272503561
speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not	 371.17261311658154
glance.	 6584.8527050564335
—And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as	 25.053188948455343
life.	 1040.235324093293
The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.	 43.11027052972342
—Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and	 29.817416487785287
greeted.	 22234.838907737576
Long John Fanning made no way for them. He removed his large Henry Clay	 118.04865055773917
decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all	 32.282455595375495
their faces.	 141.2757120318731
—Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations? he	 36.40162265667689
said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.	 29.928002914083184
Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly,	 93.92188586455839
about their damned Irish language. Where was the marshal, he wanted to	 73.23700955076261
know, to keep order in the council chamber. And old Barlow the	 74.25526427068463
macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order,	 67.28672070049944
no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little	 48.49142922407877
Lorcan Sherlock doing _locum tenens_ for him. Damned Irish language,	 48.598515769921036
language of our forefathers.	 43.11910561759042
Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.	 47.9139192862785
Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to	 46.33268094271407
the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held	 36.04275391020791
his peace.	 146.28047872939618
—What Dignam was that? long John Fanning asked.	 31.40911848373328
Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.	 57.38675600618102
—O, my corns! he said plaintively. Come upstairs for goodness’ sake	 31.346706763267587
till I sit down somewhere. Uff! Ooo! Mind!	 92.89293648471882
Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning’s flank and	 51.35704529631842
passed in and up the stairs.	 249.6883196933454
—Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff. I don’t think	 27.42375306095
you knew him or perhaps you did, though.	 232.47595252032872
With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.	 31.077201860805612
—Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long	 52.091494317370085
John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.	 37.63884619787469
—Rather lowsized. Dignam of Menton’s office that was, Martin Cunningham	 87.73834446408446
said.	 674.7359038427248
Long John Fanning could not remember him.	 24.301819499317418
Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.	 12.444117955086814
—What’s that? Martin Cunningham said.	 18.43122624440793
All turned where they stood. John Wyse Nolan came down again. From the	 75.60180848498682
cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street,	 56.32352743438107
harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering. Gaily they went	 35.935455311441316
past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly. In saddles of the	 117.59252843335388
leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders.	 75.20264342502533
—What was it? Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the	 29.457115010662932
staircase.	 6667.29052386655
—The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse	 33.3576124966176
Nolan answered from the stairfoot.	 44.336657709000875
As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his	 40.66206181723893
Panama to Haines:	 375.8322340349585
—Parnell’s brother. There in the corner.	 82.43327775004006
They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man	 74.13101247906307
whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.	 44.13999453238332
—Is that he? Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.	 88.30034361491482
—Yes, Mulligan said. That’s John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.	 149.33915608422848
John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw	 36.38622523735871
went up again to his forehead whereat it rested. An instant after,	 65.32778947415599
under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and	 55.80523803175492
fell once more upon a working corner.	 332.65859959706836
—I’ll take a _mélange,_ Haines said to the waitress.	 22.244685448752143
—Two _mélanges,_ Buck Mulligan said. And bring us some scones and	 46.4071804889401
butter and some cakes as well.	 193.7621252438269
When she had gone he said, laughing:	 43.37334363324521
—We call it D.B.C. because they have damn bad cakes. O, but you missed	 97.14935048654874
Dedalus on _Hamlet._	 502.31023986729844
Haines opened his newbought book.	 63.50278967090224
—I’m sorry, he said. Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all	 38.55321029597502
minds that have lost their balance.	 191.80803549934646
The onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 Nelson street:	 62.04147060232839
—_England expects_...	 166.21218047991277
Buck Mulligan’s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.	 49.297339520074814
—You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance.	 78.26342808000041
Wandering Ængus I call him.	 98.39028460078708
—I am sure he has an _idée fixe,_ Haines said, pinching his chin	 40.670129183885365
thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger. Now I am speculating what it	 91.5875738704933
would be likely to be. Such persons always have.	 102.0493427326104
Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.	 16.50865680134664
—They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell. He will never	 64.68324841056798
capture the Attic note. The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white	 47.15388086822703
death and the ruddy birth. That is his tragedy. He can never be a poet.	 63.2709756348348
The joy of creation...	 116.82231766530538
—Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly. I see. I tackled him	 54.03757348667719
this morning on belief. There was something on his mind, I saw. It’s	 74.74188796161536
rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an	 140.00724428969338
interesting point out of that.	 85.87697484364364
Buck Mulligan’s watchful eyes saw the waitress come. He helped her to	 53.144528794509114
unload her tray.	 55.31316176831047
—He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid	 53.12142236977198
the cheerful cups. The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny,	 63.28499206276245
of retribution. Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea.	 103.56004927263058
Does he write anything for your movement?	 139.4908989017544
He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream.	 42.56011835963091
Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over	 40.747953218666105
its smoking pith. He bit off a soft piece hungrily.	 97.95893463765394
—Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing. He is going to write	 53.604996705737065
something in ten years.	 137.54872555147765
—Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon.	 89.56272525941372
Still, I shouldn’t wonder if he did after all.	 72.28739683886822
He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.	 22.264029825314644
—This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance. I don’t	 76.2441610375959
want to be imposed on.	 20.82711128740798
Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of	 36.359472156631725
ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping	 32.34551276124026
street past Benson’s ferry, and by the threemasted schooner _Rosevean_	 13.162689392441267
from Bridgwater with bricks.	 34.25117714855206
Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell’s yard. Behind	 79.78848567730547
him Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with	 6.243470837500749
stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith’s	 64.773599172715
house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square. Distantly behind him	 59.134841144429565
a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.	 24.362672810100058
Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr	 15.647621378429678
Lewis Werner’s cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along	 82.2164477315642
Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.	 73.89931160099827
At the corner of Wilde’s house he halted, frowned at Elijah’s name	 70.75281815635208
announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of	 38.075533961039746
duke’s lawn. His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun. With ratsteeth	 45.36183406665307
bared he muttered:	 211.31500141673956
—_Coactus volui._	 4.411654744205047
He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.	 77.29941587433812
As he strode past Mr Bloom’s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat	 31.213367369693806
brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards,	 62.35551815295873
having buffeted a thewless body. The blind stripling turned his sickly	 50.31205083006368
face after the striding form.	 118.02301211801588
—God’s curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You’re blinder	 32.157929244520545
nor I am, you bitch’s bastard!	 161.0678025647419
Opposite Ruggy O’Donohoe’s Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the	 20.868893205282447
pound and a half of Mangan’s, late Fehrenbach’s, porksteaks he had been	 37.46929700888809
sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling. It was too blooming	 131.52863777715984
dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs	 58.77039752782126
MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping	 65.20129886161435
sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney’s.	 44.73194203692534
And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole	 23.66692341314878
blooming time and sighing.	 478.07651881000885
After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner,	 36.814248662152536
stopped him. He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their	 74.89267375662654
pelts and putting up their props. From the sidemirrors two mourning	 26.994281844282987
Masters Dignam gaped silently. Myler Keogh, Dublin’s pet lamb, will	 53.20913982579764
meet sergeantmajor Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of	 44.73560435334478
fifty sovereigns. Gob, that’d be a good pucking match to see. Myler	 87.02283624833014
Keogh, that’s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash. Two bar	 64.73746892114207
entrance, soldiers half price. I could easy do a bunk on ma. Master	 141.17322166501884
Dignam on his left turned as he turned. That’s me in mourning. When is	 134.7400081742862
it? May the twentysecond. Sure, the blooming thing is all over. He	 106.82985352464459
turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap	 56.966280401551465
awry, his collar sticking up. Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he	 40.680446328383574
saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two	 42.36310994292784
puckers. One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer	 19.630243194291072
smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found	 82.8352355533818
out.	 536.8554774050247
Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on. The best pucker going	 72.54943557657052
for strength was Fitzsimons. One puck in the wind from that fellow	 53.54076346323438
would knock you into the middle of next week, man. But the best pucker	 82.8522015090568
for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out	 73.4661809802139
of him, dodging and all.	 44.084168080045266
In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff’s mouth and	 42.94627165128602
a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was	 55.44999951443844
telling him and grinning all the time.	 49.13297091550241
No Sandymount tram.	 122.5020468908656
Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his	 29.641183826531808
other hand. His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down. The	 56.6587873198747
blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming	 47.01251101832353
end to it. He met schoolboys with satchels. I’m not going tomorrow	 82.33352791287233
either, stay away till Monday. He met other schoolboys. Do they notice	 140.52670926673693
I’m in mourning? Uncle Barney said he’d get it into the paper tonight.	 36.3183513269009
Then they’ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa’s	 54.89228836852286
name.	 1099.0983667900869
His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a	 95.48197884438909
fly walking over it up to his eye. The scrunch that was when they were	 44.44860956700437
screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were	 20.773810272655297
bringing it downstairs.	 206.6052054245158
Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling	 131.709816898062
the men how to get it round the bend. A big coffin it was, and high and	 86.75868590108644
heavylooking. How was that? The last night pa was boosed he was	 56.59535330721162
standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to	 72.0931082559907
Tunney’s for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt.	 78.65763860114883
Never see him again. Death, that is. Pa is dead. My father is dead. He	 124.41731514243486
told me to be a good son to ma. I couldn’t hear the other things he	 41.60339940991744
said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better. Poor	 68.539881555183
pa. That was Mr Dignam, my father. I hope he’s in purgatory now because	 106.55289208956906
he went to confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night.	 85.35938556599913
William Humble, earl of Dudley, and lady Dudley, accompanied by	 53.75487818013204
lieutenantcolonel Heseltine, drove out after luncheon from the	 27.612934734480767
viceregal lodge. In the following carriage were the honourable Mrs	 150.65457384864334
Paget, Miss de Courcy and the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. in	 38.53742750870057
attendance.	 8047.703469380609
The cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by	 34.46879695330195
obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern	 15.312583332829975
quays. The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the	 38.01091563450427
metropolis. At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted	 61.353184032489374
him vainly from afar. Between Queen’s and Whitworth bridges lord	 55.281073396794305
Dudley’s viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley	 67.1491595734802
White, B. L., M. A., who stood on Arran quay outside Mrs M. E. White’s,	 128.3569438688369
the pawnbroker’s, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose	 22.98220833918767
with his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough	 66.80998912066363
more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot	 124.72715122891185
through Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus. In the	 20.83870673090107
porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding,	 47.48103611251079
Collis and Ward saw him with surprise. Past Richmond bridge at the	 88.17798946537086
doorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the	 43.33826696969652
Patriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed	 200.6714028430047
her plan and retracing her steps by King’s windows smiled credulously	 53.63112721428986
on the representative of His Majesty. From its sluice in Wood quay wall	 27.93715459448801
under Tom Devan’s office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of	 121.20185559403961
liquid sewage. Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel, gold by	 49.878095376545126
bronze, Miss Kennedy’s head by Miss Douce’s head watched and admired.	 37.21648993148607
On Ormond quay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhouse	 32.156470450741544
for the subsheriff’s office, stood still in midstreet and brought his	 43.4121260552124
hat low. His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus’ greeting. From	 96.99995863628662
Cahill’s corner the reverend Hugh C. Love, M. A., made obeisance	 48.97562322002666
unperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held	 73.71512787068734
of yore rich advowsons. On Grattan bridge Lenehan and M’Coy, taking	 89.23762065254512
leave of each other, watched the carriages go by. Passing by Roger	 219.03070703736176
Greene’s office and Dollard’s big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell,	 98.52659477072481
carrying the Catesby’s cork lino letters for her father who was laid	 113.00425160247991
up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she	 113.97478982461291
couldn’t see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring’s	 103.84817259386212
big yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its	 114.209565592395
being the lord lieutenant. Beyond Lundy Foot’s from the shaded door of	 48.19691751121171
Kavanagh’s winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness	 14.821083987381666
towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland. The	 36.04463879757961
Right Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, G. C. V. O., passed	 80.9677932504886
Micky Anderson’s all times ticking watches and Henry and James’s wax	 94.3232665661311
smartsuited freshcheeked models, the gentleman Henry, _dernier cri_	 24.25133002324143
James. Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the	 121.51002433300053
approach of the cavalcade. Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley	 78.4392570702071
fixed on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret	 66.60914955422031
waistcoat and doffed his cap to her. A charming _soubrette,_ great	 102.7153021667103
Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from	 41.603090941062796
her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon	 127.73287078807925
lieutenantcolonel H. G. Heseltine, and also upon the honourable Gerald	 43.21609000053993
Ward A. D. C. From the window of the D. B. C. Buck Mulligan gaily, and	 33.53061626833429
Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders	 62.23488549481564
of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon	 45.13947866037973
John Howard Parnell looked intently. In Fownes’s street Dilly Dedalus,	 28.928067431525538
straining her sight upward from Chardenal’s first French primer, saw	 93.38923963605171
sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the glare. John Henry	 10.663397824919386
Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from	 75.19313165320405
winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not looked at in	 211.14838396641787
his fat left hand not feeling it. Where the foreleg of King Billy’s	 105.41767719597036
horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from	 62.613778392785065
under the hoofs of the outriders. She shouted in his ear the tidings.	 32.35156024289896
Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast and saluted the	 47.199687565259985
second carriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C., agreeably	 41.99866911556757
surprised, made haste to reply. At Ponsonby’s corner a jaded white	 128.1383767239484
flagon H. halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind him,	 80.70168569785295
E.L.Y.’S, while outriders pranced past and carriages. Opposite Pigott’s	 76.36802203376345
music warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, gaily	 46.67636245767436
apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved. By	 39.029395044026955
the provost’s wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes	 34.02717457420119

suit of indigo serge. His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to salute	 55.315935196453765
but he offered to the three ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and	 33.17752802665533
the red flower between his lips. As they drove along Nassau street His	 36.17633162018305
Excellency drew the attention of his bowing consort to the programme of	 70.05445029342654
music which was being discoursed in College park. Unseen brazen	 53.90267557832836

Deep in Leinster street by Trinity’s postern a loyal king’s man,	 48.87970840351626

Merrion square Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, waiting, saw salutes	 36.86207494165569

cap with fingers greased by porksteak paper. His collar too sprang up.	 121.08541727334841
The viceroy, on his way to inaugurate the Mirus bazaar in aid of funds	 26.4350773114344
for Mercer’s hospital, drove with his following towards Lower Mount	 117.44378415946159
street. He passed a blind stripling opposite Broadbent’s. In Lower	 84.73258222515942
Mount street a pedestrian in a brown macintosh, eating dry bread,	 64.20210895970887
passed swiftly and unscathed across the viceroy’s path. At the Royal	 53.94275629927481

Bronze by gold, miss Douce’s head by miss Kennedy’s head, over the	 11.773007027227695
crossblind of the Ormond bar heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing	 124.08746628415682
steel.	 15886.29394144335
—Is that her? asked miss Kennedy.	 133.34227472337287
Miss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and _eau de Nil._	 29.93875434720195
—Exquisite contrast, miss Kennedy said.	 39.282480577819264
When all agog miss Douce said eagerly:	 50.053316284105236
—Look at the fellow in the tall silk.	 51.175587647557
—Who? Where? gold asked more eagerly.	 398.5966313015821
—In the second carriage, miss Douce’s wet lips said, laughing in the	 47.83638074299996
sun.	 4641.90313641571
He’s looking. Mind till I see.	 168.38833061298286
She darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against	 65.8098942953946
the pane in a halo of hurried breath.	 27.756720330221178
Her wet lips tittered:	 69.01110547502336
—He’s killed looking back.	 81.02282384286731
She laughed:	 278.67791665297125
—O wept! Aren’t men frightful idiots?	 10.478160292662645
With sadness.	 28.492587109789124
Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair	 103.68493154081807
behind an ear. Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a	 124.50401407497894
hair. Sadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.	 74.626929387727
—It’s them has the fine times, sadly then she said.	 160.56396401597004
A man.	 60.12577757613959
Bloowho went by by Moulang’s pipes bearing in his breast the sweets of	 45.83476743803875
sin, by Wine’s antiques, in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by	 78.92237803911993
Carroll’s dusky battered plate, for Raoul.	 76.25881477427849
The boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came. For them	 121.15791422660507
unheeding him he banged on the counter his tray of chattering china.	 25.699853086022188
And	 42.26742598371171
—There’s your teas, he said.	 42.650577926436796
Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned	 37.51615065863635
lithia crate, safe from eyes, low.	 170.1065284609475
—What is it? loud boots unmannerly asked.	 90.86229192118016
—Find out, miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.	 33.02257775548672
—Your _beau,_ is it?	 57.772278281085754
A haughty bronze replied:	 172.17606569395355
—I’ll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your	 64.5876895595448
impertinent insolence.	 4.411654744205047
—Imperthnthn thnthnthn, bootssnout sniffed rudely, as he retreated as	 22.868770516554555
she threatened as he had come.	 40.94498322106276
Bloom.	 75.63006035870652
On her flower frowning miss Douce said:	 29.908205759528006
—Most aggravating that young brat is. If he doesn’t conduct himself	 78.86452702990185
I’ll wring his ear for him a yard long.	 69.12648313723983
Ladylike in exquisite contrast.	 190.3892171753955
—Take no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined.	 59.00932935086506
She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea. They cowered	 67.1843555064602
under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned,	 97.66000253675469
waiting for their teas to draw. They pawed their blouses, both of black	 65.71400281843606
satin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and	 82.0152490300423
seven.	 2611.785488076569
Yes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear,	 33.484848016205696
hoofs ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.	 44.90402386395624
—Am I awfully sunburnt?	 72.27421310745103
Miss bronze unbloused her neck.	 113.84779313513664
—No, said miss Kennedy. It gets brown after. Did you try the borax with	 150.20847652548392
the cherry laurel water?	 32.64976113152847
Miss Douce halfstood to see her skin askance in the barmirror	 18.815112694194774
gildedlettered where hock and claret glasses shimmered and in their	 29.738096142749356
midst a shell.	 517.3190387674927
—And leave it to my hands, she said.	 91.04236372529479
—Try it with the glycerine, miss Kennedy advised.	 62.93697374390557
Bidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce	 66.74190218145013
—Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated. I asked that	 91.43654975230314
old fogey in Boyd’s for something for my skin.	 69.83842622232103
Miss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed:	 117.33195454136053
—O, don’t remind me of him for mercy’ sake!	 26.834696124056713
—But wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated.	 16.627382884719598
Sweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears	 148.99374246006292
with little fingers.	 120.84773431341593
—No, don’t, she cried.	 212.10330377957843
—I won’t listen, she cried.	 163.59369634250623
But Bloom?	 296.75323333940906
Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey’s tone:	 23.303181164570326
—For your what? says he.	 112.2962550079681
Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed	 81.71966767358906
again:	 1025.9873088345048
—Don’t let me think of him or I’ll expire. The hideous old wretch! That	 30.793194858032727
night in the Antient Concert Rooms.	 31.611845375694564
She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.	 46.27147443613418
—Here he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters,	 78.51930404262595
ruffling her nosewings. Hufa! Hufa!	 10.637242089448
Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy’s throat. Miss Douce	 59.11427920946397
huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a	 29.243145923390156
snout in quest.	 146.41084222564228
—O! shrieking, miss Kennedy cried. Will you ever forget his goggle eye?	 52.700617031085315
Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting:	 89.26491246601768
—And your other eye!	 90.87744704722296
Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner’s name. Why do I always think	 98.14949524446024
Figather? Gathering figs, I think. And Prosper Loré’s huguenot name. By	 65.12162122875655
Bassi’s blessed virgins Bloom’s dark eyes went by. Bluerobed, white	 99.44770782963005
under, come to me. God they believe she is: or goddess. Those today. I	 160.7233212457838
could not see. That fellow spoke. A student. After with Dedalus’ son.	 160.93647651261398
He might be Mulligan. All comely virgins. That brings those rakes of	 102.64987888255101
fellows in: her white.	 198.7037243770879
By went his eyes. The sweets of sin. Sweet are the sweets.	 140.20918652617848
Of sin.	 175.31012888594535
In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy	 89.62977018603046
your other eye. They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let	 163.33784578987283
freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other,	 47.74330349981013
high piercing notes.	 420.18357458751325
Ah, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down.	 86.78843548789207
Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and	 45.10153590730145
gigglegiggled. Miss Douce, bending over the teatray, ruffled again her	 29.18713931723556
nose and rolled droll fattened eyes. Again Kennygiggles, stooping, her	 87.1648080202302
fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed,	 76.93795693814937
spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter,	 47.1776099994613
coughing with choking, crying:	 234.78505848150843
—O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried.	 51.54974049520511
With his bit of beard!	 112.4876216388948
Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman,	 135.8362214827879
delight, joy, indignation.	 382.5290687030575
—Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.	 110.04589871826887
Shrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each	 257.40891945017125
each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze,	 51.12179955419738
shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter. And then laughed more. Greasy I	 89.98910754088028
knows. Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and	 84.4652891815654
pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge. All flushed (O!),	 52.64259752805664
panting, sweating (O!), all breathless.	 215.33021695577048
Married to Bloom, to greaseabloom.	 75.12781676820552
—O saints above! miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose. I	 35.79005368258786
wished I hadn’t laughed so much. I feel all wet.	 110.75643164321234
—O, miss Douce! miss Kennedy protested. You horrid thing!	 63.83141256120811
And flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.	 99.45274549086419
By Cantwell’s offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi’s virgins, bright of	 101.5848395257648
their oils. Nannetti’s father hawked those things about, wheedling at	 60.99220270317079
doors as I. Religion pays. Must see him for that par. Eat first. I	 89.13488212622015
want. Not yet. At four, she said. Time ever passing. Clockhands	 228.47489248884227
turning. On. Where eat? The Clarence, Dolphin. On. For Raoul. Eat. If I	 78.56807361967553
net five guineas with those ads. The violet silk petticoats. Not yet.	 74.06022313343657
The sweets of sin.	 27.338313079867063
Flushed less, still less, goldenly paled.	 53.47274240401238
Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus. Chips, picking chips off one of his	 40.5525494208827
rocky thumbnails. Chips. He strolled.	 65.99042668275436
—O, welcome back, miss Douce.	 50.01395587843116
He held her hand. Enjoyed her holidays?	 26.280443277907203
—Tiptop.	 9668.137355001456
He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.	 60.914989333602264
—Gorgeous, she said. Look at the holy show I am. Lying out on the	 40.60347827874365
strand all day.	 405.26400852080764
Bronze whiteness.	 89.88361233531307
—That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed	 89.01716639577138
her hand indulgently. Tempting poor simple males.	 84.8058101099434
Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away.	 84.75819305790255
—O go away! she said. You’re very simple, I don’t think.	 41.94772769929078
He was.	 31.665829013133308
—Well now I am, he mused. I looked so simple in the cradle they	 58.13842896348509
christened me simple Simon.	 124.34828840748884
—You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer. And what did the	 32.866323238995726
doctor order today?	 1050.582741887176
—Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself. I think I’ll trouble	 51.309448910192486
you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.	 65.96869088901217
Jingle.	 1782.5644142026433
—With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.	 47.83555004139878
With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane’s	 25.754091121569573
she turned herself. With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from	 70.08569650570868
her crystal keg. Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought	 62.294278180645335
pouch and pipe. Alacrity she served. He blew through the flue two husky	 52.51075197729309
fifenotes.	 4.608171674364364
—By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains. Must be	 39.66958009163961
a great tonic in the air down there. But a long threatening comes at	 63.371030417271314
last, they say. Yes. Yes.	 104.71594704510687
Yes. He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid’s, into	 51.00595298657435
the bowl. Chips. Shreds. Musing. Mute.	 103.56641246361714
None nought said nothing. Yes.	 439.53870656191975
Gaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling:	 115.14514291723754
—_O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas!_	 47.74857157271303
—Was Mr Lidwell in today?	 179.20216379066522
In came Lenehan. Round him peered Lenehan. Mr Bloom reached Essex	 159.2910303212324
bridge. Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex. To Martha I must write.	 82.12935894145356
Buy paper. Daly’s. Girl there civil. Bloom. Old Bloom. Blue bloom is on	 329.10499148095056
the rye.	 7.77559996992721
—He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.	 37.60786481664446
Lenehan came forward.	 74.81459896028645
—Was Mr Boylan looking for me?	 49.83455945320071
He asked. She answered:	 171.29173610358902
—Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?	 109.51107288358918
She asked. Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her	 114.57526017771889
gaze upon a page:	 450.27947279153886
—No. He was not.	 74.22477697514611
Miss gaze of Kennedy, heard, not seen, read on. Lenehan round the	 227.56875054518898
sandwichbell wound his round body round.	 210.45857014499333
—Peep! Who’s in the corner?	 66.89933201050688
No glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures. To mind her	 113.24395613331194
stops. To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess.	 291.455401710758
Jingle jaunty jingle.	 739.8217111122013
Girlgold she read and did not glance. Take no notice. She took no	 109.08052631522021
notice while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly:	 45.380232006931074
—Ah fox met ah stork. Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your	 146.73123622028982
bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?	 105.47973725208224
He droned in vain. Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.	 40.58130952964241
He sighed aside:	 82.3491546450746
—Ah me! O my!	 183.3838928110878
He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.	 113.11990337466771
—Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.	 55.892247349232974
—Who may he be? Mr Dedalus asked.	 61.758547390331074
Lenehan opened most genial arms. Who?	 253.58670196162555
—Who may he be? he asked. Can you ask? Stephen, the youthful bard.	 218.41827718748732
Dry.	 22826.42286054426
Mr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.	 121.2403283571908
—I see, he said. I didn’t recognise him for the moment. I hear he is	 39.77602011051602
keeping very select company. Have you seen him lately?	 110.49246001482608
He had.	 33.35714648781133
—I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan. In	 59.82648051903672
Mooney’s _en ville_ and in Mooney’s _sur mer._ He had received the	 37.36417067533677
rhino for the labour of his muse.	 22.066059476075502
He smiled at bronze’s teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes:	 67.36889721513064
—The _élite_ of Erin hung upon his lips. The ponderous pundit, Hugh	 23.534790728321475
MacHugh, Dublin’s most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel	 74.33622052801434
boy of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of	 58.87324796907802
the O’Madden Burke.	 56.98262848740671
After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and	 26.257378818896186
—That must have been highly diverting, said he. I see.	 34.01655078825735
He see. He drank. With faraway mourning mountain eye. Set down his	 115.72781579983528
glass.	 10983.167470205814
He looked towards the saloon door.	 36.07240555972555
—I see you have moved the piano.	 44.91877064280177
—The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking	 76.1943178953912
concert and I never heard such an exquisite player.	 102.29653226597013
—Is that a fact?	 39.23368656250443
—Didn’t he, miss Kennedy? The real classical, you know. And blind too,	 113.15481188547014
poor fellow. Not twenty I’m sure he was.	 88.63366948840898
—Is that a fact? Mr Dedalus said.	 17.111099735115438
He drank and strayed away.	 56.662636649096314
—So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled.	 36.10346769795275
God’s curse on bitch’s bastard.	 106.53295980558565
Tink to her pity cried a diner’s bell. To the door of the bar and	 38.65294775734981
diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of	 28.662643434040014
Ormond. Lager for diner. Lager without alacrity she served.	 65.33083467386342
With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for	 62.84834418094834
jinglejaunty blazes boy.	 345.11669690267223
Upholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the	 22.9897535414608
oblique triple (piano!) wires. He pressed (the same who pressed	 111.22951614992208
indulgently her hand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the	 48.92184492813892
thicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in	 59.79683794427984
action.	 5808.1918557069175
Two sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in	 71.96251444673632
Wisdom Hely’s wise Bloom in Daly’s Henry Flower bought. Are you not	 64.04587270177247
happy in your home? Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo. Means	 82.9090260615426
something, language of flow. Was it a daisy? Innocence that is.	 105.09919271859515
Respectable girl meet after mass. Thanks awfully muchly. Wise Bloom	 388.1204824424174
eyed on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves.	 160.16685224010962
Smoke mermaids, coolest whiff of all. Hair streaming: lovelorn. For	 62.92489285189108
some man. For Raoul. He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat	 93.79315958657534
riding on a jaunting car. It is. Again. Third time. Coincidence.	 73.77771378490743
Jingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay.	 163.17628194652957
Follow. Risk it. Go quick. At four. Near now. Out.	 182.9685667604091
—Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.	 48.211935668544506
—Aha... I was forgetting... Excuse...	 178.13091756340572
—And four.	 160.13388505695252
At four she. Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled. Bloo smi qui go.	 197.69696920805617
Ternoon. Think you’re the only pebble on the beach? Does that to all.	 82.37423577840508
For men.	 169.30861980964653
In drowsy silence gold bent on her page.	 102.97767733989834
From the saloon a call came, long in dying. That was a tuningfork the	 120.84851492275646
tuner had that he forgot that he now struck. A call again. That he now	 74.00555628500959
poised that it now throbbed. You hear? It throbbed, pure, purer, softly	 91.86020721201163
and softlier, its buzzing prongs. Longer in dying call.	 102.09369553984608
Pat paid for diner’s popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and	 95.93343444463746
popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss	 124.19479517220581
Douce.	 6144.885442528564
—_The bright stars fade_...	 13.619174861169697
A voiceless song sang from within, singing:	 145.2159400425725
—... _the morn is breaking._	 45.7740321798181
A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive	 25.68540647452337
hands. Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording,	 143.09279683193486
called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love’s	 131.24268838899465
leavetaking, life’s, love’s morn.	 31.940234418533194
—_The dewdrops pearl_...	 6.922777768218444
Lenehan’s lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.	 39.37284178668061
—But look this way, he said, rose of Castile.	 96.66299010303706
Jingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.	 23.877377831173558
She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn,	 77.94110053130248
dreamily rose.	 132.16742764972017
—Did she fall or was she pushed? he asked her.	 107.65531412389676
She answered, slighting:	 154.67285150256046
—Ask no questions and you’ll hear no lies.	 266.4727387311259
Like lady, ladylike.	 196.00476843277568
Blazes Boylan’s smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he	 7.965054274668763
strode. Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar. Lenehan heard and	 134.4246119729736
knew and hailed him:	 141.0279354808655
—See the conquering hero comes.	 103.62691555481548
Between the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered	 86.29757154625622
hero. See me he might. The seat he sat on: warm. Black wary hecat	 146.84065184086157
walked towards Richie Goulding’s legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting.	 365.27724404430023
—_And I from thee_...	 443.84723760219237
—I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.	 120.21510809093101
He touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw. She smiled	 93.02189572109222
on him. But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer	 68.52167517593237
hair, a bosom and a rose.	 353.3162725638493
Smart Boylan bespoke potions.	 122.57641238850033
—What’s your cry? Glass of bitter? Glass of bitter, please, and a	 60.742937912422256
sloegin for me. Wire in yet?	 99.52411706387606
Not yet. At four she. Who said four?	 157.33021096898668
Cowley’s red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff’s	 48.84471595698677
office.	 5720.909779433606
Avoid. Goulding a chance. What is he doing in the Ormond? Car waiting.	 87.31743858913623
Wait.	 936.6644885871088
Hello. Where off to? Something to eat? I too was just. In here. What,	 262.2431543360517
Ormond? Best value in Dublin. Is that so? Diningroom. Sit tight there.	 71.0295780678742
See, not be seen. I think I’ll join you. Come on. Richie led on. Bloom	 72.56351004240031
followed bag. Dinner fit for a prince.	 231.392062155066
Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her	 41.14599410521
bust, that all but burst, so high.	 477.19616608466697
—O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch. O!	 81.12007939171212
But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.	 57.96965211450337
—Why don’t you grow? asked Blazes Boylan.	 67.42453707661792
Shebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his	 47.82190559441364
lips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and	 91.79966569830616
syrupped with her voice:	 37.676762088342336
—Fine goods in small parcels.	 353.15176064199204
That is to say she. Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.	 81.15560694108106
—Here’s fortune, Blazes said.	 174.93549182088267
He pitched a broad coin down. Coin rang.	 48.330773395775516
—Hold on, said Lenehan, till I...	 255.73393769286957
—Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.	 73.61821384701287
—Sceptre will win in a canter, he said.	 55.16198712778896
—I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking. Not on my own, you	 152.81585555123908
know. Fancy of a friend of mine.	 59.54850082681107
Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce’s	 74.55615295096796
lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled.	 98.51291067682587
Idolores. The eastern seas.	 22.311917813495295
Clock whirred. Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who gave),	 129.0757760154874
bearing away teatray. Clock clacked.	 165.27563000325478
Miss Douce took Boylan’s coin, struck boldly the cashregister. It	 58.56923866313533
clanged. Clock clacked. Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till	 58.81484322279713
and hummed and handed coins in change. Look to the west. A clack. For	 90.00773379557303
me.	 695.4423238734375
—What time is that? asked Blazes Boylan. Four?	 70.79477282850311
O’clock.	 10657.846590824054
Lenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged	 103.64823296948178
Blazes Boylan’s elbowsleeve.	 99.35036607908444
—Let’s hear the time, he said.	 60.442581290439854
The bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered	 21.67097249015751
tables. Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table	 72.79554867408638
near the door. Be near. At four. Has he forgotten? Perhaps a trick. Not	 198.81655335016953
come: whet appetite. I couldn’t do. Wait, wait. Pat, waiter, waited.	 34.41936120614269
Sparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure’s skyblue bow and eyes.	 112.51978186369668
—Go on, pressed Lenehan. There’s no-one. He never heard.	 95.0219316052033
—... _to Flora’s lips did hie._	 129.87229280887297
High, a high note pealed in the treble clear.	 107.79147218171975
Bronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought Blazes	 68.32008310576433
Boylan’s flower and eyes.	 458.8240460358097
—Please, please.	 646.352770803057
He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.	 31.22802309694416
—_I could not leave thee_...	 22.044517810247033
—Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly.	 40.98597378187486
—No, now, urged Lenehan. _Sonnez la cloche!_ O do! There’s no-one.	 77.08917420615865
She looked. Quick. Miss Kenn out of earshot. Sudden bent. Two kindling	 104.01551012889327
faces watched her bend.	 326.24903084109286
Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord,	 53.333130892942954
and lost and found it, faltering.	 136.29055100625408
—Go on! Do! _Sonnez!_	 108.4951986420591
Bending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee. Delayed. Taunted	 77.51743600700476
them still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes.	 95.89335593090941
_—Sonnez!_	 10392.922888295721
Smack. She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter	 53.7883810934947
smackwarm against her smackable a woman’s warmhosed thigh.	 61.31308294456524
—_La cloche!_ cried gleeful Lenehan. Trained by owner. No sawdust	 56.46938839251755
there.	 325.19338902170557
She smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren’t men?), but, lightward	 29.6657399949097
gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.	 221.52705615945632
—You’re the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.	 70.27863878006417
Boylan, eyed, eyed. Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his	 252.00926728677825
chalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops. His spellbound	 101.76134376808085
eyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by	 110.51684903991718
mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses	 32.293961442969774
shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with	 58.78752815597552
sunnier bronze.	 125.27509988066868
Yes, bronze from anearby.	 42.142273970864395
—... _Sweetheart, goodbye!_	 669.987469438232
—I’m off, said Boylan with impatience.	 132.12612464131223
He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.	 65.09472434741528
—Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly. I wanted to tell you.	 69.32512677047524
Tom Rochford...	 48.988710047034246
—Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.	 67.18490987217434
Lenehan gulped to go.	 89.39268895644331
—Got the horn or what? he said. Wait. I’m coming.	 119.65061528153889
He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the	 81.40425996688397
threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.	 51.73984869953713
—How do you do, Mr Dollard?	 20.412360139711662
—Eh? How do? How do? Ben Dollard’s vague bass answered, turning an	 161.11686980708308
instant from Father Cowley’s woe. He won’t give you any trouble, Bob.	 135.38555916223993
Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow. We’ll put a barleystraw in	 43.165159704300585
that Judas Iscariot’s ear this time.	 325.57195073068095
Sighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an	 73.73183654977561
eyelid.	 4.608171674364364
—Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily. Come on, Simon. Give us a	 36.56219799820151
ditty. We heard the piano.	 103.56695396281323
Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders. Power for Richie.	 37.27420851158153
And Bloom? Let me see. Not make him walk twice. His corns. Four now.	 86.64291583815307
How warm this black is. Course nerves a bit. Refracts (is it?) heat.	 86.35664576249764
Let me see. Cider. Yes, bottle of cider.	 42.29835553991135
—What’s that? Mr Dedalus said. I was only vamping, man.	 31.352277198080433
—Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called. Begone dull care. Come, Bob.	 212.70004826913433
He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the:	 81.64820633131885
hold him now) into the saloon. He plumped him Dollard on the stool. His	 67.21795721846017
gouty paws plumped chords. Plumped, stopped abrupt.	 82.23300427267951
Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning. Bothered, he wanted	 94.47021819893034
Power and cider. Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar.	 51.028708710372726
Jingle a tinkle jaunted.	 620.3232597944436
Bloom heard a jing, a little sound. He’s off. Light sob of breath Bloom	 113.41389436678949
sighed on the silent bluehued flowers. Jingling. He’s gone. Jingle.	 88.15227776920966
Hear.	 1743.1781081949578
—Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. God be with old times.	 117.88331486006722
Miss Douce’s brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind,	 74.52052352657432
smitten by sunlight. Gone. Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting	 67.55202495668806
light), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord. She drew down	 49.76797157769295
pensive (why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar	 211.70881418912626
where bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast	 238.5612758687262
inexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of	 51.49086903706428
shadow, _eau de Nil._	 101.42693893551788
—Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded	 49.4322957560423
them. There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the	 39.11379168552417
Collard grand.	 226.30930514749244
There was.	 40.647485586107194
—A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said. The devil wouldn’t stop him.	 32.39600486486052
He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.	 42.59630517380867
—God, do you remember? Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the	 46.91729868627886
punished keyboard. And by Japers I had no wedding garment.	 35.3767056780436
They laughed all three. He had no wed. All trio laughed. No wedding	 108.02685608459424
garment.	 22028.924157910955
—Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said. Where’s	 94.71932820190614
my pipe, by the way?	 121.18049971877775
He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe. Bald Pat carried	 64.94842260329276
two diners’ drinks, Richie and Poldy. And Father Cowley laughed again.	 161.48172824432714
—I saved the situation, Ben, I think.	 92.21141604000265
—You did, averred Ben Dollard. I remember those tight trousers too.	 110.39049669364732
That was a brilliant idea, Bob.	 145.41533679825235
Father Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes. He saved the	 34.161506153383456
situa. Tight trou. Brilliant ide.	 59.94025227540548
—I knew he was on the rocks, he said. The wife was playing the piano in	 41.37692871624041
the coffee palace on Saturdays for a very trifling consideration and	 31.331830621178014
who was it gave me the wheeze she was doing the other business? Do you	 40.97008571466948
remember? We had to search all Holles street to find them till the chap	 100.6929380943191
in Keogh’s gave us the number. Remember?	 154.326447774164
Ben remembered, his broad visage wondering.	 92.92279371962427
—By God, she had some luxurious operacloaks and things there.	 56.869554066190936
Mr Dedalus wandered back, pipe in hand.	 32.98651731842769
—Merrion square style. Balldresses, by God, and court dresses. He	 50.95412775338088
wouldn’t take any money either. What? Any God’s quantity of cocked hats	 85.1375848849033
and boleros and trunkhose. What?	 20.734705330499715
—Ay, ay, Mr Dedalus nodded. Mrs Marion Bloom has left off clothes of	 39.359941615654314
all descriptions.	 43.41838921676901
Jingle jaunted down the quays. Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.	 34.29592897364173
Liver and bacon. Steak and kidney pie. Right, sir. Right, Pat.	 78.21766810346797
Mrs Marion. Met him pike hoses. Smell of burn. Of Paul de Kock. Nice	 25.361532931306158
name he.	 215.44671201974637
—What’s this her name was? A buxom lassy. Marion...	 84.00544582330465
—Tweedy.	 17411.627743303983
—Yes. Is she alive?	 207.60818768727626
—And kicking.	 217.24501589602735
—She was a daughter of...	 35.1537091354361
—Daughter of the regiment.	 20.122483269502617
—Yes, begad. I remember the old drummajor.	 41.36936371396742
Mr Dedalus struck, whizzed, lit, puffed savoury puff after	 96.72275727610483
—Irish? I don’t know, faith. Is she, Simon?	 154.07942478457002
Puff after stiff, a puff, strong, savoury, crackling.	 219.11747516488182
—Buccinator muscle is... What?... Bit rusty... O, she is... My Irish	 103.18801864268508
Molly, O.	 539.9821612878585
He puffed a pungent plumy blast.	 65.71466947273106
—From the rock of Gibraltar... all the way.	 73.34952829693718
They pined in depth of ocean shadow, gold by the beerpull, bronze by	 50.51814239743403
maraschino, thoughtful all two. Mina Kennedy, 4 Lismore terrace,	 43.05603944303397
Drumcondra with Idolores, a queen, Dolores, silent.	 65.1805801531974
Pat served, uncovered dishes. Leopold cut liverslices. As said before	 153.08800927483307
he ate with relish the inner organs, nutty gizzards, fried cods’ roes	 26.749724777957482
while Richie Goulding, Collis, Ward ate steak and kidney, steak then	 19.515709535067696
kidney, bite by bite of pie he ate Bloom ate they ate.	 198.03169237410015
Bloom with Goulding, married in silence, ate. Dinners fit for princes.	 76.65229206584694
By Bachelor’s walk jogjaunty jingled Blazes Boylan, bachelor, in sun in	 47.06328128397071
heat, mare’s glossy rump atrot, with flick of whip, on bounding tyres:	 17.195828610277946
sprawled, warmseated, Boylan impatience, ardentbold. Horn. Have you	 265.66273076290094
the? Horn. Have you the? Haw haw horn.	 61.89039561462545
Over their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding	 60.2168699362971
chords:	 15318.770671776232
—_When love absorbs my ardent soul_...	 73.3968471357914
Roll of Bensoulbenjamin rolled to the quivery loveshivery roofpanes.	 19.54359506302855
—War! War! cried Father Cowley. You’re the warrior.	 72.31248443515268
—So I am, Ben Warrior laughed. I was thinking of your landlord. Love or	 92.3787297259562
money.	 3471.2276245549806
He stopped. He wagged huge beard, huge face over his blunder huge.	 118.15366234973719
—Sure, you’d burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr Dedalus said	 45.151272714650275
through smoke aroma, with an organ like yours.	 124.93690991327577
In bearded abundant laughter Dollard shook upon the keyboard. He would.	 60.02215432969371
—Not to mention another membrane, Father Cowley added. Half time, Ben.	 122.48901741879179
_Amoroso ma non troppo._ Let me there.	 38.192643153179944
Miss Kennedy served two gentlemen with tankards of cool stout. She	 141.08232198527963
passed a remark. It was indeed, first gentleman said, beautiful	 171.70329813257771
weather. They drank cool stout. Did she know where the lord lieutenant	 195.41406053047206
was going? And heard steelhoofs ringhoof ring. No, she couldn’t say.	 130.7334931751367
But it would be in the paper. O, she need not trouble. No trouble. She	 86.48333102932676
waved about her outspread _Independent,_ searching, the lord	 136.11818949587771
lieutenant, her pinnacles of hair slowmoving, lord lieuten. Too much	 99.6236985021944
trouble, first gentleman said. O, not in the least. Way he looked that.	 135.68880099018193
Lord lieutenant. Gold by bronze heard iron steel.	 201.60363582903676
—............ _my ardent soul	 86.22881301324375
I care not foror the morrow._	 42.03508787084054
In liver gravy Bloom mashed mashed potatoes. Love and War someone is.	 70.05936338178793
Ben Dollard’s famous. Night he ran round to us to borrow a dress suit	 72.82154699870246
for that concert. Trousers tight as a drum on him. Musical porkers.	 97.05329893101253
Molly did laugh when he went out. Threw herself back across the bed,	 100.13451631181479
screaming, kicking. With all his belongings on show. O saints above,	 50.04346639406821
I’m drenched! O, the women in the front row! O, I never laughed so	 120.92257726110562
many! Well, of course that’s what gives him the base barreltone. For	 71.71706790074558
instance eunuchs. Wonder who’s playing. Nice touch. Must be Cowley.	 249.5711022997629
Musical. Knows whatever note you play. Bad breath he has, poor chap.	 169.547866544495
Stopped.	 4846.178618443531
Miss Douce, engaging, Lydia Douce, bowed to suave solicitor, George	 63.62562882507835
Lidwell, gentleman, entering. Good afternoon. She gave her moist (a	 150.62328202883117
lady’s) hand to his firm clasp. Afternoon. Yes, she was back. To the	 124.30266562727253
old dingdong again.	 164.46460358749454
—Your friends are inside, Mr Lidwell.	 185.70340738190455
George Lidwell, suave, solicited, held a lydiahand.	 26.743597466494315
Bloom ate liv as said before. Clean here at least. That chap in the	 66.29006339631755
Burton, gummy with gristle. No-one here: Goulding and I. Clean tables,	 142.8800659792908
flowers, mitres of napkins. Pat to and fro. Bald Pat. Nothing to do.	 62.15401635156487
Best value in Dub.	 22.56906175091123
Piano again. Cowley it is. Way he sits in to it, like one together,	 170.78671312562324
mutual understanding. Tiresome shapers scraping fiddles, eye on the	 31.21662594739997
bowend, sawing the cello, remind you of toothache. Her high long snore.	 33.23037654122306
Night we were in the box. Trombone under blowing like a grampus,	 63.453870829060904
between the acts, other brass chap unscrewing, emptying spittle.	 37.59541621805052
Conductor’s legs too, bagstrousers, jiggedy jiggedy. Do right to hide	 80.78819489227305
them.	 436.51515115481243
Jiggedy jingle jaunty jaunty.	 24.223303918347792
Only the harp. Lovely. Gold glowering light. Girl touched it. Poop of a	 150.59647385077054
lovely. Gravy’s rather good fit for a. Golden ship. Erin. The harp that	 135.92472230165444
once or twice. Cool hands. Ben Howth, the rhododendrons. We are their	 110.79845455038905
harps. I. He. Old. Young.	 234.559828659149
—Ah, I couldn’t, man, Mr Dedalus said, shy, listless.	 87.27856703747636
Strongly.	 4.608171674364364
—Go on, blast you! Ben Dollard growled. Get it out in bits.	 40.31783884774288
—_M’appari,_ Simon, Father Cowley said.	 17.587952093647893
Down stage he strode some paces, grave, tall in affliction, his long	 234.21193912471017
arms outheld. Hoarsely the apple of his throat hoarsed softly. Softly	 86.5624993920149
he sang to a dusty seascape there: _A Last Farewell._ A headland, a	 74.18369493620277
ship, a sail upon the billows. Farewell. A lovely girl, her veil awave	 144.9157320745281
upon the wind upon the headland, wind around her.	 98.52932860990066
Cowley sang:	 1060.445070259348
_—M’appari tutt’amor:	 4.411654744205047
Il mio sguardo l’incontr..._	 20.682904390858088
She waved, unhearing Cowley, her veil, to one departing, dear one, to	 189.86104722362202
wind, love, speeding sail, return.	 466.2192857950748
—Go on, Simon.	 98.96517373001943
—Ah, sure, my dancing days are done, Ben... Well...	 201.70201070433458
Mr Dedalus laid his pipe to rest beside the tuningfork and, sitting,	 62.34372914184837
touched the obedient keys.	 191.2276836541467
—No, Simon, Father Cowley turned. Play it in the original. One flat.	 79.17904346534173
The keys, obedient, rose higher, told, faltered, confessed, confused.	 66.57931574252007
Up stage strode Father Cowley.	 82.52625988185491
—Here, Simon, I’ll accompany you, he said. Get up.	 76.62836983487023
By Graham Lemon’s pineapple rock, by Elvery’s elephant jingly jogged.	 15.537074607801845
Steak, kidney, liver, mashed, at meat fit for princes sat princes Bloom	 58.347743073893525
and Goulding. Princes at meat they raised and drank, Power and cider.	 120.07889420096299
Most beautiful tenor air ever written, Richie said: _Sonnambula._ He	 149.36536861045602
heard Joe Maas sing that one night. Ah, what M’Guckin! Yes. In his way.	 168.47090124920553
Choirboy style. Maas was the boy. Massboy. A lyrical tenor if you like.	 69.51774868301679
Never forget it. Never.	 72.68304547527369
Tenderly Bloom over liverless bacon saw the tightened features strain.	 130.66824603409003
Backache he. Bright’s bright eye. Next item on the programme. Paying	 56.14912152489053
the piper. Pills, pounded bread, worth a guinea a box. Stave it off	 134.6152969204023
awhile. Sings too: _Down among the dead men._ Appropriate. Kidney pie.	 164.62139907214103
Sweets to the. Not making much hand of it. Best value in.	 204.4605291105308
Characteristic of him. Power. Particular about his drink. Flaw in the	 82.75586323797245
glass, fresh Vartry water. Fecking matches from counters to save. Then	 113.01982653527932
squander a sovereign in dribs and drabs. And when he’s wanted not a	 33.498914436078444
farthing. Screwed refusing to pay his fare. Curious types.	 25.009086106139435
Never would Richie forget that night. As long as he lived: never. In	 67.00116070215188
the gods of the old Royal with little Peake. And when the first note.	 43.751189737000395
Speech paused on Richie’s lips.	 83.37828927334569
Coming out with a whopper now. Rhapsodies about damn all. Believes his	 66.30442491142406
own lies. Does really. Wonderful liar. But want a good memory.	 187.09489652740035
—Which air is that? asked Leopold Bloom.	 135.78637439785152
—_All is lost now_.	 39.70780476212836
Richie cocked his lips apout. A low incipient note sweet banshee	 105.94621233527415
murmured: all. A thrush. A throstle. His breath, birdsweet, good teeth	 102.1988611171293
he’s proud of, fluted with plaintive woe. Is lost. Rich sound. Two	 115.39955320075772
notes in one there. Blackbird I heard in the hawthorn valley. Taking my	 91.29388692574692
motives he twined and turned them. All most too new call is lost in	 152.02631158276424
all. Echo. How sweet the answer. How is that done? All lost now.	 170.58543833502722
Mournful he whistled. Fall, surrender, lost.	 222.3001625422589
Bloom bent leopold ear, turning a fringe of doyley down under the vase.	 52.79529998001088
Order. Yes, I remember. Lovely air. In sleep she went to him. Innocence	 150.19437596531242
in the moon. Brave. Don’t know their danger. Still hold her back. Call	 154.90563976020263
name. Touch water. Jingle jaunty. Too late. She longed to go. That’s	 94.99098804555557
why. Woman. As easy stop the sea. Yes: all is lost.	 164.3225513929203
—A beautiful air, said Bloom lost Leopold. I know it well.	 189.4357785568402
Never in all his life had Richie Goulding.	 105.64821995985709
He knows it well too. Or he feels. Still harping on his daughter. Wise	 121.87560775545289
child that knows her father, Dedalus said. Me?	 98.8735201371359
Bloom askance over liverless saw. Face of the all is lost. Rollicking	 106.19578479302659
Richie once. Jokes old stale now. Wagging his ear. Napkinring in his	 157.05065168240372
eye. Now begging letters he sends his son with. Crosseyed Walter sir I	 152.32244382870772
did sir. Wouldn’t trouble only I was expecting some money. Apologise.	 91.24122659350698
Piano again. Sounds better than last time I heard. Tuned probably.	 79.8941130949064
Stopped again.	 863.4975988611017
Dollard and Cowley still urged the lingering singer out with it.	 112.05716958948052
—With it, Simon.	 135.01235472382373
—It, Simon.	 293.1248769184399
—Ladies and gentlemen, I am most deeply obliged by your kind	 105.36181635966857
solicitations.	 4.608171674364364
—It, Simon.	 293.1248769184399
—I have no money but if you will lend me your attention I shall	 56.50976668325217
endeavour to sing to you of a heart bowed down.	 131.4074514405327
By the sandwichbell in screening shadow Lydia, her bronze and rose, a	 56.01126726331513
lady’s grace, gave and withheld: as in cool glaucous _eau de Nil_ Mina	 123.46454662988506
to tankards two her pinnacles of gold.	 214.47982874322693
The harping chords of prelude closed. A chord, longdrawn, expectant,	 32.23413174871133
drew a voice away.	 525.8365705399902
—_When first I saw that form endearing_...	 32.08270114868941
Richie turned.	 1169.719155351719
—Si Dedalus’ voice, he said.	 144.6021558676692
Braintipped, cheek touched with flame, they listened feeling that flow	 220.81160438740193
endearing flow over skin limbs human heart soul spine. Bloom signed to	 153.60968455217
Pat, bald Pat is a waiter hard of hearing, to set ajar the door of the	 30.328696316673824
bar. The door of the bar. So. That will do. Pat, waiter, waited,	 35.860719128532
waiting to hear, for he was hard of hear by the door.	 118.7026407745493
—_Sorrow from me seemed to depart._	 85.46743015328084
Through the hush of air a voice sang to them, low, not rain, not leaves	 131.4639286389644
in murmur, like no voice of strings or reeds or whatdoyoucallthem	 109.4988516912213
dulcimers touching their still ears with words, still hearts of their	 159.91417584184876
each his remembered lives. Good, good to hear: sorrow from them each	 371.37759585880525
seemed to from both depart when first they heard. When first they saw,	 169.2671168691145
lost Richie Poldy, mercy of beauty, heard from a person wouldn’t expect	 90.66449963330936
it in the least, her first merciful lovesoft oftloved word.	 93.85359810678692
Love that is singing: love’s old sweet song. Bloom unwound slowly the	 50.5705935836492
elastic band of his packet. Love’s old sweet _sonnez la_ gold. Bloom	 28.654055707051054
wound a skein round four forkfingers, stretched it, relaxed, and wound	 120.2760169871666
it round his troubled double, fourfold, in octave, gyved them fast.	 66.67653546802038
—_Full of hope and all delighted_...	 171.98001696304982
Tenors get women by the score. Increase their flow. Throw flower at his	 182.05193472053156
feet. When will we meet? My head it simply. Jingle all delighted. He	 127.54477771219108
can’t sing for tall hats. Your head it simply swurls. Perfumed for him.	 113.82076618678938
What perfume does your wife? I want to know. Jing. Stop. Knock. Last	 41.71853338293768
look at mirror always before she answers the door. The hall. There? How	 152.68638672807685
do you? I do well. There? What? Or? Phial of cachous, kissing comfits,	 89.81325584806754
in her satchel. Yes? Hands felt for the opulent.	 31.94603116302866
Alas the voice rose, sighing, changed: loud, full, shining, proud.	 434.0505792031578
—_But alas, ’twas idle dreaming_...	 44.35438476868557
Glorious tone he has still. Cork air softer also their brogue. Silly	 114.97171650873828
man! Could have made oceans of money. Singing wrong words. Wore out his	 134.39957978050072
wife: now sings. But hard to tell. Only the two themselves. If he	 95.83781228613965
doesn’t break down. Keep a trot for the avenue. His hands and feet sing	 143.70070953249692
too. Drink. Nerves overstrung. Must be abstemious to sing. Jenny Lind	 37.75265554329902
soup: stock, sage, raw eggs, half pint of cream. For creamy dreamy.	 383.7150477075926
Tenderness it welled: slow, swelling, full it throbbed. That’s the	 60.58437846070972
chat. Ha, give! Take! Throb, a throb, a pulsing proud erect.	 223.44466347550753
Words? Music? No: it’s what’s behind.	 393.3862182536565
Bloom looped, unlooped, noded, disnoded.	 6.557839166535052
Bloom. Flood of warm jamjam lickitup secretness flowed to flow in music	 44.163007835652685
out, in desire, dark to lick flow invading. Tipping her tepping her	 96.51616318285049
tapping her topping her. Tup. Pores to dilate dilating. Tup. The joy	 39.15759627420268
the feel the warm the. Tup. To pour o’er sluices pouring gushes. Flood,	 197.35325470915427
gush, flow, joygush, tupthrob. Now! Language of love.	 96.04398207811877
—... _ray of hope is_...	 59.20906350579755
Beaming. Lydia for Lidwell squeak scarcely hear so ladylike the muse	 155.86105005281436
unsqueaked a ray of hopk.	 6.780771958656679
_Martha_ it is. Coincidence. Just going to write. Lionel’s song. Lovely	 92.51675990990692
name you have. Can’t write. Accept my little pres. Play on her	 82.02915826366512
heartstrings pursestrings too. She’s a. I called you naughty boy. Still	 62.961709928102565
the name: Martha. How strange! Today.	 168.2472169695432
The voice of Lionel returned, weaker but unwearied. It sang again to	 45.42827329004477
Richie Poldy Lydia Lidwell also sang to Pat open mouth ear waiting to	 266.2570225956186
wait. How first he saw that form endearing, how sorrow seemed to part,	 62.04414566756526
how look, form, word charmed him Gould Lidwell, won Pat Bloom’s heart.	 141.0884304449938
Wish I could see his face, though. Explain better. Why the barber in	 48.41768243793427
Drago’s always looked my face when I spoke his face in the glass. Still	 125.1632452687614
hear it better here than in the bar though farther.	 273.6106203530162
—_Each graceful look_...	 476.7859525552117
First night when first I saw her at Mat Dillon’s in Terenure. Yellow,	 44.11063325378164
black lace she wore. Musical chairs. We two the last. Fate. After her.	 165.25913610374533
Fate. Round and round slow. Quick round. We two. All looked. Halt. Down	 214.46497707394025
she sat. All ousted looked. Lips laughing. Yellow knees.	 202.73267552937403
—_Charmed my eye_...	 493.0905147598081
Singing. _Waiting_ she sang. I turned her music. Full voice of perfume	 309.73143093849296
of what perfume does your lilactrees. Bosom I saw, both full, throat	 88.54149819160206
warbling. First I saw. She thanked me. Why did she me? Fate. Spanishy	 98.96876616070412

—_Martha! Ah, Martha!_	 180.01367737483196
Quitting all languor Lionel cried in grief, in cry of passion dominant	 97.80138839952468
to love to return with deepening yet with rising chords of harmony. In	 109.21243187594314
cry of lionel loneliness that she should know, must martha feel. For	 147.3266250676414
only her he waited. Where? Here there try there here all try where.	 226.75270830954534
Somewhere.	 5039.27147184513
—_Co-ome, thou lost one!	 29.000666020470778
Co-ome, thou dear one!_	 92.60087148879181
Alone. One love. One hope. One comfort me. Martha, chestnote, return!	 411.0842599097548
_—Come!_	 382.81606238906494
It soared, a bird, it held its flight, a swift pure cry, soar silver	 131.50789833411807
orb it leaped serene, speeding, sustained, to come, don’t spin it out	 42.54458747068267
too long long breath he breath long life, soaring high, high	 274.10726074863584
resplendent, aflame, crowned, high in the effulgence symbolistic, high,	 23.70543193763573
of the etherial bosom, high, of the high vast irradiation everywhere	 67.24121897541708
all soaring all around about the all, the endlessnessnessness...	 65.92508464114758

clap. Sound as a bell. Bravo, Simon! Clapclopclap. Encore, enclap,	 174.24316505012834

Pat, Mina Kennedy, two gentlemen with two tankards, Cowley, first gent	 80.43440360893905
with tank and bronze Miss Douce and gold Miss Mina.	 52.94603097693624
Blazes Boylan’s smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor, said before.	 8.926313432854073
Jingle by monuments of sir John Gray, Horatio onehandled Nelson,	 34.317297807462666

Atrot, in heat, heatseated. _Cloche. Sonnez la. Cloche. Sonnez la._	 17.206459690341706
Slower the mare went up the hill by the Rotunda, Rutland square. Too	 60.17003313218015
slow for Boylan, blazes Boylan, impatience Boylan, joggled the mare.	 70.81346564254522
An afterclang of Cowley’s chords closed, died on the air made richer.	 69.90932552481661
And Richie Goulding drank his Power and Leopold Bloom his cider drank,	 116.79361186600929
Lidwell his Guinness, second gentleman said they would partake of two	 196.20137076822363
more tankards if she did not mind. Miss Kennedy smirked, disserving,	 46.60140111451446
coral lips, at first, at second. She did not mind.	 94.4299844874802
—Seven days in jail, Ben Dollard said, on bread and water. Then you’d	 69.27448876995946
sing, Simon, like a garden thrush.	 189.62533554202153
Lionel Simon, singer, laughed. Father Bob Cowley played. Mina Kennedy	 160.8927600312196
served. Second gentleman paid. Tom Kernan strutted in. Lydia, admired,	 156.57050878871013
admired. But Bloom sang dumb.	 309.3988028187255
Admiring.	 4.608171674364364
Richie, admiring, descanted on that man’s glorious voice. He remembered	 142.28350961016696
one night long ago. Never forget that night. Si sang _’Twas rank and	 27.99322189720095
fame_: in Ned Lambert’s ’twas. Good God he never heard in all his life	 102.25501485096322
a note like that he never did _then false one we had better part_ so	 81.6610521548855
clear so God he never heard _since love lives not_ a clinking voice	 112.76332069427424
lives not ask Lambert he can tell you too.	 207.22643935576295
Goulding, a flush struggling in his pale, told Mr Bloom, face of the	 104.74482176755707
night, Si in Ned Lambert’s, Dedalus house, sang _’Twas rank and fame._	 41.36320629134265
He, Mr Bloom, listened while he, Richie Goulding, told him, Mr Bloom,	 39.05405071943406
of the night he, Richie, heard him, Si Dedalus, sing _’Twas rank and	 63.78164432451449
fame_ in his, Ned Lambert’s, house.	 109.4310198540388
Brothers-in-law: relations. We never speak as we pass by. Rift in the	 39.959933659094894
lute I think. Treats him with scorn. See. He admires him all the more.	 60.945055894458456
The night Si sang. The human voice, two tiny silky chords, wonderful,	 82.40692927166121
more than all others.	 123.94596894527555
That voice was a lamentation. Calmer now. It’s in the silence after you	 71.2637727594817
feel you hear. Vibrations. Now silent air.	 232.13911950364425
Bloom ungyved his crisscrossed hands and with slack fingers plucked the	 27.52506478543127
slender catgut thong. He drew and plucked. It buzz, it twanged. While	 97.28502684879221
Goulding talked of Barraclough’s voice production, while Tom Kernan,	 98.84092227020925
harking back in a retrospective sort of arrangement talked to listening	 96.85097829827906
Father Cowley, who played a voluntary, who nodded as he played. While	 69.80541370195876
big Ben Dollard talked with Simon Dedalus, lighting, who nodded as he	 34.400348129354406
smoked, who smoked.	 22.239311718416765
Thou lost one. All songs on that theme. Yet more Bloom stretched his	 125.8234633072125
string. Cruel it seems. Let people get fond of each other: lure them	 87.4432184059637
on. Then tear asunder. Death. Explos. Knock on the head.	 159.32470775783165
Outtohelloutofthat. Human life. Dignam. Ugh, that rat’s tail wriggling!	 111.7614175536604
Five bob I gave. _Corpus paradisum._ Corncrake croaker: belly like a	 51.51175031734285
poisoned pup. Gone. They sing. Forgotten. I too. And one day she with.	 268.10682957554053
Leave her: get tired. Suffer then. Snivel. Big spanishy eyes goggling	 162.00552160659925
at nothing. Her wavyavyeavyheavyeavyevyevyhair un comb:’d.	 92.3837071485255
Yet too much happy bores. He stretched more, more. Are you not happy in	 69.82995054651788
your? Twang. It snapped.	 61.89776987685661
Jingle into Dorset street.	 208.773680115218
Miss Douce withdrew her satiny arm, reproachful, pleased.	 46.82457422373412
—Don’t make half so free, said she, till we are better acquainted.	 155.68300910148588
George Lidwell told her really and truly: but she did not believe.	 51.728535852512806
First gentleman told Mina that was so. She asked him was that so. And	 109.16362075012637
second tankard told her so. That that was so.	 73.74738993704123
Miss Douce, miss Lydia, did not believe: miss Kennedy, Mina, did not	 56.65641409737136
believe: George Lidwell, no: miss Dou did not: the first, the first:	 136.68072614281704
gent with the tank: believe, no, no: did not, miss Kenn: Lidlydiawell:	 77.73910888400454
the tank.	 139.36881989050363
Better write it here. Quills in the postoffice chewed and twisted.	 75.99255458546811
Bald Pat at a sign drew nigh. A pen and ink. He went. A pad. He went. A	 86.28092427972624
pad to blot. He heard, deaf Pat.	 102.4507424617893
—Yes, Mr Bloom said, teasing the curling catgut line. It certainly is.	 22.33756886649409
Few lines will do. My present. All that Italian florid music is. Who is	 130.39405452204778
this wrote? Know the name you know better. Take out sheet notepaper,	 140.97264795535577
envelope: unconcerned. It’s so characteristic.	 156.2208514073346
—Grandest number in the whole opera, Goulding said.	 60.371303770179566
—It is, Bloom said.	 81.82782231711809
Numbers it is. All music when you come to think. Two multiplied by two	 93.57189163287967
divided by half is twice one. Vibrations: chords those are. One plus	 177.9147274298478
two plus six is seven. Do anything you like with figures juggling.	 279.3026039184809
Always find out this equal to that. Symmetry under a cemetery wall. He	 57.38481291694652
doesn’t see my mourning. Callous: all for his own gut. Musemathematics.	 63.34589598140815
And you think you’re listening to the etherial. But suppose you said it	 39.366966474443714
like: Martha, seven times nine minus x is thirtyfive thousand. Fall	 78.53631878013626
quite flat. It’s on account of the sounds it is.	 81.16239547544704
Instance he’s playing now. Improvising. Might be what you like, till	 88.21886795509306
you hear the words. Want to listen sharp. Hard. Begin all right: then	 118.4767136199776
hear chords a bit off: feel lost a bit. In and out of sacks, over	 73.14565656910901
barrels, through wirefences, obstacle race. Time makes the tune.	 234.81467891376167
Question of mood you’re in. Still always nice to hear. Except scales up	 154.7221207894177
and down, girls learning. Two together nextdoor neighbours. Ought to	 65.33948596057861
invent dummy pianos for that. _Blumenlied_ I bought for her. The name.	 64.17663321706677
Playing it slow, a girl, night I came home, the girl. Door of the	 167.88138250705208
stables near Cecilia street. Milly no taste. Queer because we both, I	 272.9399403355134
mean.	 3743.147772450615
Bald deaf Pat brought quite flat pad ink. Pat set with ink pen quite	 73.53944185307446
flat pad. Pat took plate dish knife fork. Pat went.	 42.25281156147529
It was the only language Mr Dedalus said to Ben. He heard them as a boy	 53.86407425345672
in Ringabella, Crosshaven, Ringabella, singing their barcaroles.	 26.72554816474323
Queenstown harbour full of Italian ships. Walking, you know, Ben, in	 167.6379738816607
the moonlight with those earthquake hats. Blending their voices. God,	 97.51157753885079
such music, Ben. Heard as a boy. Cross Ringabella haven mooncarole.	 153.7562175749147
Sour pipe removed he held a shield of hand beside his lips that cooed a	 78.45426719012504
moonlight nightcall, clear from anear, a call from afar, replying.	 110.96395766679464
Down the edge of his _Freeman_ baton ranged Bloom’s, your other eye,	 107.21909304586968
scanning for where did I see that. Callan, Coleman, Dignam Patrick.	 79.61796351718107
Heigho! Heigho! Fawcett. Aha! Just I was looking...	 179.05743991923958
Hope he’s not looking, cute as a rat. He held unfurled his _Freeman._	 130.29204637433565
Can’t see now. Remember write Greek ees. Bloom dipped, Bloo mur: dear	 114.14941766784426

Bore this. Bored Bloom tambourined gently with I am just reflecting	 100.75750713192816
fingers on flat pad Pat brought.	 47.36737088742101
On. Know what I mean. No, change that ee. Accep my poor litt pres	 70.23009576614594

You naughty too? O, Mairy lost the string of her. Bye for today. Yes,	 100.26297645709114
yes, will tell you. Want to. To keep it up. Call me that other. Other	 45.541508171306155

penny out of him.	 113.60028659991005
—That the lay you’re on now? says Joe.	 107.19128566805755
—Ay, says I. How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful	 45.84054216806893
debts. But that’s the most notorious bloody robber you’d meet in a	 82.50810395332906
day’s walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of	 54.10922580202375
rain. _Tell him,_ says he, _I dare him,_ says he, _and I doubledare him	 44.491604980017655
to send you round here again or if he does,_ says he, _I’ll have him	 123.6182539870992
summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a	 61.22093349336492
licence._ And he after stuffing himself till he’s fit to burst. Jesus,	 170.7081430812591
I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out. _He drink me	 74.6084133682717
my teas. He eat me my sugars. Because he no pay me my moneys?_	 102.13685358141606
For nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of 13 Saint Kevin’s	 80.97560554984484
parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter	 37.149479426983206
called the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E. Geraghty,	 174.2384221192698
esquire, of 29 Arbour hill in the city of Dublin, Arran quay ward,	 27.75907534560627
gentleman, hereinafter called the purchaser, videlicet, five pounds	 202.19741528448282
avoirdupois of first choice tea at three shillings and no pence per	 67.36911801086767

crystal, at threepence per pound avoirdupois, the said purchaser debtor	 88.43341404716833
to the said vendor of one pound five shillings and sixpence sterling	 54.967401669244865
for value received which amount shall be paid by said purchaser to said	 124.53265698407425
vendor in weekly instalments every seven calendar days of three	 241.88061416354702
shillings and no pence sterling: and the said nonperishable goods shall	 167.92507268155777
not be pawned or pledged or sold or otherwise alienated by the said	 46.16283586183052
purchaser but shall be and remain and be held to be the sole and	 130.0235242582302
exclusive property of the said vendor to be disposed of at his good	 54.13612927712231
will and pleasure until the said amount shall have been duly paid by	 97.88983624675298
the said purchaser to the said vendor in the manner herein set forth as	 47.79489105772896
this day hereby agreed between the said vendor, his heirs, successors,	 68.18493124599075
trustees and assigns of the one part and the said purchaser, his heirs,	 22.40933652326984
successors, trustees and assigns of the other part.	 14.391304706699364
—Are you a strict t.t.? says Joe.	 22.48396458470736
—Not taking anything between drinks, says I.	 84.53662024931454
—What about paying our respects to our friend? says Joe.	 40.0601600366895
—Who? says I. Sure, he’s out in John of God’s off his head, poor man.	 153.11260130524846
—Drinking his own stuff? says Joe.	 59.74289586342871
—Ay, says I. Whisky and water on the brain.	 53.59335204602245
—Come around to Barney Kiernan’s, says Joe. I want to see the citizen.	 23.916078185735334
—Barney mavourneen’s be it, says I. Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?	 348.8539738449078
—Not a word, says Joe. I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.	 30.368311468664174
—What was that, Joe? says I.	 35.08551190560441
—Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease. I want to	 40.1453694157915
give the citizen the hard word about it.	 192.96714945153923
So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the	 26.026394759273458
courthouse talking of one thing or another. Decent fellow Joe when he	 67.26468447828945
has it but sure like that he never has it. Jesus, I couldn’t get over	 123.57057148797057
that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber. For trading without a	 40.887266180721525
licence, says he.	 82.70023788419061
In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. There	 126.82481265431524
rises a watchtower beheld of men afar. There sleep the mighty dead as	 129.90365339270892
in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown. A pleasant	 81.85302154514868
land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport	 56.13278901181278
the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock,	 9.667696021784698
the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed	 19.820779635169288
coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too	 35.42825814679702
numerous to be enumerated. In the mild breezes of the west and of the	 16.808905552880766
east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass	 66.59662435467439
foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted	 6.683510986390727
planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal	 8.95549059710922
world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied. Lovely	 111.3402937934377
maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing	 37.98379946929619
the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects	 52.768378970845845
as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts	 67.17731490842091
of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful	 13.568622690031756
insects. And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to	 21.873366890947057
Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht	 18.383163465276034
the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruachan’s land and of	 74.9875183886256
Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the	 72.76499763518744
sons of kings.	 28.21531977951426
And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen	 61.73233410898586
by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for	 46.819536419883384
that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits	 52.14190430575233
of that land for O’Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain	 60.5618306331294
descended from chieftains. Thither the extremely large wains bring	 106.1463260377784
foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach,	 27.35757815260291
pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs,	 68.59802578039992
drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale,	 5.6411414103007695
York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets	 28.509603856022945
of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and	 11.666374821727445
red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples	 142.53805600763488
and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and	 25.235085586971376
pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their	 28.861808238094802
canes.	 4.608171674364364
I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him. Come out here, Geraghty, you	 43.009742856398816
notorious bloody hill and dale robber!	 19.932528798198952
And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed	 32.49582783564031
ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers	 9.95125505499918
and roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and	 12.840804010708057
Cuffe’s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the	 12.153420770719382
various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus	 33.73434766570341
heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime	 19.070863569554916
premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling,	 15.739357133205734
cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting,	 70.366408793726
champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from	 24.212533448670527
pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy	 13.696695544377679
vales of Thomond, from the M’Gillicuddy’s reeks the inaccessible and	 8.331585845937138
lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the	 14.479720553093161
place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance	 24.871755003442587
of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer’s firkins	 37.12001626948391
and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great	 37.82165571236608
hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.	 86.0047753337639
So we turned into Barney Kiernan’s and there, sure enough, was the	 59.99620653131074
citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that	 80.61286981152435
bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would	 119.69388235217149
drop in the way of drink.	 74.3324348699666
—There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his	 42.96347072735355
load of papers, working for the cause.	 176.90028948433496
The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps.	 30.13868066222098
Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that	 95.5437139020796
bloody dog. I’m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off	 74.4872813776378
a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper	 49.51794169472223
about a licence.	 199.1750825325679
—Stand and deliver, says he.	 126.48888508726327
—That’s all right, citizen, says Joe. Friends here.	 24.25381123641403
—Pass, friends, says he.	 270.1866014308941
Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:	 39.62482379707686
—What’s your opinion of the times?	 71.23761828917627
Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill. But, begob, Joe was equal to	 41.01473826138915
the occasion.	 262.03426372411724
—I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his	 48.51082300199706
fork.	 8890.1493802269
So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:	 36.67338734851564
—Foreign wars is the cause of it.	 65.67424840485735
And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:	 35.97409016128981
—It’s the Russians wish to tyrannise.	 51.49130038683997
—Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I. I’ve a thirst on me	 111.73879557167965
I wouldn’t sell for half a crown.	 96.31445060330884
—Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.	 69.12036719247035
—Wine of the country, says he.	 73.41548093589445
—What’s yours? says Joe.	 61.81906077963997
—Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.	 21.771955603702118
—Three pints, Terry, says Joe. And how’s the old heart, citizen? says	 57.965164762408406
he.	 39.122286468479096
—Never better, _a chara_, says he. What Garry? Are we going to win? Eh?	 56.66767164537738
And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck	 30.500170168397894
and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.	 78.47509461489241
The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was	 49.07357113397382
that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired	 11.398758846869526
freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded	 3.933542382544028
deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed	 3.857285642109819
hero. From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his	 107.81802828566434
rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of	 47.27219177791773
his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair	 67.89595812249405
in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (_Ulex Europeus_).	 44.80596980746627
The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue	 32.348266730785156
projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous	 43.03965586964409
obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. The eyes in	 34.9182609468704
which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the	 58.72754318115458
dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. A powerful current of warm	 20.79685404485357
breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his	 26.9398457908005
mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations	 66.74235114280278
of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the	 29.383657537292038
summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to	 37.82887795369255
vibrate and tremble.	 6.065069416742295
He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to	 33.22787719342596
the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a	 99.19599674964016
girdle of plaited straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of	 54.41414825474146
deerskin, roughly stitched with gut. His nether extremities were	 13.736881005642998
encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet	 39.42692571554254
being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of	 19.390382990618335
the same beast. From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled	 48.69975714376484
at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with	 49.30923908633315
rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and	 95.57663267048326
heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine	 19.434308179161697

Philip O’Sullivan Beare. A couched spear of acuminated granite rested	 71.23211360797846
by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe	 64.52405676012138
whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a	 66.81000629117246
supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which	 25.342770733746043
his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a	 82.57533628558734
mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.	 110.25670070394006
So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the	 65.08163804773923
sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid. O, as true as	 92.27767825950674
I’m telling you. A goodlooking sovereign.	 84.02862432982647
—And there’s more where that came from, says he.	 120.11806335247144
—Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe? says I.	 37.818776100431855
—Sweat of my brow, says Joe. ’Twas the prudent member gave me the	 82.87051784907403
wheeze.	 4.608171674364364
—I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and	 68.19169670151871
Greek street with his cod’s eye counting up all the guts of the fish.	 84.37454524663913
Who comes through Michan’s land, bedight in sable armour? O’Bloom, the	 32.82587169255595
son of Rory: it is he. Impervious to fear is Rory’s son: he of the	 74.7670454667524
prudent soul.	 1971.0202649986359
—For the old woman of Prince’s street, says the citizen, the subsidised	 20.54558356820878
organ. The pledgebound party on the floor of the house. And look at	 39.883262610199104
this blasted rag, says he. Look at this, says he. _The Irish	 72.67870647660467
Independent,_ if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman’s	 55.99668845389622
friend. Listen to the births and deaths in the _Irish all for Ireland	 63.53264031566701
Independent,_ and I’ll thank you and the marriages.	 51.464589310197915
And he starts reading them out:	 39.17786985109471
—Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne’s	 8.811826319830642
on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son. How’s that, eh? Wright	 69.52825539545509
and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the	 38.639829002507746
late George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and	 61.40517713366746
Ridsdale at Saint Jude’s, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest,	 20.741758124632785
dean of Worcester. Eh? Deaths. Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London:	 45.28300954704839
Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the	 38.162635837934154
Moat house, Chepstow...	 40.00375497270854
—I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.	 56.69430379183016
—Cockburn. Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller,	 40.2062999148188
Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning street,	 95.05578900669808
Liverpool, Isabella Helen. How’s that for a national press, eh, my	 145.91514339235087
brown son! How’s that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?	 67.87042389965221
—Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose. Thanks be to God they had	 78.08740519542617
the start of us. Drink that, citizen.	 112.60804568687213
—I will, says he, honourable person.	 45.48492602137327
—Health, Joe, says I. And all down the form.	 141.2055905637311
Ah! Ow! Don’t be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint.	 74.22129285621246
Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.	 37.436571743949074
And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came	 91.52254580122258
swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him	 83.30686558536105
there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred	 98.53391847675714
scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage,	 70.91332003439949
fairest of her race.	 53.29224947487242
Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney’s	 45.55450043944838
snug, squeezed up with the laughing. And who was sitting up there in	 103.35055580776496
the corner that I hadn’t seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob	 142.2952776282594
Doran. I didn’t know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the	 54.62297845493546
door. And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen	 70.51371877526348
in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter	 33.488309701011225
and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting	 39.71674735979738
like a poodle. I thought Alf would split.	 63.62785152355413
—Look at him, says he. Breen. He’s traipsing all round Dublin with a	 54.254287476124645
postcard someone sent him with U. p: up on it to take a li...	 39.6937698456665
And he doubled up.	 33.90163219100155
—Take a what? says I.	 115.15974032217072
—Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.	 42.034427771446666
—O hell! says I.	 83.94852732897529
The bloody mongrel began to growl that’d put the fear of God in you	 47.40950450632826
seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.	 112.70362151011356
_—Bi i dho husht,_ says he.	 23.384877595533066
—Who? says Joe.	 38.342261110299134
—Breen, says Alf. He was in John Henry Menton’s and then he went round	 39.10707632399476
to Collis and Ward’s and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round	 64.7580470043839
to the subsheriff’s for a lark. O God, I’ve a pain laughing. U. p: up.	 45.57822486515976
The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody	 42.60237013990414
old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.	 53.510766626358546
—When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? says Joe.	 93.14311809810025
—Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up. Is that Alf Bergan?	 61.57197426578922
—Yes, says Alf. Hanging? Wait till I show you. Here, Terry, give us a	 27.44125043715354
pony. That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds. You should have seen	 40.4029694916513
long John’s eye. U. p ....	 179.2527239516786
And he started laughing.	 125.54562331744374
—Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran. Is that Bergan?	 41.366826848973105
—Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.	 105.00349791585653
Terence O’Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full	 60.71092077727208
of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and	 41.94488834289634
Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of	 100.32987287199408
deathless Leda. For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and	 10.548452549508447
mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour	 63.30909178962261
juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day	 171.68483641433704
from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.	 30.14236647897898
Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born,	 106.7233171086496
that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that	 49.91961622976885
thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.	 25.651813409075082
But he, the young chief of the O’Bergan’s, could ill brook to be	 47.29968839880991
outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a	 80.59297580915849
testoon of costliest bronze. Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork	 25.100473341812645
was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of	 32.93355950932424
Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of	 110.27248471198122
God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the	 60.240476531745756
British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress	 63.21541732859264
of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the	 65.11558041998103
wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to	 62.117207846832436
the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.	 90.40751304530833
—What’s that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and	 44.557847124796425
down outside?	 715.6597022742804
—What’s that? says Joe.	 35.695106467987806
—Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino. Talking about hanging,	 55.849403468330074
I’ll show you something you never saw. Hangmen’s letters. Look at here.	 68.91222190555108
So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his	 39.602683037791245
pocket.	 14049.948178358825
—Are you codding? says I.	 32.86123153087856
—Honest injun, says Alf. Read them.	 176.13793704707265
So Joe took up the letters.	 70.58728690066694
—Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran.	 38.761634279231075
So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust. Bob’s a queer chap when	 43.4580709568506
the porter’s up in him so says I just to make talk:	 70.79255112207669
—How’s Willy Murray those times, Alf?	 130.02508641295668
—I don’t know, says Alf. I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy	 29.38281396296494
Dignam. Only I was running after that...	 156.45411324919831
—You what? says Joe, throwing down the letters. With who?	 59.65106432787383
—With Dignam, says Alf.	 88.17824676237501
—Is it Paddy? says Joe.	 54.91438656342903
—Yes, says Alf. Why?	 60.370043424868214
—Don’t you know he’s dead? says Joe.	 18.91953930856186
—Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.	 23.42322332481412
—Ay, says Joe.	 24.150064666631376
—Sure I’m after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as	 84.9455700579817
a pikestaff.	 13.400948507362273
—Who’s dead? says Bob Doran.	 62.06956193503584
—You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.	 127.3876852888321
—What? says Alf. Good Christ, only five... What?... And Willy Murray	 100.77731305697183
with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim’s... What? Dignam	 130.5485757326331
dead?	 2339.4292884751385
—What about Dignam? says Bob Doran. Who’s talking about...?	 25.708946873915682
—Dead! says Alf. He’s no more dead than you are.	 31.36400369868442
—Maybe so, says Joe. They took the liberty of burying him this morning	 78.49160438840269
anyhow.	 3821.709697339643
—Paddy? says Alf.	 136.88986946776922
—Ay, says Joe. He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.	 53.04536676062024
—Good Christ! says Alf.	 21.48106260652143
Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted.	 65.51813858094678
In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by	 85.34405149111275
tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing	 43.3528438312868
luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of	 36.93752536606006
the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge	 18.88771568100715
of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face. Communication was	 61.00545081654244
effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the	 38.742966960605166
orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar	 26.545198511921637
plexus. Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the	 16.902233722008425
heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return	 29.900429114672797
but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty	 61.909872152145354
entities on the lower astral levels. In reply to a question as to his	 37.29952463087007
first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously	 52.05558403344386
he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had	 54.929125827658254
summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them.	 29.681482745509015
Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the	 77.95117349547148
flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the	 46.360298348834434
spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort	 139.52938470933273
such as tālāfānā, ālāvātār, hātākāldā, wātāklāsāt and that the highest	 34.514538863808674
adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature.	 45.45993097987065
Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently	 63.213070889015896
afforded relief. Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted	 55.08824120202259
all who were still at the wrong side of Māyā to acknowledge the true	 34.404417796243195
path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were	 34.50427336687311
out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power. It was	 59.61696598539766
then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the	 49.461307271984246
defunct and the reply was: _We greet you, friends of earth, who are	 140.19704236803182
still in the body. Mind C. K. doesn’t pile it on._ It was ascertained	 54.835240432109195
that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H.	 75.26241158781974
J. O’Neill’s popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the	 102.62097685520733
defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment	 18.918663138453784
arrangements. Before departing he requested that it should be told to	 43.84302588354657
his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for	 37.21648819010882
was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair	 56.73209849639017
should be sent to Cullen’s to be soled only as the heels were still	 59.549132415695006
good. He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in	 98.18779017184666
the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made	 110.91150005621654
known.	 8694.732749247476
Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was	 65.17973793170505
intimated that this had given satisfaction.	 70.27574199713568
He is gone from mortal haunts: O’Dignam, sun of our morning. Fleet was	 91.98936399986881
his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow. Wail, Banba, with	 37.843912912262184
your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.	 66.33231566326526
—There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.	 29.151139657383816
—Who? says I.	 54.55936263869861
—Bloom, says he. He’s on point duty up and down there for the last ten	 37.60035309135097
minutes.	 11125.007414326714
And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.	 80.89837803149423
Little Alf was knocked bawways. Faith, he was.	 158.16027084034468
—Good Christ! says he. I could have sworn it was him.	 29.632675233347317
And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest	 44.247086026897314
blackguard in Dublin when he’s under the influence:	 62.70279342210449
—Who said Christ is good?	 149.99736622144016
—I beg your parsnips, says Alf.	 27.149581496813486
—Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy	 24.421476230726253
Dignam?	 2394.6913809619887
—Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off. He’s over all his troubles.	 45.41258855967224
But Bob Doran shouts out of him.	 30.752276198202647
—He’s a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.	 42.81694683437344
Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn’t	 90.54486355083031
want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. And Bob	 67.13447428542716
Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you’re there.	 66.61962291096513
—The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.	 51.41666781271386
The tear is bloody near your eye. Talking through his bloody hat.	 216.24361952976486
Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married,	 39.706721144780374
Mooney, the bumbailiff’s daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke	 79.84556269445781
street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told	 55.83944519579435
me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on	 74.81594497530118
her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.	 88.54803217284561
—The noblest, the truest, says he. And he’s gone, poor little Willy,	 25.429773422612293
poor little Paddy Dignam.	 16.254262616586605
And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that	 31.946328215771306
beam of heaven.	 332.1627199631531
Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round	 122.21089353314964
the door.	 61.531707837923165
—Come in, come on, he won’t eat you, says the citizen.	 50.29558095722992
So Bloom slopes in with his cod’s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was	 53.70994161814774
Martin Cunningham there.	 209.30510472311298
—O, Christ M’Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters. Listen to	 57.66878440334129
this, will you?	 42.97909697794743
And he starts reading out one.	 46.354282115043596
_7 Hunter Street,	 65.17299357237184
Liverpool._	 8441.002597298588
_To the High Sheriff of Dublin,	 61.94226294666139
Dublin._	 1970.3569336792075
_Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful	 23.82893841816424
case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i	 59.7793206453932
hanged..._	 16570.397534869353
—Show us, Joe, says I.	 49.76902873068173
—_... private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in	 67.44452202159579
Pentonville prison and i was assistant when..._	 109.78900268294917
—Jesus, says I.	 103.45817402993912
—_... Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith..._	 11.773014555849272
The citizen made a grab at the letter.	 38.9017637470073
—Hold hard, says Joe, _i have a special nack of putting the noose once	 43.622306016875854
in he can’t get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my	 50.054860944570365
terms is five ginnees._	 305.58056604910945
_H. Rumbold,	 189.79051876670295
Master Barber._	 157.3455770076233
—And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.	 31.7365664014713
—And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. Here, says he, take them	 60.04490230355822
to hell out of my sight, Alf. Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you	 43.76773975136378
have?	 636.7317394657713
So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn’t and	 133.52752359095578
he couldn’t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said	 69.47531156432468
well he’d just take a cigar. Gob, he’s a prudent member and no mistake.	 75.08097882084596
—Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.	 52.361961148856054
And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with	 71.28392792611187
a black border round it.	 92.52070330120769
—They’re all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang	 105.12624665426506
their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.	 31.556418699416703
And he was telling us there’s two fellows waiting below to pull his	 66.05222824779156
heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they	 84.18934783356562
chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.	 85.5200472824769
In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. Their	 35.41917289559409
deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever	 18.539616212669806
wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so	 204.89864841064895
saith the Lord.	 296.674158607456
So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom	 52.60881803232987
comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the	 35.13223051745822
business and the old dog smelling him all the time I’m told those	 64.32533740695214
jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about	 85.71944156921406
I don’t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.	 70.78387246547904
—There’s one thing it hasn’t a deterrent effect on, says Alf.	 79.91432627834473
—What’s that? says Joe.	 35.695106467987806
—The poor bugger’s tool that’s being hanged, says Alf.	 52.22162194744884
—That so? says Joe.	 41.89849100388613
—God’s truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head warder that was in	 43.004624850146
Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He told me when	 29.99540246328018
they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like	 79.27152107692716
a poker.	 13.400948507362273
—Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.	 102.9714614566205
—That can be explained by science, says Bloom. It’s only a natural	 64.9045342275825
phenomenon, don’t you see, because on account of the...	 51.65515165797047
And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science	 48.4644379025539
and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.	 89.01366445149556
The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered	 15.933081303623153
medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the	 36.85868481841238
cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would,	 9.397870541786007
according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be	 76.9075495308216
calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent	 32.94656559357237
ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus,	 10.163550780513292
thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly	 10.399058312230997
dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood	 49.213316661379466
to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ	 44.38932652970367
resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a	 23.271455324618266
morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo	 5.9945942121830145
mortis per diminutionem capitis._	 15.564694731237928
So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and	 45.960737014066346
he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard	 40.26989302587543
and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe	 33.15263419261787
with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported	 51.90682096382038
for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this,	 84.68300401687235
that and the other. Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a	 58.907678443234694
new dog so he ought. Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all	 110.63434651677827
round the place and scratching his scabs. And round he goes to Bob	 57.385238470168076
Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could	 169.90882899866406
get. So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:	 39.77942508217499
—Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw	 65.33660700437134
here! Give us the paw!	 42.63374531032253
Arrah, bloody end to the paw he’d paw and Alf trying to keep him from	 51.069044572188794
tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking	 34.92987074162483
all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and	 34.27222637286975
intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scraping a few	 41.366329203061355
bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs’ tin he told Terry to	 49.490143142873045
bring. Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging	 93.92935974553465
out of him a yard long for more. Near ate the tin and all, hungry	 89.7511077110591
bloody mongrel.	 132.14015411466417
And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the	 63.503042655517476
brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet	 75.04941357611591
and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and	 116.27616830755787
she’s far from the land. And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown	 76.21660561315146
cigar putting on swank with his lardy face. Phenomenon! The fat heap he	 77.3570059013867
married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley.	 66.68189226979817
Time they were stopping up in the _City Arms_ pisser Burke told me	 12.22969014399961
there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and	 32.00897148753342
Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing	 42.49456176201407
bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating	 44.866139363467504
meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and	 95.95115285604716
taking the lout out for a walk. And one time he led him the rounds of	 53.193712741531066
Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought	 67.45635435996135
him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him	 37.27419105598905
the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn’t near	 70.23780035856105
roast him, it’s a queer story, the old one, Bloom’s wife and Mrs O’Dowd	 86.33092218979583
that kept the hotel. Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them	 45.974324771465355
off chewing the fat. And Bloom with his _but don’t you see?_ and _but	 100.0866869095426
on the other hand_. And sure, more be token, the lout I’m told was in	 68.1500734567058
Power’s after, the blender’s, round in Cope street going home footless	 104.08350258286242
in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the	 64.7531670489836
samples in the bloody establishment. Phenomenon!	 34.10179112071084
—The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and	 20.163963521082405
glaring at Bloom.	 41.00389845073836
—Ay, ay, says Joe.	 15.975993613511077
—You don’t grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is...	 60.422984763735
—_Sinn Fein!_ says the citizen. _Sinn Fein amhain!_ The friends we love	 29.376758402447233
are by our side and the foes we hate before us.	 119.07054665668392
The last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far	 22.471347682084147
and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the	 32.185238777854465
gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums	 99.6219243869749
punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening	 20.16092697396502
claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the	 64.70854298331146
ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its	 54.58139290603641
supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. A torrential rain	 54.65052643124716
poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared	 44.056120446514406
heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest	 44.2575354916459
computation five hundred thousand persons. A posse of Dublin	 16.09951061498756
Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person	 55.65977330865725
maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and	 72.49846705163256
reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on	 31.143757546302556
their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from	 16.00405394058632
the cradle by Speranza’s plaintive muse. Special quick excursion trains	 35.75439895800279
and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our	 31.492043993570878
country cousins of whom there were large contingents. Considerable	 71.86149607408362
amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and	 26.192409526407484
M-ll-g-n who sang _The Night before Larry was stretched_ in their usual	 82.09866865535437
mirth-provoking fashion. Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade	 117.88233886885749
with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody	 35.76729564040933
who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will	 74.91579472781416
grudge them their hardearned pennies. The children of the Male and	 95.531125677267
Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the	 91.4351294409188
scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day’s	 31.534816081412476
entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the	 26.699883306808378
Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and	 51.60500411644437
motherless children a genuinely instructive treat. The viceregal	 78.61237767804134
houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their	 66.35771515556918
Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while	 17.013933031485656
the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald	 48.248603180032305
Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite. The delegation,	 110.0794570135939
present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone	 34.084826563791296
(the semiparalysed _doyen_ of the party who had to be assisted to his	 17.831581827150988
seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul	 67.23253247298699
Petitépatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the	 7.394726499526912

delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest	 32.92641445901721
possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which	 71.89442037116167
they had been called upon to witness. An animated altercation (in which	 48.0071122171789
all took part) ensued among the F. O. T. E. I. as to whether the eighth	 101.6410243646877
or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland’s	 38.134199920450214
patron saint. In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars,	 47.6141065732229
boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas,	 3.933542382544028
catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to	 37.33618582318117
and blows were freely exchanged. The baby policeman, Constable	 86.30120094551448
MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly	 46.547575319612825
restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth	 31.042393576769303
of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending	 59.70882599784423
parties. The readywitted ninefooter’s suggestion at once appealed to	 11.90320071062035
all and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden was heartily	 156.2968265520394
congratulated by all the F. O. T. E. I., several of whom were bleeding	 84.12403181647029
profusely. Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from	 18.58921188704487
underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal	 23.367013446415335
adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his	 16.586926919975376
thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the	 41.554103171877145
pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their	 95.8871392857291
senses. The objects (which included several hundred ladies’ and	 53.40134852767591
gentlemen’s gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their	 52.39273589958634
rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.	 9.917226639605412
Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless	 39.813035095080444
morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the _Gladiolus	 93.96855984686324
Cruentus_. He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough	 109.55012587307999
which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate—short, painstaking	 46.58180303033559
yet withal so characteristic of the man. The arrival of the	 37.999792706042975
worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the	 24.585766185642974
huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in	 103.45622048545565
their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates	 134.76898984153146
cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, _hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio,	 9.333329573129548
chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah_, amid which the ringing	 20.47609367392612
_evviva_ of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling	 27.895802709562847
those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani	 134.62610664376416
beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable. It	 70.59011993934793
was exactly seventeen o’clock. The signal for prayer was then promptly	 103.35455784660675
given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the	 76.30817928764465
commendatore’s patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession	 11.92399835319233
of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his	 33.41075358270849
medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi. The learned prelate who	 111.81294841950206
administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when	 37.23136844228063
about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a	 89.88839826479428
pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to	 26.4408643798551
the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication. Hard by the block	 93.44269422326869
stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in	 39.58049891386163
a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which	 39.87501975554942
his eyes glowered furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal he tested	 24.367185027555287
the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or	 44.02983899753156
decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been	 23.792479768363815
provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office. On a	 65.98536979514208
handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering	 88.61807012009389
knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially	 26.778039992888438
supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and	 80.04786324128175
Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the	 14.629982610290677
duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully	 41.54422565406117
extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most	 23.622133573885318
precious blood of the most precious victim. The housesteward of the	 12.800533312710517
amalgamated cats’ and dogs’ home was in attendance to convey these	 49.25112454215319
vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution. Quite an	 191.20150521760678
excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and	 27.96917545918918
onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and	 88.40593543786177
invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for	 45.81679345050091
the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital	 19.935959270100046
spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the	 57.28732780506451
proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in	 68.46983114723017
these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying	 139.30564946928837
wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in	 51.1059058958027
aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers’	 36.71498178411911
association as a token of his regard and esteem. The _nec_ and _non	 17.794744961457685
plus ultra_ of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst	 83.50485806909282
her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself	 33.533819950706246
upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into	 44.16615835259727
eternity for her sake. The hero folded her willowy form in a loving	 112.4430719603479
embrace murmuring fondly _Sheila, my own_. Encouraged by this use of	 58.47707683047723
her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable	 65.94106975321613
areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her	 35.673949166999975
ardour to reach. She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of	 32.916906744229955
their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would	 73.43250319180571
never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips	 87.7716962870394
as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park. She	 64.56664707948876
brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood	 83.99354476282093
together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the	 27.579802654922975
innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present,	 74.63912886402639
they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable	 30.78097857121021
pastor, joining in the general merriment. That monster audience simply	 24.85762467539876
rocked with delight. But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped	 46.001397685813515
their hands for the last time. A fresh torrent of tears burst from	 75.30955973685688
their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the	 38.428571810613235
inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being	 52.19127671051417
the aged prebendary himself. Big strong men, officers of the peace and	 80.5440686660372
genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of	 37.265462092453916
their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye	 46.9619883751764
in that record assemblage. A most romantic incident occurred when a	 28.03860523792695
handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair	 57.061037130747074
sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and	 74.01913367242084
genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady,	 64.98036053729236
requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot. Every	 89.61722528186306
lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the	 20.29201949898951
occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and	 30.47328768984447
generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the	 91.23649769729329
gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most	 45.94388704685383
timehonoured names in Albion’s history) placed on the finger of his	 67.63233209781868
blushing _fiancée_ an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in	 91.93516742064632
the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. Nay,	 73.10102266237014
even the stern provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell	 15.739961064370002
ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had	 33.15817846148993
blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without	 50.112588806738565
flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion. With his mailed	 47.19956439025941
gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those	 35.18562132932087
privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate _entourage,_ to	 20.983376783911694
murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:	 49.65326232808387
—God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart. Blimey it	 52.967578682975095
makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause	 127.85649597155465
I thinks of my old mashtub what’s waiting for me down Limehouse way.	 72.71325767865756
So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the	 36.20380668100329
corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can’t speak	 67.19228543559139
their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a	 99.89860456650536
quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he	 39.244199440936114
cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the	 44.39351843554624
antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland. Antitreating is	 109.71174731363773
about the size of it. Gob, he’d let you pour all manner of drink down	 106.69860638841868
his throat till the Lord would call him before you’d ever see the froth	 114.18119337491838
of his pint. And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their	 82.30015305818405
musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of	 49.351545831249275
hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly	 67.25893046277696
blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen	 39.106953398316215
bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and	 62.17697481167415
oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh	 33.41300453933864
entertainment, don’t be talking. Ireland sober is Ireland free. And	 244.38424834332847
then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers	 30.59585474964187
shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. And one or two	 80.1115007195314
sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the	 113.30581200999771
females, hitting below the belt.	 288.0411920648761
So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty	 56.538728359060045
starts mousing around by Joe and me. I’d train him by kindness, so I	 122.4533106094878
would, if he was my dog. Give him a rousing fine kick now and again	 72.15011492856318
where it wouldn’t blind him.	 170.7032049765522
—Afraid he’ll bite you? says the citizen, jeering.	 37.79719525492009
—No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost.	 38.72245903215962
So he calls the old dog over.	 61.082062229396485
—What’s on you, Garry? says he.	 57.635004846228334
Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the	 33.96836414971074
old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera.	 49.951793957945476
Such growling you never heard as they let off between them. Someone	 138.08618240204402
that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter _pro bono	 40.310108911511364
publico_ to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of	 51.91797143620681
that. Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth	 70.90016373464897
is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.	 46.868708356189
All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the	 37.49034792195597
lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not	 109.84479162438878
missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the	 28.75150697701458
famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _sobriquet_	 56.61019665724525
of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends	 72.60053378613401
and acquaintances Owen Garry. The exhibition, which is the result of	 30.776123406617018
years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary	 40.26245879182524
system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse.	 100.29533647836269
Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from	 116.96532158473569
us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and	 53.91127639505005
compare the verse recited and has found it bears a _striking_	 83.77389252387688
resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic	 18.00115796004638
bards. We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with	 34.05945191457918
which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym	 28.650789563733984
of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but	 53.09325206092967
rather (as a contributor D. O. C. points out in an interesting	 112.83070405739568
communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and	 21.017800008351426
more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the	 21.881260711478713
famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more	 50.500291842223035
modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye. We subjoin a	 106.88019637472208
specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar	 45.75464325086307
whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we	 86.03661662556661
believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more	 96.71080962725796
than an indication. The metrical system of the canine original, which	 50.12399772248535
recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh	 9.631158864352301
englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will	 64.08362539221076
agree that the spirit has been well caught. Perhaps it should be added	 66.30552848510962
that the effect is greatly increased if Owen’s verse be spoken somewhat	 127.69377109906887
slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.	 25.343419704252835
The curse of my curses	 22.806757129099843
Seven days every day	 103.08141078786115
And seven dry Thursdays	 101.01418352826259
On you, Barney Kiernan,	 123.70830410217434
Has no sup of water	 129.9353927007223
To cool my courage,	 162.34039851304922
And my guts red roaring	 111.94010013417396
After Lowry’s lights.	 391.9695045960599
So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could	 114.40659305450833
hear him lapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he have	 98.71512971832874
another.	 1728.7368959135488
—I will, says he, _a chara_, to show there’s no ill feeling.	 68.67506434939682
Gob, he’s not as green as he’s cabbagelooking. Arsing around from one	 136.0645520301102
pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap’s dog	 119.48794792972461
and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. Entertainment for	 35.601222657619545
man and beast. And says Joe:	 107.7960296064123
—Could you make a hole in another pint?	 82.07368593671204
—Could a swim duck? says I.	 120.62780808057826
—Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you won’t have anything in	 43.01082388693764
the way of liquid refreshment? says he.	 45.39079853212992
—Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet	 27.891160368682076
Martin Cunningham, don’t you see, about this insurance of poor	 73.77472107934244
Dignam’s. Martin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam, I	 131.3130923473286
mean, didn’t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the	 56.570584650375125
time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can’t recover on the	 47.06403047246979
policy.	 19463.627878772
—Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that’s a good one if old Shylock is	 79.02470693967669
landed. So the wife comes out top dog, what?	 228.28876081349568
—Well, that’s a point, says Bloom, for the wife’s admirers.	 43.754109073473366
—Whose admirers? says Joe.	 67.20417349324497
—The wife’s advisers, I mean, says Bloom.	 22.162822819294995
Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act	 55.28493726695194
like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit	 46.88422677000007
of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that	 71.1955184421453
Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow	 104.80399957582578
contested the mortgagee’s right till he near had the head of me addled	 61.84721749564634
with his mortgagor under the act. He was bloody safe he wasn’t run in	 51.37897933352927
himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a	 44.66910614717932
friend in court. Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal	 54.16386751931536
Hungarian privileged lottery. True as you’re there. O, commend me to an	 159.54864425364838
israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.	 66.1587727582061
So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he	 157.4501270773404
was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and	 48.633333017264306
to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was	 50.32648325165213
never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that’s dead to tell her.	 67.16947689710929
Choking with bloody foolery. And shaking Bloom’s hand doing the tragic	 75.07647391579175
to tell her that. Shake hands, brother. You’re a rogue and I’m another.	 70.40829184587207
—Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however	 108.52670130552644
slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is	 98.69052485013258
founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to	 56.55819188190246
request of you this favour. But, should I have overstepped the limits	 68.5658444004226
of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my	 69.292162925676
boldness.	 4.608171674364364
—No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which	 55.52672766718488
actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me	 65.09177443780595
consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow,	 56.3783767386993
this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness	 58.612217463781214
of the cup.	 120.28424769534607
—Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. The goodness of your heart,	 93.22096839702886
I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the	 60.18512344515253
expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose	 42.6762439736631
poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of	 59.90438094197879
speech.	 3407.4500722452353
And off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five	 69.24916959200335
o’clock. Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the	 101.6768371588314
bobby, 14A. Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after	 35.876146692110964
closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard,	 60.9603901734862
drinking porter out of teacups. And calling himself a Frenchy for the	 51.22467449895387
shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he	 62.6811461653668
serving mass in Adam and Eve’s when he was young with his eyes shut,	 48.48893000943243
who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and	 22.93750050082872
smugging. And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his	 47.16464317246059
pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed	 48.505520315748356
and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another. _How is your	 62.82138193927002
testament? Have you got an old testament?_ Only Paddy was passing	 62.35630096327036
there, I tell you what. Then see him of a Sunday with his little	 99.06110998343077
concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the	 26.02663106481454
chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as	 117.72540741765965
pie, doing the little lady. Jack Mooney’s sister. And the old	 150.67758444000455
prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples. Gob, Jack	 109.55642111525046
made him toe the line. Told him if he didn’t patch up the pot, Jesus,	 100.73157092801259
he’d kick the shite out of him.	 42.14116899275269
So Terry brought the three pints.	 49.71350889273385
—Here, says Joe, doing the honours. Here, citizen.	 58.61004353535061
—_Slan leat_, says he.	 16.2030734916839
—Fortune, Joe, says I. Good health, citizen.	 53.657621443975074
Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. Want a small	 110.07352125433411
fortune to keep him in drinks.	 79.14481353442139
—Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe.	 44.41742399222085
—Friend of yours, says Alf.	 85.05852803010835
—Nannan? says Joe. The mimber?	 15.890750193354338
—I won’t mention any names, says Alf.	 60.686908141570676
—I thought so, says Joe. I saw him up at that meeting now with William	 52.41689904579741
Field, M. P., the cattle traders.	 100.75248688482137
—Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of	 17.331366881030355
all countries and the idol of his own.	 15.043933186983
So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and	 32.65772469703839
the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen	 61.79512950992362
sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his	 48.929375415375375
sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the	 14.905213390808989
guaranteed remedy for timber tongue. Because he was up one time in a	 80.35856785024502
knacker’s yard. Walking about with his book and pencil here’s my head	 67.89908560651294
and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot	 61.83618291592202
for giving lip to a grazier. Mister Knowall. Teach your grandmother how	 130.60203714658743
to milk ducks. Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used	 47.40127411936416
to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O’Dowd crying her eyes out	 79.77080030884126
with her eight inches of fat all over her. Couldn’t loosen her farting	 60.4941212237
strings but old cod’s eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do	 135.79762842379589
it. What’s your programme today? Ay. Humane methods. Because the poor	 86.0090187166786
animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn’t	 156.64695397960148
cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently. Gob,	 168.67085549087838
he’d have a soft hand under a hen.	 44.39818835334329
Ga Ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Black Liz is our hen. She lays eggs for	 59.592019592216566
us. When she lays her egg she is so glad. Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Then	 82.84786307970799
comes good uncle Leo. He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her	 93.13338912728483
fresh egg. Ga ga ga ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook.	 13.145451756164418
—Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London	 131.22958753292545
to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons.	 29.70014281364489
—Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going? I wanted to see	 55.0811033021369
him, as it happens.	 57.706946583113286
—Well, he’s going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.	 61.60256171362071
—That’s too bad, says Bloom. I wanted particularly. Perhaps only Mr	 106.64653172866183
Field is going. I couldn’t phone. No. You’re sure?	 186.7055780671265
—Nannan’s going too, says Joe. The league told him to ask a question	 60.899594638623284
tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the	 32.25839808746706
park. What do you think of that, citizen? _The Sluagh na h-Eireann_.	 44.89150202080636
Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham. Nat.): Arising out of the question of my	 18.3643788333483
honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right	 230.87195396361727
honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that	 160.3555595396311
these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is	 87.76075173725481
forthcoming as to their pathological condition?	 73.03237814424428
Mr Allfours (Tamoshant. Con.): Honourable members are already in	 43.08328482934213
possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole	 38.348854109895115
house. I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that. The answer to the	 81.64310491802637
honourable member’s question is in the affirmative.	 55.52396545094052
Mr Orelli O’Reilly (Montenotte. Nat.): Have similar orders been issued	 24.68610618867818
for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the	 32.211739423373956
Phoenix park?	 101.0377147942557
Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.	 33.767954370603164
Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman’s famous	 64.54043964917442
Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury	 65.27943558507785
bench? (O! O!)	 321.7802342493597
Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.	 90.93287575253656
Mr Staylewit (Buncombe. Ind.): Don’t hesitate to shoot.	 45.16841510489173
(Ironical opposition cheers.)	 48.06315306948407
The speaker: Order! Order!	 114.7186558535769
(The house rises. Cheers.)	 209.28884550172424
—There’s the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival. There	 70.75430714522341
he is sitting there. The man that got away James Stephens. The champion	 31.214058084376394
of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot. What was your best	 167.69548114786713
throw, citizen?	 4688.612999963501
—_Na bacleis_, says the citizen, letting on to be modest. There was a	 17.923776473646186
time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.	 72.38748042225878
—Put it there, citizen, says Joe. You were and a bloody sight better.	 58.3354839555245
—Is that really a fact? says Alf.	 38.61383828418658
—Yes, says Bloom. That’s well known. Did you not know that?	 54.08947203078563
So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of	 163.02460166581812
lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil	 67.36122494070038
and building up a nation once again and all to that. And of course	 80.05861930685562
Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower’s heart	 135.5352939815025
violent exercise was bad. I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a	 63.76836809472575
straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: _Look at, Bloom.	 60.05153454748532
Do you see that straw? That’s a straw_. Declare to my aunt he’d talk	 74.9309267359265
about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.	 97.73622457894389
A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of _Brian	 56.51662501543988
O’Ciarnain’s_ in _Sraid na Bretaine Bheag_, under the auspices of	 14.087571712917478
_Sluagh na h-Eireann_, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the	 14.837325350402818
importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and	 23.70844632604925
ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race. The	 56.62441618857552
venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the	 50.31343636219266
attendance was of large dimensions. After an instructive discourse by	 177.27972024183467
the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed,	 16.413101503055945
a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high	 63.61519730465028
standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the	 18.790347188295627
revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic	 29.95194565591025
forefathers. The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of	 35.43786406221258
our old tongue, Mr Joseph M’Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for	 121.80104474181414
the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised	 10.081656907320765
morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best	 56.13333606041934
traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient	 56.545585516489396
ages. L. Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses,	 89.44535825924032
having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the	 25.583141984859864
discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty	 70.01184973632452
plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy	 19.561095003678314
rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis’ evergreen verses	 12.133728212320928
(happily too familiar to need recalling here) _A nation once again_ in	 80.51617933884322
the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without	 27.478162950701485
fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself. The Irish	 60.64654698485676
Caruso-Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were	 63.58862598939636
heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only	 32.59293663955163
our citizen can sing it. His superb highclass vocalism, which by its	 80.34621833031821
superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was	 68.57812068766778
vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be	 38.62962062670346
noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives	 61.17744174758477
of the press and the bar and the other learned professions. The	 29.186229720433566
proceedings then terminated.	 21.535099427554933
Amongst the clergy present were the very rev. William Delany, S. J., L.	 35.475013165501274
L. D.; the rt rev. Gerald Molloy, D. D.; the rev. P. J. Kavanagh, C. S.	 47.200536671542714

P. J. Cleary, O. S. F.; the rev. L. J. Hickey, O. P.; the very rev. Fr.	 44.10140907188782
Nicholas, O. S. F. C.; the very rev. B. Gorman, O. D. C.; the rev. T.	 28.715535528794977

M’Manus, V. G.; the rev. B. R. Slattery, O. M. I.; the very rev. M. D.	 57.087728237230046
Scally, P. P.; the rev. F. T. Purcell, O. P.; the very rev. Timothy	 25.668179031953986
canon Gorman, P. P.; the rev. J. Flanagan, C. C. The laity included P.	 58.68827321661865
Fay, T. Quirke, etc., etc.	 79.22836336862366
—Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that	 68.66043169237672
Keogh-Bennett match?	 203.41496485887677
—No, says Joe.	 38.06188908327061
—I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.	 77.90197230308611
—Who? Blazes? says Joe.	 156.38215412856772
And says Bloom:	 58.22098791805466
—What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training	 44.950347743726965
the eye.	 114.21677761578141
—Ay, Blazes, says Alf. He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up	 89.92363910321649
the odds and he swatting all the time.	 24.064286270314586
—We know him, says the citizen. The traitor’s son. We know what put	 48.939653075431316
English gold in his pocket.	 102.24995281328783
—True for you, says Joe.	 55.315014338844186
And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the	 28.674906726736676
blood, asking Alf:	 1026.9133912943917
—Now, don’t you think, Bergan?	 47.6181544697677
—Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf. Heenan and Sayers was only	 90.7404054679264
a bloody fool to it. Handed him the father and mother of a beating. See	 75.33241909251133
the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. God,	 55.31352039864672
he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made	 75.25972398458018
him puke what he never ate.	 88.91029256262122
It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were	 21.64557233154333
scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns.	 86.0267412144908
Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin’s pet lamb made up	 36.94637465280335
for it by superlative skill in ringcraft. The final bout of fireworks	 41.089128693921246
was a gruelling for both champions. The welterweight sergeantmajor had	 33.037959077138105
tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had	 81.28550272818543
been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in	 48.27602346702998
some neat work on the pet’s nose, and Myler came on looking groggy. The	 86.07133632744717
soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which	 182.42585579680636
the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the	 44.69625021215958
point of Bennett’s jaw. The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him	 43.922513603045445
with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one. The men came to	 111.23968416973973
handigrips. Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout	 94.50553845654389
ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him. The	 33.12221981378515
Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he	 213.39367078484173
was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey	 80.50045324653831
and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in	 27.931917130670097
jigtime. It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it. The two	 41.60616029483862
fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high. The referee twice	 195.27102158703826
cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his	 51.513695731145035
footwork a treat to watch. After a brisk exchange of courtesies during	 71.41663100908622
which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from	 80.73561951634295
his opponent’s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and	 76.15976895959571
landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett’s stomach, flooring him	 109.37952876938859
flat. It was a knockout clean and clever. Amid tense expectation the	 67.17683775942425
Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett’s second Ole	 64.5873532433031
Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared	 23.49535722313475
victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the	 38.27281697941655
ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.	 19.12070574462881
—He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf. I hear he’s	 93.3882041767395
running a concert tour now up in the north.	 84.6456772428667
—He is, says Joe. Isn’t he?	 29.175969465326347
—Who? says Bloom. Ah, yes. That’s quite true. Yes, a kind of summer	 44.546115869114324
tour, you see. Just a holiday.	 119.25397328654651
—Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isn’t she? says Joe.	 187.71598097063963
—My wife? says Bloom. She’s singing, yes. I think it will be a success	 43.31758980718848
too. He’s an excellent man to organise. Excellent.	 148.14947858536792
Hoho begob says I to myself says I. That explains the milk in the	 63.09367672271633
cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal’s chest. Blazes doing the	 49.85461894040799
tootle on the flute. Concert tour. Dirty Dan the dodger’s son off	 52.92732943658407
Island bridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to	 91.42780277488875
fight the Boers. Old Whatwhat. I called about the poor and water rate,	 68.71415698364531
Mr Boylan. You what? The water rate, Mr Boylan. You whatwhat? That’s	 100.52194812268698
the bucko that’ll organise her, take my tip. ’Twixt me and you	 110.63347057487627
Caddareesh.	 4.608171674364364
Pride of Calpe’s rocky mount, the ravenhaired daughter of Tweedy. There	 62.81480150597594
grew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air. The	 131.92697170844667
gardens of Alameda knew her step: the garths of olives knew and bowed.	 115.3197792228167
The chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms.	 38.71962817753034
And lo, there entered one of the clan of the O’Molloy’s, a comely hero	 40.022867002236964
of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty’s counsel learned	 171.2061194298701
in the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of	 42.07337809116656
Lambert.	 22285.128993272494
—Hello, Ned.	 228.2676043509998
—Hello, Alf.	 200.44955756955417
—Hello, Jack.	 61.614736031184805
—Hello, Joe.	 190.48368774614022
—God save you, says the citizen.	 25.94133643002477
—Save you kindly, says J. J. What’ll it be, Ned?	 78.52957530668861
—Half one, says Ned.	 176.30080497206694
So J. J. ordered the drinks.	 88.06165398116512
—Were you round at the court? says Joe.	 125.74488822271475
—Yes, says J. J. He’ll square that, Ned, says he.	 53.24055452795512
—Hope so, says Ned.	 180.21762614083303
Now what were those two at? J. J. getting him off the grand jury list	 93.55926782701378
and the other give him a leg over the stile. With his name in Stubbs’s.	 44.745585264205246
Playing cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their	 43.828254159533124
eye, adrinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee	 28.375385505319095
orders. Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where	 63.813285975907306
no-one would know him in the private office when I was there with	 68.63530735305731
Pisser releasing his boots out of the pop. What’s your name, sir?	 174.7329658263831
Dunne, says he. Ay, and done says I. Gob, he’ll come home by weeping	 72.0455487951993
cross one of those days, I’m thinking.	 142.65722200507534
—Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there? says Alf. U. p: up.	 41.47147674212513
—Yes, says J. J. Looking for a private detective.	 27.227243369324544
—Ay, says Ned. And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only	 76.64739993359538
Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting	 50.28033390781452
examined first.	 102.47852746953775
—Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing. God, I’d give anything to	 26.84114326666986
hear him before a judge and jury.	 277.4899868005325
—Was it you did it, Alf? says Joe. The truth, the whole truth and	 65.11001292701035
nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.	 91.9298617439529
—Me? says Alf. Don’t cast your nasturtiums on my character.	 58.294528062886734
—Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence	 129.54808659476353
against you.	 359.7202610295746
—Of course an action would lie, says J. J. It implies that he is not	 57.611235126620386
_compos mentis_. U. p: up.	 11.753961891844376
_—Compos_ your eye! says Alf, laughing. Do you know that he’s balmy?	 29.49987351804508
Look at his head. Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat	 42.59480761321115
on with a shoehorn.	 32.08905950199012
—Yes, says J. J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an	 34.29189332235224
indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.	 31.891289340256513
—Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.	 356.16016314461893
—Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.	 49.01391219940583
—Pity about her, says the citizen. Or any other woman marries a half	 76.58284691970577
and half.	 159.32190835664582
—How half and half? says Bloom. Do you mean he...	 106.14509110475333
—Half and half I mean, says the citizen. A fellow that’s neither fish	 91.23844570083256
nor flesh.	 2741.419749173748
—Nor good red herring, says Joe.	 186.61181377870858
—That what’s I mean, says the citizen. A pishogue, if you know what	 26.315064970012635
that is.	 51.661156938822074
Begob I saw there was trouble coming. And Bloom explaining he meant on	 93.89245881572313
account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old	 62.70414203930644
stuttering fool. Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody	 86.94347125984156
povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him,	 101.4285898718507
bringing down the rain. And she with her nose cockahoop after she	 100.77781180674134
married him because a cousin of his old fellow’s was pewopener to the	 59.444559563502
pope. Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney’s	 28.749683667806682
moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal	 19.80770179596815
Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street.	 46.19746106554454
And who was he, tell us? A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven	 115.33469956469979
shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding	 65.97504736201499
defiance to the world.	 24.01479440246768
—And moreover, says J. J., a postcard is publication. It was held to be	 45.16344770332651
sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v. Hole. In my	 42.84383069492004
opinion an action might lie.	 455.56476856823105
Six and eightpence, please. Who wants your opinion? Let us drink our	 192.11336318342512
pints in peace. Gob, we won’t be let even do that much itself.	 365.5339122190054
—Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.	 87.34089718051163
—Good health, Ned, says J. J.	 34.985682653607114
—-There he is again, says Joe.	 33.22665173515735
—Where? says Alf.	 90.55218741605569
And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter	 42.63619881315651
and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in	 54.72970301807895
as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a	 40.03204673066842
secondhand coffin.	 227.58106810629806
—How did that Canada swindle case go off? says Joe.	 98.04227762748482
—Remanded, says J. J.	 12.713447775112144
One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James	 39.278461116065266
Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers	 18.596238511296477
saying he’d give a passage to Canada for twenty bob. What? Do you see	 70.35766195422049
any green in the white of my eye? Course it was a bloody barney. What?	 92.55290288877674
Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and	 31.36294725980405
his own kidney too. J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew	 63.5939303188332
Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him,	 24.972708313647505
swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.	 35.79875618113925
—Who tried the case? says Joe.	 46.59938611336218
—Recorder, says Ned.	 191.06183179764193
—Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.	 50.429617712750805
—Heart as big as a lion, says Ned. Tell him a tale of woe about arrears	 39.409445363199396
of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he’ll dissolve	 84.5251570928236
in tears on the bench.	 114.11639662116065
—Ay, says Alf. Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn’t clap him in the dock	 24.308101882583134
the other day for suing poor little Gumley that’s minding stones, for	 60.87143225845357
the corporation there near Butt bridge.	 53.424383840264
And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:	 36.490581409127266
—A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children?	 72.05825840188707
Ten, did you say?	 275.89270309849235
—Yes, your worship. And my wife has the typhoid.	 40.03222543701242
—And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court	 113.12040686941803
immediately, sir. No, sir, I’ll make no order for payment. How dare	 57.21439000772604
you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor	 83.25562481984115
hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.	 41.36371460520675
And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and	 16.868637724040365
in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity,	 34.193465894814054
the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first	 70.92069703074358
quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the	 67.54412712048997
halls of law. There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave	 111.42853321260984
his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the	 63.97213077044405
probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first	 25.629308323265686
chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and	 37.2025992861958
final testamentary disposition _in re_ the real and personal estate of	 104.69220665906992
the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus	 74.58718016116919
Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another. And to the solemn	 62.83008356482894
court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer. And he sat	 94.34529956518077
him there about the hour of five o’clock to administer the law of the	 42.184547344917306
brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in	 31.435543702691533
and for the county of the city of Dublin. And there sat with him the	 39.0029745961766
high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of	 50.35400012184497
the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen	 38.72848333723173
and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of	 11.363884590633573
Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the	 10.152178804970509
tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte	 21.22151863439903
and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and	 51.16867129170746
true. And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should	 76.31907796172104
well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined	 140.31111326825703
between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and	 49.69177856627406
true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss	 109.59923181014666
the book. And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they	 56.3113066217356
swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His	 67.08862881922794
rightwiseness. And straightway the minions of the law led forth from	 18.398042724356568
their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended	 84.68521261404865
in consequence of information received. And they shackled him hand and	 65.39081284654077
foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge	 95.24017285929372
against him for he was a malefactor.	 34.51518506995912
—Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland	 69.61117934015628
filling the country with bugs.	 34.41620708657846
So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe,	 108.94518551385599
telling him he needn’t trouble about that little matter till the first	 66.09968937051698
but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford. And so Joe swore high	 62.09560668091682
and holy by this and by that he’d do the devil and all.	 138.80559633630486
—Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have	 44.95797302562813
repetition. That’s the whole secret.	 59.13158559043372
—Rely on me, says Joe.	 39.0285341665054
—Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland. We	 26.589576059584093
want no more strangers in our house.	 70.41230048677916
—O, I’m sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom. It’s just that	 52.06234903084962
Keyes, you see.	 112.91021402419388
—Consider that done, says Joe.	 36.38639595907807
—Very kind of you, says Bloom.	 79.44664248063881
—The strangers, says the citizen. Our own fault. We let them come in.	 45.001034791304654
We brought them in. The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon	 44.366502522545446
robbers here.	 85.12154925584635
—Decree _nisi,_ says J. J.	 10.515511818406702
And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a	 51.45058051272023
spider’s web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling	 23.467639217812334
after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite	 55.99220329317955
and when.	 82.9685664972733
—A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that’s what’s the cause of all	 34.743957639284666
our misfortunes.	 51.573586308667316
—And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the _Police Gazette_	 63.06921036631843
with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.	 106.1089632177056
—Give us a squint at her, says I.	 44.352920039569874
And what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows	 40.84738324924594
off of Corny Kelleher. Secrets for enlarging your private parts.	 96.39501337190727
Misconduct of society belle. Norman W. Tupper, wealthy Chicago	 12.948468588618415
contractor, finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor.	 75.308593412715
Belle in her bloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling	 91.14373609195621
for her tickles and Norman W. Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter	 22.118491209143407
just in time to be late after she doing the trick of the loop with	 66.91251115482817
officer Taylor.	 155.66557456959447
—O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is!	 79.48667734241072
—There’s hair, Joe, says I. Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off	 57.678615936644775
of that one, what?	 99.31059815403933
So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on	 82.55179760632716
him as long as a late breakfast.	 65.933630471358
—Well, says the citizen, what’s the latest from the scene of action?	 36.621163999420865
What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide	 41.20468631766752
about the Irish language?	 43.919956693107345
O’Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the	 75.1222605537094
puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of	 126.45307763770496
that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient	 49.56452353971518
city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there,	 73.72675946611434
after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken	 62.22291343334033
solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once	 173.1832861694817
more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided	 80.90854539430633
Gael.	 4.608171674364364
—It’s on the march, says the citizen. To hell with the bloody brutal	 50.68219717339968
Sassenachs and their _patois._	 12.99207017921306
So J. J. puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till	 56.39543680665049
you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting	 88.5711599681347
your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to	 41.940437988179035
impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and	 57.92157035647296
botheration and their colonies and their civilisation.	 13.663117645101675
—Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. To hell with them!	 34.63302171549334
The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody	 42.43447553402902
thicklugged sons of whores’ gets! No music and no art and no literature	 106.09251167069267
worthy of the name. Any civilisation they have they stole from us.	 94.81754826519887
Tonguetied sons of bastards’ ghosts.	 48.68576738184029
—The European family, says J. J....	 33.304817084261394
—They’re not European, says the citizen. I was in Europe with Kevin	 55.55080860575606
Egan of Paris. You wouldn’t see a trace of them or their language	 125.10721245380262
anywhere in Europe except in a _cabinet d’aisance._	 35.94892093354669
And says John Wyse:	 26.88725818393974
—Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.	 111.20297141315794
And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:	 29.196628161541476
—_Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion!_	 12.105489264843277
He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the	 67.53677405413997
medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan _Lamh	 22.101456257261155
Dearg Abu_, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty	 38.89274064784194
valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster	 24.631950622308572
silent as the deathless gods.	 146.15684209003683
—What’s up with you, says I to Lenehan. You look like a fellow that had	 72.9996745845625
lost a bob and found a tanner.	 129.35783718512587
—Gold cup, says he.	 94.08842944747086
—Who won, Mr Lenehan? says Terry.	 198.05397337634292
_—Throwaway,_ says he, at twenty to one. A rank outsider. And the rest	 156.47758178194854
nowhere.	 4.608171674364364
—And Bass’s mare? says Terry.	 120.30749060079845
—Still running, says he. We’re all in a cart. Boylan plunged two quid	 81.74759782110618
on my tip _Sceptre_ for himself and a lady friend.	 69.27841593175474
—I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on _Zinfandel_ that Mr Flynn	 113.5504432073924
gave me. Lord Howard de Walden’s.	 84.98975064469823
—Twenty to one, says Lenehan. Such is life in an outhouse. _Throwaway,_	 263.730160359028
says he. Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions. Frailty, thy	 55.54137560374261
name is _Sceptre._	 186.41252758679096
So he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was	 35.52277292874907
anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his	 57.91280118397498
luck with his mangy snout up. Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.	 75.52783178587148
—Not there, my child, says he.	 117.22828626187493
—Keep your pecker up, says Joe. She’d have won the money only for the	 92.60219395137204
other dog.	 1021.4899354913349
And J. J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom	 88.25835367253707
sticking in an odd word.	 193.8815832086606
—Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others’ eyes but they	 36.43474494672569
can’t see the beam in their own.	 87.74187153227828
—_Raimeis_, says the citizen. There’s no-one as blind as the fellow	 33.215914332447326
that won’t see, if you know what that means. Where are our missing	 54.8197321027604
twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost	 124.30986609435361
tribes? And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world!	 25.064912826979256
And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax	 30.268165130343093
and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our	 25.20110271108012
tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our	 61.720480823447524
Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk	 105.91668867393936
and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite	 27.83546315270342
convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world. Where are	 98.7793372883439
the Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules, the	 31.37386717909078
Gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian	 26.673114784402696
purple to sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen? Read Tacitus and	 164.9142230744645
Ptolemy, even Giraldus Cambrensis. Wine, peltries, Connemara marble,	 25.358078335987376
silver from Tipperary, second to none, our farfamed horses even today,	 326.5473664099436
the Irish hobbies, with king Philip of Spain offering to pay customs	 91.61367910555539
duties for the right to fish in our waters. What do the yellowjohns of	 45.647438508076284
Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths? And the beds	 53.27236644551919
of the Barrow and Shannon they won’t deepen with millions of acres of	 42.83587480415091
marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption?	 24.792322770133808
—As treeless as Portugal we’ll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland	 66.61357716711827
with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land.	 96.53840894571564
Larches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast. I	 77.79100100925787
was reading a report of lord Castletown’s...	 100.84285865283042
—Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain	 55.543738933716256
elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage. Save the	 28.52076861780435
trees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of	 69.55001134377663
Eire, O.	 62.41067936669871
—Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.	 138.58214040366465
The fashionable international world attended _en masse_ this afternoon	 51.01432368548488
at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief	 76.59243014372986
ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine	 22.94792423505724
Valley. Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash,	 25.6283485886464
Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs	 32.31528930258777
Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss	 23.525176397002276
Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche	 17.70074830086592
Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower,	 17.183477051523244
Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel	 61.100301364988375
Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall,	 9.650395055296308
Mrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs	 104.28340989162982
Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of	 17.17828612695813
Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence. The bride who was	 30.544975400724287
given away by her father, the M’Conifer of the Glands, looked	 51.69905855588659
exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised	 71.79048485542131
silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of	 28.663307672259926
broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe,	 49.27524837199402
the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn	 25.36872790735588
bronze. The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce	 58.33980925875496
Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same	 68.1027171268567
tone, a dainty _motif_ of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a	 86.9522374408404
pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form	 18.007893542515628
of heron feathers of paletinted coral. Senhor Enrique Flor presided at	 8.365430529145232
the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed	 27.882346017416268
numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of	 132.43851680455813
_Woodman, spare that tree_ at the conclusion of the service. On leaving	 30.209753304113946
the church of Saint Fiacre _in Horto_ after the papal blessing the	 42.3707987543617
happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts,	 34.218782388588146
beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries,	 4.790717778615041
mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots. Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan	 33.531600227687704
will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.	 41.60631955398845
—And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. We had our trade with	 63.24825686952757
Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were	 63.64883702837967
pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.	 25.603130858569454
—And will again, says Joe.	 58.46239683135472
—And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the	 50.156659686379825
citizen, clapping his thigh. Our harbours that are empty will be full	 123.4581322667634
again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom	 80.70007921332527
of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a	 36.06551913464408
fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O’Reillys and the	 13.021136903204972
O’Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with	 33.87841417711425
the emperor Charles the Fifth himself. And will again, says he, when	 90.5754456727686
the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own	 66.78672230144605
flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor’s harps, no, the oldest flag	 75.3951822588263
afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns	 16.757611990352036
on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.	 67.48198742908924
And he took the last swig out of the pint. Moya. All wind and piss like	 41.96982462597677
a tanyard cat. Cows in Connacht have long horns. As much as his bloody	 72.85853811434554
life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled	 71.85084984915049
multitude in Shanagolden where he daren’t show his nose with the Molly	 70.00683862378546
Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the	 47.94995403047678
holding of an evicted tenant.	 53.42888155934585
—Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse. What will you have?	 49.6441684210886
—An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.	 36.67438613013818
—Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. Terry! Are you	 73.44522938001184
asleep?	 22450.278269757076
—Yes, sir, says Terry. Small whisky and bottle of Allsop. Right, sir.	 58.34457511615
Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead	 111.2489513460053
of attending to the general public. Picture of a butting match, trying	 32.925983994776146
to crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his	 84.7102387997
head down like a bull at a gate. And another one: _Black Beast Burned	 163.11421769763646
in Omaha, Ga_. A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing	 41.62365943012916
at a Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under	 40.92760443084088
him. Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and	 40.84174755865071
crucify him to make sure of their job.	 78.60151462508867
—But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at	 56.64373725564817
bay?	 13350.671348633037
—I’ll tell you what about it, says the citizen. Hell upon earth it is.	 34.1726406109638
Read the revelations that’s going on in the papers about flogging on	 74.4195400248424
the training ships at Portsmouth. A fellow writes that calls himself	 38.33728371391516
_Disgusted One_.	 46.47610260289422
So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of	 44.138102150880776
tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the	 27.740392320314477
parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad	 72.78144825647144
brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend	 49.65242604161393
of a gun.	 75.05458668175882
—A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John	 50.94221084618869
Beresford called it but the modern God’s Englishman calls it caning on	 73.5896743183807
the breech.	 7.77559996992721
And says John Wyse:	 26.88725818393974
—’Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.	 93.90347435951522
Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane	 58.87715953231785
and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad	 42.46966457479053
till he yells meila murder.	 138.9701686845304
—That’s your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the	 77.3108588218985
earth. The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary	 75.05717229665963
chamber on the face of God’s earth and their land in the hands of a	 87.49868318263171
dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons. That’s the great empire they	 73.42355977314938
boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.	 15.870619309371648
—On which the sun never rises, says Joe.	 67.05779429424898
—And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it. The	 49.25089352345337
unfortunate yahoos believe it.	 47.66739791283005
They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth,	 68.97324921603017
and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast,	 39.02238809381117
born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was	 107.77816915467766
scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day	 28.216878807551357
he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend	 20.00074721380868
till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be	 34.034390667228074
paid.	 20995.86342471813
—But, says Bloom, isn’t discipline the same everywhere. I mean wouldn’t	 78.66127310106836
it be the same here if you put force against force?	 79.98387531251821
Didn’t I tell you? As true as I’m drinking this porter if he was at his	 96.51700617050284
last gasp he’d try to downface you that dying was living.	 165.53694373835614
—We’ll put force against force, says the citizen. We have our greater	 28.57814357280012
Ireland beyond the sea. They were driven out of house and home in the	 44.56578794299328
black 47. Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid	 44.4702807029898
low by the batteringram and the _Times_ rubbed its hands and told the	 77.45726351383196
whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as	 72.85908337726147
redskins in America. Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres. But the	 74.37768547675851
Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of	 56.23352403604902
crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro. Ay,	 66.27626063197741
they drove out the peasants in hordes. Twenty thousand of them died in	 51.97736633683276
the coffinships. But those that came to the land of the free remember	 47.9887259807316
the land of bondage. And they will come again and with a vengeance, no	 40.822233331161385
cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.	 7.886788854590277
—Perfectly true, says Bloom. But my point was...	 281.3529650341171
—We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned. Since the	 31.149752776528693
poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at	 69.26131624062178
Killala.	 4.608171674364364
—Ay, says John Wyse. We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us	 51.242174822783625
against the Williamites and they betrayed us. Remember Limerick and the	 54.171574463733165
broken treatystone. We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the	 86.69464863760932
wild geese. Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield and O’Donnell, duke of Tetuan	 44.978281979826164
in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria	 27.19739558320639
Teresa. But what did we ever get for it?	 96.75384319126113
—The French! says the citizen. Set of dancing masters! Do you know what	 49.37205151897353
it is? They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland. Aren’t they	 30.766741929416494
trying to make an _Entente cordiale_ now at Tay Pay’s dinnerparty with	 29.524232845272195
perfidious Albion? Firebrands of Europe and they always were.	 29.324393666212412
—_Conspuez les Français_, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.	 74.8606127729112
—And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven’t we	 27.178914110647934
had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George	 79.3916838058642
the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that’s	 31.977839332288063
dead?	 2339.4292884751385
Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old	 35.64509362604273
one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every	 75.31015754437395
night of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman	 40.79641100186616
carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by	 87.6745300526336
the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about _Ehren on the	 66.0973258282716
Rhine_ and come where the boose is cheaper.	 65.65424442865522
—Well, says J. J. We have Edward the peacemaker now.	 37.38047559680571
—Tell that to a fool, says the citizen. There’s a bloody sight more pox	 46.29864973978098
than pax about that boyo. Edward Guelph-Wettin!	 95.7679750777388
—And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and	 40.308047749472784
bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic	 41.60919749453106
Majesty’s racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his	 72.21059490284875
jockeys rode. The earl of Dublin, no less.	 87.07709276812972
—They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little	 66.70384530495386
Alf.	 3963.332935535945
And says J. J.:	 18.279630943463943
—Considerations of space influenced their lordships’ decision.	 19.721243726592448
—Will you try another, citizen? says Joe.	 24.690358094087852
—Yes, sir, says he. I will.	 29.92937168969676
—You? says Joe.	 38.60290500956331
—Beholden to you, Joe, says I. May your shadow never grow less.	 70.2789449048549
—Repeat that dose, says Joe.	 21.112334317749962
Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with	 131.6091714931293
his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling	 41.93118069749499
about.	 703.7228526602032
—Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it.	 45.4148497502247
Perpetuating national hatred among nations.	 76.06383270869314
—But do you know what a nation means? says John Wyse.	 24.294195751477258
—Yes, says Bloom.	 41.760928040598216
—What is it? says John Wyse.	 15.264400524680637
—A nation? says Bloom. A nation is the same people living in the same	 32.806383725614715
place.	 2996.2721040408474
—By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that’s so I’m a nation for I’m	 154.16745516857722
living in the same place for the past five years.	 64.98646342997722
So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to	 48.58628565104211
muck out of it:	 19.345715888542948
—Or also living in different places.	 89.96663467971858
—That covers my case, says Joe.	 97.23990149299094
—What is your nation if I may ask? says the citizen.	 40.265290724150205
—Ireland, says Bloom. I was born here. Ireland.	 99.10594799120231
The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and,	 50.186571012770976
gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.	 51.13705630738966
—After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to	 39.2906322012368
swab himself dry.	 79.95262951980952
—Here you are, citizen, says Joe. Take that in your right hand and	 61.9692575421443
repeat after me the following words.	 154.17960391434224
The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth	 21.265514937068833
attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh,	 7.4440498933492165
authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and	 33.43897645520837
called forth prolonged admiration. No need to dwell on the legendary	 68.54435171375086
beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly	 31.089024970192735
discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the	 62.36025864831456
four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American	 148.97333944810146
puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said	 130.51998383152065
in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill. The	 74.62138447596179
scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and	 44.74050940630743
raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive	 10.735884572751521
stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as	 78.33641217787178
when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy	 42.79520648744672
long long ago in the time of the Barmecides. Glendalough, the lovely	 24.770465690329907
lakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh	 15.503963089068405
and the Twelve Pins, Ireland’s Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh	 79.95238864764471
Patrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company	 136.24619256033117
(Limited), Lough Neagh’s banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde’s tower, the	 23.5583930476584
Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun’s hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of	 42.086974381219676
Aherlow, Lynch’s castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at	 72.30608506974195
Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids,	 3.933542382544028
Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury’s Hotel, S.	 105.8026101135438
Patrick’s Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory,	 39.9548911290827
Curley’s hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington,	 28.191599160586406
the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse,	 44.22836993353822
Fingal’s Cave—all these moving scenes are still there for us today	 121.34435636162243
rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed	 205.8110377821488
over them and by the rich incrustations of time.	 79.9538893657632
—Show us over the drink, says I. Which is which?	 154.8649469500918
—That’s mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.	 37.81475085492819
—And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted.	 44.14474798195413
Also now. This very moment. This very instant.	 92.35242112596283
Gob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.	 64.68358523874443
—Robbed, says he. Plundered. Insulted. Persecuted. Taking what belongs	 33.681286592861596
to us by right. At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold	 77.08622256649039
by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.	 64.8361151454181
—Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? says the citizen.	 18.86513167366257
—I’m talking about injustice, says Bloom.	 33.46407344339596
—Right, says John Wyse. Stand up to it then with force like men.	 51.67643299338168
That’s an almanac picture for you. Mark for a softnosed bullet. Old	 68.75597510736281
lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun. Gob, he’d adorn a	 37.51661739145118
sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse’s apron on him. And	 46.3482171987103
then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as	 62.56451055928392
limp as a wet rag.	 366.24505138676494
—But it’s no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all that. That’s not	 135.7216115492001
life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that	 68.5500153103777
it’s the very opposite of that that is really life.	 74.34707600346213
—What? says Alf.	 39.987232684695634
—Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred. I must go now, says	 44.221048211051055
he to John Wyse. Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is	 91.76109729551108
there. If he comes just say I’ll be back in a second. Just a moment.	 104.22552136128206
Who’s hindering you? And off he pops like greased lightning.	 185.59795265671045
—A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. Universal love.	 24.17955270313193
—Well, says John Wyse. Isn’t that what we’re told. Love your neighbour.	 95.46196087421481
—That chap? says the citizen. Beggar my neighbour is his motto. Love,	 45.70018667164374
moya! He’s a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.	 20.801419656439023
Love loves to love love. Nurse loves the new chemist. Constable 14A	 142.2648667670541
loves Mary Kelly. Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle.	 104.85246763985326
M. B. loves a fair gentleman. Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow.	 28.31369906265532
Jumbo, the elephant, loves Alice, the elephant. Old Mr Verschoyle with	 42.37292807661205
the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye. The man	 78.16129524718176
in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead. His Majesty the King	 52.310960544646214
loves Her Majesty the Queen. Mrs Norman W. Tupper loves officer Taylor.	 59.31386653506326
You love a certain person. And this person loves that other person	 79.15722146822198
because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.	 126.18437752851207
—Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song. More power,	 87.32605240312026
citizen.	 5254.670455482157
—Hurrah, there, says Joe.	 53.48475547944934
—The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.	 48.37633008190358
And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.	 72.423704936012
—We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket.	 95.11131622463691
What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women	 47.132585583584145
and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text _God is love_	 58.4870220153756
pasted round the mouth of his cannon? The bible! Did you read that skit	 41.96659759647144
in the _United Irishman_ today about that Zulu chief that’s visiting	 127.43845555266364
England?	 11239.530202378506
—What’s that? says Joe.	 35.695106467987806
So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts	 48.69663726161504
reading out:	 519.338169698789
—A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented	 29.81906383502186
yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in	 29.506707371396303
Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the	 69.7821326480136
heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in	 44.40043036602448
his dominions. The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of	 21.660260148982353
which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely	 24.50569408416406
translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod	 27.758492563448165
Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the	 22.03425804905951
cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire,	 63.40822082211997
stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an	 43.06404455142797
illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of	 27.656937733472308
England’s greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief	 25.114230858665884
woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the	 84.04094040416064
august hand of the Royal Donor. The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of	 33.141332788812605
firstshot usquebaugh to the toast _Black and White_ from the skull of	 28.754759903989978
his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty	 23.776133481699084
Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and	 34.63743126543186
signed his mark in the visitors’ book, subsequently executing a	 57.22210319597477
charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed	 44.42229809123631
several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.	 97.74550253979324
—Widow woman, says Ned. I wouldn’t doubt her. Wonder did he put that	 98.31683917671607
bible to the same use as I would.	 102.837060481787
—Same only more so, says Lenehan. And thereafter in that fruitful land	 114.71078764234797
the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.	 5.74716311795317
—Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse.	 36.03741376203734
—No, says the citizen. It’s not signed Shanganagh. It’s only	 62.082746708889836
initialled: P.	 142.4851970108439
—And a very good initial too, says Joe.	 44.22511469000433
—That’s how it’s worked, says the citizen. Trade follows the flag.	 93.81137812564009
—Well, says J. J., if they’re any worse than those Belgians in the	 35.52902073343848
Congo Free State they must be bad. Did you read that report by a man	 88.12849175002573
what’s this his name is?	 68.84621967952187
—Casement, says the citizen. He’s an Irishman.	 27.8523004448363
—Yes, that’s the man, says J. J. Raping the women and girls and	 40.966388919347935
flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they	 28.272001574411085
can out of them.	 214.2185040351767
—I know where he’s gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.	 21.63569827433308
—Who? says I.	 54.55936263869861
—Bloom, says he. The courthouse is a blind. He had a few bob on	 51.47485905216682
_Throwaway_ and he’s gone to gather in the shekels.	 27.191093180532036
—Is it that whiteeyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a	 26.801382546186105
horse in anger in his life?	 81.0133439763434
—That’s where he’s gone, says Lenehan. I met Bantam Lyons going to back	 40.55885662282418
that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip.	 84.21979211593273
Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on. He’s the	 74.80787416175484
only man in Dublin has it. A dark horse.	 99.34282051119544
—He’s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.	 92.91507386366776
—Mind, Joe, says I. Show us the entrance out.	 72.87678124423307
—There you are, says Terry.	 73.7039077009881
Goodbye Ireland I’m going to Gort. So I just went round the back of the	 71.79421908700094
yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was	 51.41232254499848
letting off my _(Throwaway_ twenty to) letting off my load gob says I	 135.19766204749124
to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in	 68.37339966567588
Slattery’s off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings	 62.62353056213471
is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was	 19.079533977946063
telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have	 86.62577328962455
done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube _she’s	 37.29326215089727
better_ or _she’s_ (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool	 44.76459500673961
if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!)	 78.8292871972053
Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody	 92.92470682953326
(there’s the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.	 64.94771493944558
So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it	 79.63588660176201
was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper	 80.81225444504281
all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off	 11.721060442356714
of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk	 40.4511995465968
about selling Irish industries. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Gob, that	 75.20853756230574
puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show.	 90.13219772280615
Give us a bloody chance. God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody	 52.30093091442616
mouseabout. Mr Bloom with his argol bargol. And his old fellow before	 33.90742646478216
him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that	 36.44314297879844
poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country	 71.53923336290416
with his baubles and his penny diamonds. Loans by post on easy terms.	 40.59513597704071
Any amount of money advanced on note of hand. Distance no object. No	 88.0602800594413
security. Gob, he’s like Lanty MacHale’s goat that’d go a piece of the	 37.88235550531764
road with every one.	 474.5020870447637
—Well, it’s a fact, says John Wyse. And there’s the man now that’ll	 40.83241337706446
tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.	 67.14009426497913
Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power	 99.34012301267543
with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the	 38.07049588878256
collector general’s, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the	 32.696881952015616
registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the	 66.31170212974685
country at the king’s expense.	 121.4405061386857
Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their	 30.11505569557663
palfreys.	 4.608171674364364
—Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party.	 109.83288024511471
Saucy knave! To us!	 19.3661184558211
So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.	 108.0916063989091
Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.	 23.698254085999793
—Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.	 92.8937554903449
—Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. Look to our steeds.	 46.96996148305658
And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.	 112.89210137070873
—Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare	 163.47106740960584
larder. I know not what to offer your lordships.	 43.933229951758186
—How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant	 124.34653602874286
countenance, So servest thou the king’s messengers, master Taptun?	 142.66313316611505
An instantaneous change overspread the landlord’s visage.	 82.50797878673136
—Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. An you be the king’s	 229.81045140784113
messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught. The	 79.80425372870805
king’s friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my	 87.41199678234224
house I warrant me.	 88.06199435598954
—Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty	 135.95553235577327
trencherman by his aspect. Hast aught to give us?	 50.55297092769718
Mine host bowed again as he made answer:	 59.65037880120593
—What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of	 57.016500431192924
venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog’s bacon, a boar’s	 21.13841550186429
head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a	 24.64992260536048
flagon of old Rhenish?	 18.55377849962155
—Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios!	 98.3607270013485
—Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A poor house and a bare	 173.21215964011375
larder, quotha! ’Tis a merry rogue.	 66.47102750337176
So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.	 216.1455144996253
—Where is he? says Lenehan. Defrauding widows and orphans.	 26.30043225935542
—Isn’t that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen	 29.78522423367506
about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?	 105.42467828655194
—That’s so, says Martin. Or so they allege.	 54.64101461857034
—Who made those allegations? says Alf.	 96.49179583068987
—I, says Joe. I’m the alligator.	 32.19017131447362
—And after all, says John Wyse, why can’t a jew love his country like	 112.46042480075319
the next fellow?	 58.641538328386325
—Why not? says J. J., when he’s quite sure which country it is.	 79.31092230298144
—Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the	 34.534633652773394
hell is he? says Ned. Or who is he? No offence, Crofton.	 72.10981053999143
—Who is Junius? says J. J.	 25.880566298584274
—We don’t want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.	 37.37209637051181
—He’s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was	 45.487618485377
he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. We know	 49.51758278685681
that in the castle.	 83.25789998340466
—Isn’t he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power.	 80.40072425176983
—Not at all, says Martin. Only namesakes. His name was Virag, the	 79.82400612069954
father’s name that poisoned himself. He changed it by deedpoll, the	 104.69417906143953
father did.	 1899.8511077611859
—That’s the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. Island of saints	 84.58509794370059
and sages!	 15.372472535691111
—Well, they’re still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. For that	 33.2014281436145
matter so are we.	 498.31156183271025
—Yes, says J. J., and every male that’s born they think it may be their	 77.61295247242164
Messiah. And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe,	 92.10678416054876
till he knows if he’s a father or a mother.	 140.99837457536506
—Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.	 83.54282660210909
—O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his	 98.61553643217111
that died was born. I met him one day in the south city markets buying	 32.06535586385443
a tin of Neave’s food six weeks before the wife was delivered.	 72.53488074201702
—_En ventre sa mère_, says J. J.	 19.69209286553144
—Do you call that a man? says the citizen.	 31.392193452413675
—I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.	 26.676609020421555
—Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.	 67.21268536150104
—And who does he suspect? says the citizen.	 43.89704898579907
Gob, there’s many a true word spoken in jest. One of those mixed	 88.12241582811231
middlings he is. Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a	 35.73241494026709
month with headache like a totty with her courses. Do you know what I’m	 33.10988840078298
telling you? It’d be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like	 92.32636990612176
of that and throw him in the bloody sea. Justifiable homicide, so it	 56.374958115020334
would. Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of	 53.52149772708158
stuff like a man. Give us your blessing. Not as much as would blind	 106.43348226334511
your eye.	 222.92599128043514
—Charity to the neighbour, says Martin. But where is he? We can’t wait.	 92.99554056238402
—A wolf in sheep’s clothing, says the citizen. That’s what he is. Virag	 19.80342929027464
from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him. Cursed by God.	 48.4893663200402
—Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? says Ned.	 149.30558812378794
—Only one, says Martin. We must be quick. J. J. and S.	 89.53760660446808
—You, Jack? Crofton? Three half ones, Terry.	 183.21879155204186
—Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us,	 104.93438112315242
says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our	 63.86701856420879
shores.	 4.608171674364364
—Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass. God bless all here is my	 62.57410728849109
prayer.	 19177.630523474185
—Amen, says the citizen.	 49.34824119901355
—And I’m sure He will, says Joe.	 55.12931389094935
And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with	 25.329166488356414
acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and	 4.7090571665870256
subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors	 22.413985108117366

Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter	 24.04692696826662

with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords	 16.311436296119016
and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of	 43.842338545982734

forceps, stags’ horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a	 34.98051622737075
dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns. And as they wended their way	 68.25652371843667
by Nelson’s Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little	 105.79400359948504
Britain street chanting the introit in _Epiphania Domini_ which	 28.015852841543037
beginneth _Surge, illuminare_ and thereafter most sweetly the gradual	 8.94893255797917
_Omnes_ which saith _de Saba venient_ they did divers wonders such as	 29.986835709641202
casting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes,	 126.92460419649616
healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had	 60.3088269815108
been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and	 23.10948643801549
prophesying. And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the	 36.34214961067334
reverend Father O’Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick. And when the	 178.18182752829344
good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard	 69.12945617065029
Kiernan and Co, limited, 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street, wholesale	 26.132732653713816
grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed for the sale of beer, wine	 48.43613644880975
and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the	 54.12111179835562
house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults	 18.532515294422584
and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and	 9.2845097209012
the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the	 14.82464129949656
lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that	 68.69771397973268
house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and	 39.263583241531215
make the angels of His light to inhabit therein. And entering he	 119.76852877048964
blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed	 34.26994107565095
answered his prayers.	 886.119961772545
—_Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini._	 17.306239851692055
—_Qui fecit cœlum et terram._	 34.965570707297225
—_Dominus vobiscum._	 4.411654744205047
—_Et cum spiritu tuo._	 20.54389886241377
And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he	 77.99182328934289
prayed and they all with him prayed:	 99.15458513711901
—_Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde	 8.615656304596937
super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et	 13.8453615565996
voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem	 6.61341420039719
sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animæ tutelam Te auctore	 8.951791971243138
percipiat per Christum Dominum nostrum._	 11.544897906197257
—And so say all of us, says Jack.	 174.05027367119786
—Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.	 402.6146811609543
—Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson. And butter for fish.	 84.44091958319538
I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike	 79.03612528018363
when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a	 46.377176262238144
hurry.	 3129.8651959710423
—I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you. I hope	 32.98940214159068
I’m not...	 104.66724225115479
—No, says Martin, we’re ready.	 40.0008438191861
Courthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver.	 86.05217715867416
Mean bloody scut. Stand us a drink itself. Devil a sweet fear! There’s	 235.3147856609543
a jew for you! All for number one. Cute as a shithouse rat. Hundred to	 72.75890540667434
five.	 1470.1643938704804
—Don’t tell anyone, says the citizen.	 16.88598103432802
—Beg your pardon, says he.	 93.1214793746464
—Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue. Come along now.	 101.96169503981483
—Don’t tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him. It’s a	 15.59537481307775
secret.	 5700.165742041647
And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.	 47.92306829702537
—Bye bye all, says Martin.	 88.60825906617248
And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or	 43.38393315213433
whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be	 43.49251944624646
all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.	 98.58739079452266
—Off with you, says Martin to the jarvey.	 66.2509495127869
The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop	 33.220011567548354
the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off	 48.214182010568855
forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard. A many comely	 63.13456735708193
nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the	 32.46926442474944
sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the	 90.44588791417321
cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the	 51.352199708334986
equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds	 90.4642477920031
them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas	 28.669132079499313
they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair. Even so	 85.74382281646278
did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters.	 96.76763746547337
And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark	 42.824184753520285
clave the waves.	 49.879170764713706
But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the	 30.17046319956811
citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the	 44.568823551887164
dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and	 30.381510724466036
candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little	 79.59401421899173
Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.	 69.44306579820048
—Let me alone, says he.	 37.40978828169683
And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls	 30.350500868480918
out of him:	 36.085377130386824
—Three cheers for Israel!	 32.43952724343235
Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ’ sake	 26.09998807572879
and don’t be making a public exhibition of yourself. Jesus, there’s	 75.65652096606854
always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about	 72.44711782710334
bloody nothing. Gob, it’d turn the porter sour in your guts, so it	 191.82689705408674
would.	 807.7907537064854
And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and	 44.81047307627054
Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and	 66.24027580587486
Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews	 102.06941577401194
and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him	 48.24740307356117
to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a	 31.844216886412294
patch over his eye starts singing _If the man in the moon was a jew,	 53.22248711575359
jew, jew_ and a slut shouts out of her:	 92.53831857627564
—Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister!	 248.37358079549034
And says he:	 42.91269478285161
—Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza. And	 12.993258646731388
the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew. Your God.	 79.31441706009565
—He had no father, says Martin. That’ll do now. Drive ahead.	 60.401666060626454
—Whose God? says the citizen.	 116.2742793193944
—Well, his uncle was a jew, says he. Your God was a jew. Christ was a	 88.83433565970262
jew like me.	 578.5325372004315
Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.	 58.29608192604354
—By Jesus, says he, I’ll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy	 40.58053194948788
name. By Jesus, I’ll crucify him so I will. Give us that biscuitbox here.	 53.79157065553765
—Stop! Stop! says Joe.	 55.50546459103498
A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from	 69.14145222604162
the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid	 24.346183445517187
farewell to Nagyaságos uram Lipóti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander	 99.21417882806033
Thom’s, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for	 20.26160867517144
the distant clime of Százharminczbrojúgulyás-Dugulás (Meadow of	 15.326754864776857
Murmuring Waters). The ceremony which went off with great _éclat_ was	 98.4801235415619
characterised by the most affecting cordiality. An illuminated scroll	 15.096257268066342
of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to	 32.09325326875711
the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the	 14.445605273365771
community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket,	 28.70139168366892
tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work	 34.74130074403459
which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob _agus_ Jacob.	 37.42984210948863
The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of	 25.10881327427133
those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of	 53.65885515428178
Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of _Come Back to Erin_,	 120.19089636638569
followed immediately by _Rakóczsy’s March_. Tarbarrels and bonfires	 47.78438396391497
were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the	 20.901274251644217
Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains	 179.94044129931893
of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the	 18.289221233884362
Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of	 13.547617091248318
M’Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom. Amid	 11.78296189574698
cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a	 100.68345172363226
big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills,	 43.21622528569096
the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final	 51.97962719613608
floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were	 35.89629714585984
present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river,	 110.74292530014824
escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and	 9.608137483272232
Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical	 144.01158280145285
power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light.	 39.18187062138567
_Visszontlátásra, kedvés barátom! Visszontlátásra!_ Gone but not	 26.64198705531742
forgotten.	 3024.5303397649104
Gob, the devil wouldn’t stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin	 59.46725948723375
anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he	 55.04793957801761
shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen’s	 119.67008412757993
royal theatre:	 330.1750182728416
—Where is he till I murder him?	 78.58596128913861
And Ned and J. J. paralysed with the laughing.	 120.30603329667225
—Bloody wars, says I, I’ll be in for the last gospel.	 79.81119459690619
But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag’s head round the other	 75.46468802550645
way and off with him.	 107.67713103488768
—Hold on, citizen, says Joe. Stop!	 131.03823264595002
Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly. Mercy of God the	 46.5681251264731
sun was in his eyes or he’d have left him for dead. Gob, he near sent	 86.1088332723371
it into the county Longford. The bloody nag took fright and the old	 58.20226584419609
mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting	 115.17558354102616
and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.	 49.01405999253692
The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The	 83.76773675000676
observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the	 22.529541361452292
fifth grade of Mercalli’s scale, and there is no record extant of a	 25.008337232285424
similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534,	 27.11648965628923
the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas. The epicentre appears to	 29.70049071000078
have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn’s Quay	 32.049214576988206
ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres,	 30.436060543723624
two roods and one square pole or perch. All the lordly residences in	 32.47973868133082
the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble	 37.47114115517867
edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal	 48.97485637403066
debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it	 40.222093532830556
is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive. From the	 35.28618295668957
reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were	 33.33923553934609
accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic	 34.66209557399365
character. An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the	 36.87425113373274
much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a	 84.94554223891895
silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat	 43.75597785947845
of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of	 36.008288070032414
quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been	 99.41370626467967
discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island	 60.94146013038185
respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant’s	 14.6172956709152
causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in	 19.28921913811396
the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale. Other	 52.55267179900992
eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of	 35.43330446971037
enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying	 11.8853573880621
velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west. Messages of	 14.569842084985673
condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the	 29.395462046281068
different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously	 47.17567194649034
pleased to decree that a special _missa pro defunctis_ shall be	 85.51586923466454
celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral	 25.721521432352205
church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority	 42.24209368414454
of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who	 60.037237587556454
have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst. The work of	 95.90262344986084
salvage, removal of _débris,_ human remains etc has been entrusted to	 32.72589559958521
Messrs Michael Meade and Son, 159 Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T.	 85.06211168262428
and C. Martin, 77, 78, 79 and 80 North Wall, assisted by the men and	 46.97017035807631
officers of the Duke of Cornwall’s light infantry under the general	 49.615456934323554
supervision of H. R. H., rear admiral, the right honourable sir	 25.598100556366553

You never saw the like of it in all your born puff. Gob, if he got that	 65.27190869488689
lottery ticket on the side of his poll he’d remember the gold cup, he	 47.48285255286152
would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and	 37.5695159039296
battery and Joe for aiding and abetting. The jarvey saved his life by	 49.09519326044823
furious driving as sure as God made Moses. What? O, Jesus, he did. And	 160.635124142898
he let a volley of oaths after him.	 58.26656495736576
—Did I kill him, says he, or what?	 59.95071800195705
And he shouting to the bloody dog:	 36.32391200967331
—After him, Garry! After him, boy!	 83.65859119457495
And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old	 108.53204323138625
sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his	 35.29357503559165
lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb.	 52.73611726280199
Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise	 94.08488960023325
you.	 149.54238275787918
When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld	 135.46896076405832
the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven. And they beheld Him in	 42.32097961117738
the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having	 40.93741646900873
raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they	 115.11191968941151
durst not look upon Him. And there came a voice out of heaven, calling:	 106.93375031041656
_Elijah! Elijah!_ And He answered with a main cry: _Abba! Adonai!_ And	 38.18365265664082
they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels	 115.69396373863043
ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees	 22.768159595231648
over Donohoe’s in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.	 61.84483584704011
[ 13 ]	 463.94842625767166
The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious	 58.4218796982782
embrace. Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of	 43.46768094921722
all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud	 100.53653484097534
promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on	 78.39185685709924
the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on	 99.11350912299456
the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the	 101.91824542248433
stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a	 56.957468608516294
beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.	 66.790176545941
The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening	 62.430785804038685
scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly. Many a time and	 151.09340496702737
oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy	 34.989373816931334
chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy	 68.9229125257619
Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and	 66.58441914623108
Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits	 169.90641147337826
with caps to match and the name _H. M. S. Belleisle_ printed on both.	 72.29487913413088
For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very	 61.390841749413255
noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little	 68.55682446219333
fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them. They	 157.23832597874159
were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building	 61.37964670147522
castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy	 188.8193224387529
as the day was long. And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to	 67.62844966735709
and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with	 45.11839258591077
delight. He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a	 108.13430013688534
tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words. Cissy	 64.6946427462565
Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty	 67.23244955473972
dimple in his chin.	 26.722218824618345
—Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said. Say out big, big. I want a drink of	 107.37741787607433
water.	 1912.4591522108665
And baby prattled after her:	 103.57553308187735
—A jink a jink a jawbo.	 13.627550819405567
Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of	 47.60760826564222
children, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could	 61.002252639148466
never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that	 72.93667107105088
held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown	 85.50322546656312
bread with golden syrup on. What a persuasive power that girl had! But	 112.81605558046225
to be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in	 30.692408242335823
his new fancy bib. None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort,	 47.83704449706
was Cissy Caffrey. A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life,	 55.439647029198575
always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her	 55.11033168034023
cherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme. And Edy Boardman	 29.34248030167281
laughed too at the quaint language of little brother.	 116.38596996653048
But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and	 76.90368297524967
Master Jacky. Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to	 69.1642944108584
this golden rule. The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand	 93.17223892846145
which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go	 82.3676177958476
wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like	 39.49145446525187
the Martello tower had. But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky	 85.11237054634046
was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman’s	 46.214410380360384
house is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose	 67.83656938696939
that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the	 31.521476624852003
coveted castle too. Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master	 58.40359970773252
Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends.	 99.50487195641044
—Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively. At once! And you,	 135.32882899525276
Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand. Wait till I	 88.55947221023638
catch you for that.	 157.63646898771444
His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for	 86.19185025996228
their big sister’s word was law with the twins. And in a sad plight he	 84.23679237025434
was too after his misadventure. His little man-o’-war top and	 90.7649438208325
unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the	 59.67291835373346
art of smoothing over life’s tiny troubles and very quickly not one	 118.86452254133755
speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit. Still the blue	 121.86999338936491
eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed	 117.6178049740506
away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and	 55.074713413421904
said if she was near him she wouldn’t be far from him, her eyes dancing	 99.99617920236108
in admonition.	 25.877283914292452
—Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.	 320.3270594168735
She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:	 31.92428100868229
—What’s your name? Butter and cream?	 110.39365762096621
—Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman. Is Cissy your	 138.3101843782778
sweetheart?	 9224.21279475977
—Nao, tearful Tommy said.	 25.780378271260012
—Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy queried.	 183.0986282770941
—Nao, Tommy said.	 43.81966846429954
—I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from	 50.133633026823475
her shortsighted eyes. I know who is Tommy’s sweetheart. Gerty is	 68.26261154285837
Tommy’s sweetheart.	 192.2574474684794
—Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.	 30.325651341749914
Cissy’s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy	 56.57754535764438
Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman	 142.04421547871945
couldn’t see and to mind he didn’t wet his new tan shoes.	 71.86119372386942
But who was Gerty?	 127.11141253037145
Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought,	 120.52036441077216
gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a	 55.06975843753613
specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see. She was	 56.26088514643952
pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said,	 197.3468658812687
she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell. Her figure was slight and	 143.15425508230746
graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had	 96.98654250259385
been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the	 272.41140694584726
Widow Welch’s female pills and she was much better of those discharges	 128.1085284733263
she used to get and that tired feeling. The waxen pallor of her face	 26.231107435712683
was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth	 72.0999730302703
was a genuine Cupid’s bow, Greekly perfect. Her hands were of finely	 73.24070182680082
veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and	 28.25532249723509
queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used	 63.512677098057615
to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either. Bertha Supple	 87.35069013394663
told that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black	 97.95268372523033
out at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their	 204.08082374056164
little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told	 56.586336870861324
her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or	 111.62565251226803
she’d never speak to her again. No. Honour where honour is due. There	 128.67935833277872
was an innate refinement, a languid queenly _hauteur_ about Gerty which	 40.70212589181949
was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep.	 23.883462316341035
Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in	 62.1140540901666
her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education	 65.92591794646692
Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the	 44.762248025250884
land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow	 51.417543901444354
and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their	 47.58457536814535
devoirs to her. Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that	 44.96085479345656
lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed	 98.1870926100372
meaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful	 67.45214430342781
eyes, a charm few could resist. Why have women such eyes of witchery?	 195.5535749609566
Gerty’s were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and	 68.81127146008099
dark expressive brows. Time was when those brows were not so silkily	 138.11673235641916
seductive. It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful	 28.717642917154752
page of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try	 54.04326191031339
eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so	 52.026573510130376
becoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it. Then	 34.304245294128776
there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase	 81.70359721603558
your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose? That would	 103.24175614817389
suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one. But Gerty’s crowning	 89.71907583920567
glory was her wealth of wonderful hair. It was dark brown with a	 91.9458070248137
natural wave in it. She had cut it that very morning on account of the	 83.53792756188602
new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of	 36.33861807430417
luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth. And	 32.701645739284714
just now at Edy’s words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest	 54.15162643054047
rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet	 62.64601881501355
girlish shyness that of a surety God’s fair land of Ireland did not	 51.07782936003448
hold her equal.	 307.8931643399133
For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. She was	 50.370195678982945
about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue.	 74.53774198131285
Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent.	 61.02200336522857
The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out	 103.55225751226935
into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young	 53.88546376114465
May morning. She knew right well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy	 227.2908696697674
say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a	 51.98381292362663
lovers’ quarrel. As per usual somebody’s nose was out of joint about	 36.50186180110266
the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding	 112.07455805976386
up and down in front of her window. Only now his father kept him in in	 117.9171762038988
the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate	 44.65999501086136
that was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a	 41.17741190451099
doctor when he left the high school like his brother W. E. Wylie who	 79.08487493804887
was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university. Little	 67.09896737818825
recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart	 70.75990651565942
sometimes, piercing to the core. Yet he was young and perchance he	 51.99578311690107
might learn to love her in time. They were protestants in his family	 68.65869129437611
and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed	 97.17059424669469
Virgin and then Saint Joseph. But he was undeniably handsome with an	 128.09997051187042
exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the	 135.65382725084427
shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would	 95.13664089682848
know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the	 116.92499514735778
bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice	 79.33597721104461
perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size	 85.39113190755862
too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so	 63.44436941892979
frightfully clever because he didn’t go and ride up and down in front	 71.14136839360533
of her bit of a garden.	 84.07522038789304
Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of	 74.45423114639637
Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be	 71.29834356518323
out. A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because	 69.74694336079094
it was expected in the _Lady’s Pictorial_ that electric blue would be	 35.42268970426944
worn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket	 41.030711002005205
(in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her	 73.37013420253238
favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy	 252.07784157965781
threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful	 92.34055649076731
figure to perfection. She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of	 74.83021818990063
wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue	 12.128637768656544
chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone. All Tuesday	 77.26996953631541
week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she	 85.5450310292514
found what she wanted at Clery’s summer sales, the very it, slightly	 449.04197871313465
shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny.	 84.32001186272836
She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on	 62.701846561233246
then, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to	 114.27220135183346
her! And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew	 49.36921134601298
that that would take the shine out of some people she knew. Her shoes	 40.38927386190782
were the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she	 68.68123525564779
was very _petite_ but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a	 65.4398060456155
five, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one	 103.97392024368672
smart buckle over her higharched instep. Her wellturned ankle displayed	 24.914340848619275
its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount	 88.34823630662771
and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with	 34.48112359195211
highspliced heels and wide garter tops. As for undies they were Gerty’s	 74.76689133503803
chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet	 107.56822745669574
seventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in	 113.5652055434299
his heart to blame her? She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty	 70.78912400849742
stitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with	 47.752613139307094
different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen,	 59.41136224903698
and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the	 43.86968792699983
wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because	 70.83069559659171
she wouldn’t trust those washerwomen as far as she’d see them scorching	 43.34944021901931
the things. She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her	 148.08593702322943
own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on	 126.42841780460583
her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his	 151.81130480483074
father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and	 56.00607320991222
because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was	 44.130315620227016
dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside	 115.90102948575557
out and that was for luck and lovers’ meeting if you put those things	 73.62886495469007
on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so	 113.06691318391249
long as it wasn’t of a Friday.	 103.77982854214362
And yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is	 57.635934817496235
there all the time. Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give	 51.736315274750844
worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving	 43.376555148847
way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings	 67.57182945846645
though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the	 50.25487454855535
mirror. You are lovely, Gerty, it said. The paly light of evening falls	 219.81718484588026
upon a face infinitely sad and wistful. Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain.	 79.1742449568721
Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage	 112.42018833432653
has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T.	 49.30270685960327
C. D. (because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs	 213.50176724369297
Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was	 61.93990984595128
wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox	 43.872742191695025
was not to be. He was too young to understand. He would not believe in	 72.98227262098384
love, a woman’s birthright. The night of the party long ago in Stoer’s	 50.97985675299845
(he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an	 57.29464612751673
arm round her waist she went white to the very lips. He called her	 121.91011268959755
little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the	 59.343681970534185
first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from	 43.732566452291195
the room with a remark about refreshments. Impetuous fellow! Strength	 93.7743978203328
of character had never been Reggy Wylie’s strong point and he who would	 125.19843151229568
woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men. But waiting,	 94.62658116730742
always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be	 81.74987161739058
over. No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous	 194.19537143481364
love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who	 91.37087410185926
had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey,	 150.35395878294403
and who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her	 54.618216018987575
to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort	 94.88196199880531
her with a long long kiss. It would be like heaven. For such a one she	 78.20976436588641
yearns this balmy summer eve. With all the heart of her she longs to be	 36.90560693043616
his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in	 129.61890378572866
health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward.	 425.3957811208013
And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was	 54.87360168386564
just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his	 152.1387980575085
little wife to be. Then they could talk about her till they went blue	 98.83537498323494
in the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she	 52.212397294152915
would be twentytwo in November. She would care for him with creature	 43.90347413002874
comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked	 95.45620728678615
that feeling of hominess. Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue	 75.77200079421137
and queen Ann’s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden	 48.04892819817071
opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a	 45.64750353975724
fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same	 42.768314040607166
direction, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of	 98.04856092309207
eggs though she didn’t like the eating part when there were any people	 124.31620775770486
that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn’t eat something	 103.23791495820055
poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully	 65.97511578714669
appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph	 13.659853979076095
of grandpapa Giltrap’s lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was	 43.98962454925037
so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in	 85.20959334314489
Clery’s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses. He would be	 77.02743386005768
tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a	 188.04788492701172
husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed	 90.73070730798139
sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their	 37.304682678378796
honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in	 58.2187074847252
a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both	 94.2902944159998
have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and	 135.91406967117783
before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a	 84.02521419667738
good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.	 62.16934517775575
Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then	 59.89838403252253
she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run	 51.09136250084725
off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight. But Tommy	 122.71411652824132
said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with	 60.63107127583223
the ball and if he took it there’d be wigs on the green but Tommy said	 50.88499099133576
it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if	 40.0647939274517
you please. The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy	 66.99630001678611
Caffrey since he was out of pinnies. Edy told him no, no and to be off	 78.82275784011235
now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.	 77.21982209475071
—You’re not my sister, naughty Tommy said. It’s my ball.	 100.86702570939275
But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her	 75.40958683919767
finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand	 65.37708800179686
and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.	 114.8145384367528
—Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.	 238.93195721917706
And she tickled tiny tot’s two cheeks to make him forget and played	 108.36438063983789
here’s the lord mayor, here’s his two horses, here’s his gingerbread	 54.53509278429355
carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper	 49.20634457418545
chin. But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way	 117.77683642027642
like that from everyone always petting him.	 86.63452608210694
—I’d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won’t	 104.56664886577535
say.	 957.1327818468302
—On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.	 80.85560382790045
Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy	 59.03235537224311
saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she’d be ashamed of her	 90.76983798411891
life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was	 55.365056778803165
sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said. But not a pin cared	 104.16271119199224
Ciss.	 16894.802131706583
—Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of	 23.159392809696723
her nose. Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I’d look at	 39.91127936079007
him.	 330.5397417229756
Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls. You had to laugh at her sometimes.	 77.22155020656375
For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea	 47.10271825358244
and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men’s faces on	 34.68209074711896
her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to	 89.38233217936299
go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the	 65.1444022940276
Miss White. That was just like Cissycums. O, and will you ever forget	 93.29156928222642
her the evening she dressed up in her father’s suit and hat and the	 96.66676832721996
burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a	 89.04861341321354
cigarette. There was none to come up to her for fun. But she was	 62.04985691947795
sincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever	 38.2305651495593
made, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.	 99.999015454465
And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the	 50.52337095528036
pealing anthem of the organ. It was the men’s temperance retreat	 22.051836888370246
conducted by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S. J., rosary,	 10.067572223955196
sermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament. They were there	 21.32999447069697
gathered together without distinction of social class (and a most	 67.81361739927912
edifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves,	 50.730848447583995
after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the	 35.458050460041626
immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her	 12.990656187801553
to intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin	 112.48654279221728
of virgins. How sad to poor Gerty’s ears! Had her father only avoided	 130.27746621344113
the clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders	 28.473802692003456
the drink habit cured in Pearson’s Weekly, she might now be rolling in	 102.46975968269116
her carriage, second to none. Over and over had she told herself that	 151.08562239380157
as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp	 96.41113241798254
because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window	 55.76020372889593
dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking.	 57.95499624349803
But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had	 42.64363185753994
cast its shadow over her childhood days. Nay, she had even witnessed in	 82.43703218153671
the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen	 42.507279927602205
her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself	 83.34113294333054
completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it	 43.1874616260629
was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of	 44.574235629579675
kindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.	 50.26999860124947
And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful,	 103.05239702626446
Virgin most merciful. And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard	 263.2202756169525
her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman	 46.531040645971494
off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like	 42.40440545150675
himself passing along the strand taking a short walk. You never saw him	 71.24959282898074
any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a	 72.90427722242947
father because he was too old or something or on account of his face	 69.55930530291106
(it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the	 48.976204800800986
pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose. Poor	 98.31383240919702
father! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang _Tell me,	 120.60376963327604
Mary, how to woo thee_ or _My love and cottage near Rochelle_ and they	 124.5801121396547
had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby’s salad dressing for supper	 75.78548998852435
and when he sang _The moon hath raised_ with Mr Dignam that died	 93.8220812415798
suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke. Her	 121.73366482429847
mother’s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom	 106.93795964866267
and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have	 63.84925893482599
had a group taken. No-one would have thought the end was so near. Now	 113.23354564209014
he was laid to rest. And her mother said to him to let that be a	 78.33679416891044
warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn’t even go to the	 41.387257613308755
funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him	 42.71966500041742
the letters and samples from his office about Catesby’s cork lino,	 63.88486422959986
artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and	 76.69355023612778
always bright and cheery in the home.	 76.45040396975737
A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the	 82.12455981382016
house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in	 91.69110037419244
gold. And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was	 100.57425070272211
it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn’t	 37.497074739479686
like her mother’s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single	 64.39542647434665
thing they ever had words about, taking snuff. Everyone thought the	 358.12983344555414
world of her for her gentle ways. It was Gerty who turned off the gas	 147.24936636551885
at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of	 40.59748081497826
that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime	 58.0184683744417
Mr Tunney the grocer’s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days	 21.673895736326926
where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a	 70.33594612395817
threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with	 41.929737744621534
oldtime chivalry through her lattice window. You could see there was a	 39.81102551386232
story behind it. The colours were done something lovely. She was in a	 152.00686833622072
soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in	 117.67627502589733
chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat. She often looked at them	 51.46351365751933
dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own	 50.7218225013001
arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and	 101.00820833867851
thought about those times because she had found out in Walker’s	 49.996230313522666
pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the	 15.409966682808971
halcyon days what they meant.	 77.201592069797
The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till	 39.15199362892063
at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no	 97.39161190688951
getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he	 114.2390424214355
could down towards the seaweedy rocks. Needless to say poor Tommy was	 97.52746995282367
not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was	 89.25029354722318
sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted	 68.98195081902111
the ball. Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries	 53.164321964653944
and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it	 44.036303530858675
to her please. The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then	 86.1069112281366
threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the	 83.0324102766554
slope and stopped right under Gerty’s skirt near the little pool by the	 57.59004376023578
rock. The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it	 101.94085888682517
away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she	 127.15136452073861
wished their stupid ball hadn’t come rolling down to her and she gave a	 92.9425149756253
kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.	 207.6209193377313
—If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.	 53.23484490294512
Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip. A delicate pink crept into her	 151.92828291486936
pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted	 69.64583200558971
her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball	 122.97962041118483
a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it	 64.32651487755224
down towards the shingle. Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else	 39.093868569002794
to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking. She	 45.93726851505272
felt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell,	 108.62657771688497
surging and flaming into her cheeks. Till then they had only exchanged	 75.93910896665756
glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she	 46.66710004722222
ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the	 54.16140931244894
twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had	 46.85591455375753
ever seen.	 182.31643410494803
Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted	 53.02211964395807
and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain	 68.926165928022
of original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray	 51.64032915737231
for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose. And	 33.326675238047756
careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many	 91.65083440018144
who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all	 65.18687555135403
that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told	 122.74404717840828
them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary,	 117.64431464329945
the most pious Virgin’s intercessory power that it was not recorded in	 40.97981524934662
any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever	 110.98072717296803
abandoned by her.	 35.4838219342301
The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of	 51.91801938196242
childhood are but as fleeting summer showers. Cissy Caffrey played with	 146.23365366975975
baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air.	 106.29001939074224
Peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was	 57.389823764861326
Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my	 194.19696502266768
word, didn’t the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say	 103.4012616436172
papa.	 22803.36024805148
—Say papa, baby. Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.	 9.249694223702162
And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for	 57.496171820330524
eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of	 85.18144080105398
health, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out	 49.99818276925968
to be something great, they said.	 163.80993149606073
—Haja ja ja haja.	 4.045570071155129
Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to	 71.99182705217615
sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried	 62.00518002120427
out, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half	 127.95665023508981
blanket the other way under him. Of course his infant majesty was most	 111.62786730092047
obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:	 56.30396099190609
—Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.	 4.206040932916629
And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks. It was all	 104.88073890548925
no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the	 109.48422034771978
geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave	 59.19496590977601
him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen	 17.22785423720452
was quickly appeased.	 201.68145779941057
Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out	 133.45508183300706
of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little	 92.6693652297352
brats of twins. She gazed out towards the distant sea. It was like the	 48.20130698479387
paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured	 31.312942575127437
chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out,	 67.18171154744026
the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and	 55.56975035711231
to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they	 62.396878829792115
burned in the church like a kind of waft. And while she gazed her heart	 56.53911740393611
went pitapat. Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning	 114.19384517373122
in his look. His eyes burned into her as though they would search her	 70.70574722393884
through and through, read her very soul. Wonderful eyes they were,	 217.4438289094953
superbly expressive, but could you trust them? People were so queer.	 68.21184002174296
She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face	 63.28590135773724
that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin	 52.63083771831419
Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred	 26.809808554257124
because she wasn’t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they	 55.880733600444586
two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see	 76.09868559384734
whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly _retroussé_ from where he	 80.29057456801785
was sitting. He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story	 76.87577264491914
of a haunting sorrow was written on his face. She would have given	 41.1659580378612
worlds to know what it was. He was looking up so intently, so still,	 58.217779688570666
and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel	 65.87772024522319
buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the	 42.908945880654215
toes down. She was glad that something told her to put on the	 56.44544035910943
transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was	 45.337312361204646
far away. Here was that of which she had so often dreamed. It was he	 75.1870026414738
who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him	 39.71150720263979
because she felt instinctively that he was like no-one else. The very	 61.03545053532583
heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she	 37.07107917852633
knew on the instant it was him. If he had suffered, more sinned against	 71.94397878768858
than sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked	 74.73352082315033
man, she cared not. Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could	 38.8229302064057
convert him easily if he truly loved her. There were wounds that wanted	 78.61545993994186
healing with heartbalm. She was a womanly woman not like other flighty	 38.42829047166588
girls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they	 133.92795949113133
hadn’t got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she	 165.0001384884218
could make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the	 67.24094147231183
past. Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man,	 83.9052182341497
crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for	 61.84602693605006
herself alone.	 241.37325392480935
Refuge of sinners. Comfortress of the afflicted. _Ora pro nobis_. Well	 29.451875834797917
has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy	 59.889280187599354
can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge	 66.01443183451896
for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her	 52.33838197962873
own heart. Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the	 52.6957407771212
stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue	 196.7382024993512
banners of the blessed Virgin’s sodality and Father Conroy was helping	 22.31964546216851
Canon O’Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes	 60.37504542334259
cast down. He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet	 224.44731134831056
and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever	 98.81840502925276
she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come	 60.3391335724293
to the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic. He told her that time	 38.91454161082144
when she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots	 38.296950777110304
of her hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was	 45.73296945216117
only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature’s laws, he	 61.92073931141532
said, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the	 66.40380020296067
nature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady	 85.50146688475495
herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to	 74.5481997625964
Thy Word. He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and	 121.50249641331595
thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design	 126.15117019810424
for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the	 71.70413912825441
mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little	 62.82788438398974
house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the	 88.34269243028166
forty hours’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a	 32.07545066622927
present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or	 65.77836881197767
some place.	 478.5462088487664
The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky	 43.2148515777635
threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it. Little	 120.05234809136536
monkeys common as ditchwater. Someone ought to take them and give them	 88.31686797078059
a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of	 52.68162379853065
them. And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they	 92.99138748656549
were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.	 158.63024864860148
—Jacky! Tommy!	 1072.1198770973697
Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very	 100.12063521506242
last time she’d ever bring them out. She jumped up and called them and	 57.52336181653122
she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had	 63.4785781891201
a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the	 81.56266493192463
thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn’t get it to grow	 48.118833793969934
long because it wasn’t natural so she could just go and throw her hat	 102.47905666649817
at it. She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn’t rip	 89.73037198070091
up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a	 55.04929526977403
lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece	 64.72447189312325
whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just	 78.25831666611877
because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see	 35.46881788536343
all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as	 30.321493148034175
possible. It would have served her just right if she had tripped up	 89.22427638597259
over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French	 138.78752461519755
heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble. _Tableau!_	 61.30798082600357
That would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that	 35.26049662217654
to witness.	 311.16091448327444
Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints,	 57.4143487951241
they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy	 45.92079539276616
handed the thurible to Canon O’Hanlon and he put in the incense and	 51.32122593290363
censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and	 15.624538398308994
she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she	 62.823591200451396
didn’t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a	 94.01654214217147
bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking	 73.92726863243242
that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O’Hanlon handed	 65.60765223824595
the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the	 24.47645003630104
Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the _Tantum ergo_ and she	 29.163445095697927
just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to	 86.64946525780915
the _Tantumer gosa cramen tum_. Three and eleven she paid for those	 78.46364621021206
stockings in Sparrow’s of George’s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday	 159.04020094230629
before Easter and there wasn’t a brack on them and that was what he was	 45.92842396948882
looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had	 125.23134715766417
neither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his	 118.16068473372292
head to see the difference for himself.	 104.73190780263228
Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with	 70.83311543365696
her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a	 82.9477343844488
streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought	 45.6595622525103
only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her	 62.48442162715912
petticoat hanging like a caricature. Gerty just took off her hat for a	 74.81878991102124
moment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown	 41.727883354666076
tresses was never seen on a girl’s shoulders—a radiant little vision,	 56.930078160830874
in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness. You would have to travel	 38.56284822699416
many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that. She	 100.91444062675247
could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes	 76.9471623668179
that set her tingling in every nerve. She put on her hat so that she	 51.55352050182356
could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster	 43.28602820976616
for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes. He was	 55.69752576510783
eying her as a snake eyes its prey. Her woman’s instinct told her that	 81.01503057789058
she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet	 136.55774043937672
swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a	 153.04387489216222
glorious rose.	 586.1178537360807
Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty,	 41.04205942867222
half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the	 116.76970814994115
baby. Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was	 80.67526264358905
why no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no	 121.29125205439692
concern of hers. And she said to Gerty:	 77.7890815817304
—A penny for your thoughts.	 95.98862852247218
—What? replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth. I	 76.42929890553582
was only wondering was it late.	 146.67597619596097
Because she wished to goodness they’d take the snottynosed twins and	 51.62494425924809
their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just	 49.431497850121715
gave a gentle hint about its being late. And when Cissy came up Edy	 147.7997231814649
asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was	 127.78066240947881
half past kissing time, time to kiss again. But Edy wanted to know	 92.52692734619595
because they were told to be in early.	 53.7313792238238
—Wait, said Cissy, I’ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what’s the	 189.49535892682434
time by his conundrum.	 79.15339441051961
So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his	 101.83750345850096
hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his	 82.38306762476759
watchchain, looking up at the church. Passionate nature though he was	 44.129706254663624
Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself. One moment	 53.140095089589735
he had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and	 44.4559285335784
the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol	 48.198184754233054
expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.	 124.41263573644211
Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the	 141.8942655205112
right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to	 41.99984447103503
it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry	 36.571794368337464
his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the	 121.20324891671382
sun was set. His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in	 102.31823021686942
measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones.	 18.862413389365667
Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said	 122.45406190600094
his waterworks were out of order.	 108.68535120921358
Then they sang the second verse of the _Tantum ergo_ and Canon O’Hanlon	 27.70080856037943
got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he	 27.594902071380037
told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire	 76.3636284865619
to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and	 41.03125614261912
she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the	 52.96476695210606
works and she swung her leg more in and out in time. It was getting	 100.15626449572656
darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was	 54.79725094610195
winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it	 63.52305170222002
back and put his hands back into his pockets. She felt a kind of a	 48.734203409813766
sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp	 34.347561777056804
and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on	 76.9433105609768
because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of	 43.229796536253616
the moon. His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her	 55.357409506363226
every contour, literally worshipping at her shrine. If ever there was	 35.488187119921335
undisguised admiration in a man’s passionate gaze it was there plain to	 88.23852197974453
be seen on that man’s face. It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you	 93.97270471097077
know it.	 250.71260652796792
Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty	 45.16782279871263
noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect	 161.617827955406
because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place	 36.976367058523685
to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins’ caps and tidied	 30.52466248089718
their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O’Hanlon	 67.865229771707
stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed	 23.250755973573387
him the card to read off and he read out _Panem de coelo praestitisti	 72.11495655280919
eis_ and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and	 49.774531840774216
asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just	 114.911499743034
answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she	 129.12402669613817
heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over. Gerty winced sharply.	 185.28817592549063
A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn	 98.20665689974106
immeasurable. It hurt—O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet	 127.9719208841171
way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded	 71.84225955977628
little cat she was. Gerty’s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but	 103.88681826659223
she fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless,	 93.8173692002721
so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of.	 145.9581230651912
She had loved him better than he knew. Lighthearted deceiver and fickle	 27.17768770067852
like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and	 54.644183705551335
for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears.	 53.42252587671078
Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she	 35.82135335538621
sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them	 37.18873233177554
to see.	 85.99606903615606
—O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head	 138.59492591912334
flashed up. I can throw my cap at who I like because it’s leap year.	 108.26770545824371
Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the	 32.65541177337268
ringdove, but they cut the silence icily. There was that in her young	 89.69167673625356
voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with. As	 114.3325306195256
for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck	 93.98955974157981
him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as	 81.18261230832115
much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a	 90.97038235329384
dozen pieces. And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him	 70.66416636101003
one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot.	 103.37855766474742
Miss puny little Edy’s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty	 159.06990621421565
could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a	 71.46712393537798
towering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft	 59.626823233986556
had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was	 48.446917252475096
something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and	 89.38154925245347
never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it	 60.485782584524905
so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.	 73.84710839690452
Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked	 55.06853123903399
in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because	 47.62574628449978
the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior. And Cissy told	 50.808490692793676
him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and	 78.9056558911499
baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and	 106.98767344696064
Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby,	 70.16255197752552
without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and	 84.00870368169744
sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib.	 34.62573502324438
—O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss. He has his bib destroyed.	 88.63623460081855
The slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set	 84.77739352018371
that little matter to rights.	 132.07221715691784
Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy	 76.33578448059954
asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was	 45.72237155475594
flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed	 143.37709336921316
it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction	 40.03845919989487
because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet	 50.43579951790907
seashore because Canon O’Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that	 39.914301316538584
Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the	 44.503814805402214
Blessed Sacrament in his hands.	 43.64058205782075
How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse	 60.62321061524705
of Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time	 68.08383454624226
a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither,	 23.1944486605961
thither, with a tiny lost cry. And she could see far away the lights of	 79.9924318392703
the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of	 39.70062115614218
paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the	 48.809996316944016
lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church	 66.21676286873824
grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked	 54.969794800775894
and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn	 44.218473220354845
his freewheel like she read in that book _The Lamplighter_ by Miss	 80.56582914397131
Cummins, author of _Mabel Vaughan_ and other tales. For Gerty had her	 18.211889635031444
dreams that no-one knew of. She loved to read poetry and when she got a	 113.383319515725
keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the	 42.66162341442822
coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of	 82.78636856535734
her toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was	 35.00696515603665
scrupulously neat and clean. It was there she kept her girlish treasure	 124.91522789378658
trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose	 30.02223406692219
scent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to	 25.458828356264444
change when her things came home from the wash and there were some	 99.26313797137958
beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in	 147.73285530989293
Hely’s of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if	 113.23666448658646
she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so	 38.79307787721552
deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening	 74.17110023249154
round the potherbs. _Art thou real, my ideal?_ it was called by Louis J	 123.50929566079839
Walsh, Magherafelt, and after there was something about _twilight, wilt	 50.737894226696945
thou ever?_ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient	 140.27421523086477
loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the	 53.96029926156264
years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one	 131.85150938391865
shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an	 61.880815632512146
accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it.	 91.4951939106406
But it must end, she felt. If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there	 53.904644823707955
would be no holding back for her. Love laughs at locksmiths. She would	 73.70694767970147
make the great sacrifice. Her every effort would be to share his	 94.06752930189863
thoughts. Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his	 78.54785227623931
days with happiness. There was the allimportant question and she was	 74.66449537031374
dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife	 103.44979424162032
or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land	 84.47502743874608
of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind. But	 131.0571084324694
even if—what then? Would it make a very great difference? From	 104.2802915161237
everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively	 64.90070185220304
recoiled. She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the	 77.41352773009407
accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and	 48.016841920311755
coarse men with no respect for a girl’s honour, degrading the sex and	 93.27534842008893
being taken up to the police station. No, no: not that. They would be	 53.046124835956284
just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other	 147.21000626580124
in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess. Perhaps it was	 34.629203148036
an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall. She	 63.06590428403786
thought she understood. She would try to understand him because men	 116.43589432491497
were so different. The old love was waiting, waiting with little white	 195.90469571351255
hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes. Heart of mine! She would	 106.96459598056335
follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he	 66.02564712336259
was her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was	 73.4630376224428
the master guide. Nothing else mattered. Come what might she would be	 128.98454315276257
wild, untrammelled, free.	 513.1950520571415
Canon O’Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and	 28.197834754224438
genuflected and the choir sang _Laudate Dominum omnes gentes_ and then	 22.890909800326256
he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and	 61.40340578462246
Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked	 45.404864268832256
wasn’t she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:	 88.03079489522581
—O, look, Cissy!	 163.15134447126462
And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over	 154.91707057385773
the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.	 107.10701302492319
—It’s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.	 26.30467195724058
And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church,	 55.51325300684902
helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy	 88.01378984331295
holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn’t fall running.	 111.43674870964665
—Come on, Gerty, Cissy called. It’s the bazaar fireworks.	 150.62136734956965
But Gerty was adamant. She had no intention of being at their beck and	 61.39800311535869
call. If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she	 109.16136490174787
could see from where she was. The eyes that were fastened upon her set	 112.32472799303426
her pulses tingling. She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance,	 55.3086966859164
and a light broke in upon her. Whitehot passion was in that face,	 138.4960208345934
passion silent as the grave, and it had made her his. At last they were	 92.56932615828114
left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he	 111.540476068165
could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of	 48.106726669652474
inflexible honour to his fingertips. His hands and face were working	 153.70576512700816
and a tremour went over her. She leaned back far to look up where the	 39.96502522881358
fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall	 122.76241610349835
back looking up and there was no-one to see only him and her when she	 77.3787262854856
revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply	 83.98932052375096
soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his	 38.77702540524117
heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of	 162.91512758734942
men like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead	 52.06003494935881
secret and made her swear she’d never about the gentleman lodger that	 113.70481209525423
was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had	 30.50813607826243
pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and	 47.53097014373288
she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine	 54.48065646764005
sometimes in the bed. But this was altogether different from a thing	 101.05869676961812
like that because there was all the difference because she could almost	 46.28101912091607
feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his	 112.44292911473578
handsome lips. Besides there was absolution so long as you didn’t do	 58.05964533057426
the other thing before being married and there ought to be women	 57.690394421718686
priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy	 236.45673568995736
Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes	 127.45818683916619
so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors’	 84.90632958959596
photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on	 31.00953944337109
the way it did.	 79.37042897265901
And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned	 38.1325952371554
back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent	 86.36580710700687
and they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was	 57.432083959137984
and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something	 49.97290777310736
queer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark. And	 93.01683794825051
she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in	 106.12002315409482
the tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went	 57.82359307606989
higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up	 115.37143447723967
after it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused	 88.13105214291934
with a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see	 43.02244051305332
her other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the	 36.96790387267092
skin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven,	 129.83615322882304
on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and	 67.7462292257938
then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was	 74.26869326054195
trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full	 141.52350988630175
view high up above her knee where no-one ever not even on the swing or	 84.15732079850505
wading and she wasn’t ashamed and he wasn’t either to look in that	 59.2186590361609
immodest way like that because he couldn’t resist the sight of the	 45.46757982757595
wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so	 177.09232658898839
immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking. She	 156.99577991530623
would fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms	 136.36409053245114
to him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a	 55.139176568801346
young girl’s love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry	 112.3715278989036
that has rung through the ages. And then a rocket sprang and bang shot	 99.46203283773606
blind blank and O! then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh	 69.54295517232293
of O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures and it gushed out of it a	 72.6901236622677
stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah! they were all	 91.96871062841538
greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet,	 136.48593190544702
soft!	 2303.703390164037
Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. Ah! She	 84.14879555375555
glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of	 62.90118961554874
piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl.	 46.226519593668336
He was leaning back against the rock behind. Leopold Bloom (for it is	 64.81710748590541
he) stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes.	 128.49185842135694
What a brute he had been! At it again? A fair unsullied soul had called	 104.1073996046859
to him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered? An utter cad he	 58.45267015101233
had been! He of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in	 56.33989627897701
those eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and	 67.23005267335122
sinned and wandered. Should a girl tell? No, a thousand times no. That	 234.2417388191515
was their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there	 66.93539081528462
was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly	 86.161100540847
through the evening to and fro and little bats don’t tell.	 53.67869072072439
Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to	 32.24577376158873
show what a great person she was: and then she cried:	 95.04036613855267
—Gerty! Gerty! We’re going. Come on. We can see from farther up.	 115.02403238140275
Gerty had an idea, one of love’s little ruses. She slipped a hand into	 94.81989839874235
her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of	 40.81694132746491
course without letting him and then slipped it back. Wonder if he’s too	 61.7493646806215
far to. She rose. Was it goodbye? No. She had to go but they would meet	 114.03145885442859
again, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her	 74.7046475744296
dream of yester eve. She drew herself up to her full height. Their	 93.93322083515997
souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her	 127.03686648515614
heart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet	 101.77926127452794
flowerlike face. She half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile,	 80.10851426530337
a smile that verged on tears, and then they parted.	 69.57826868207293
Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy,	 84.53801466465059
to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman. It was	 83.59344043320787
darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and	 73.55430688953659
slippy seaweed. She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic	 77.39186174729781
of her but with care and very slowly because—because Gerty MacDowell	 97.72120597160233
was...	 258.81000459233076
Tight boots? No. She’s lame! O!	 325.3479183864919
Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away. Poor girl! That’s why she’s	 53.602389710520846
left on the shelf and the others did a sprint. Thought something was	 75.13047685356072
wrong by the cut of her jib. Jilted beauty. A defect is ten times worse	 102.35757525841933
in a woman. But makes them polite. Glad I didn’t know it when she was	 51.99848832499902
on show. Hot little devil all the same. I wouldn’t mind. Curiosity like	 105.67490825682881
a nun or a negress or a girl with glasses. That squinty one is	 60.517495198130845
delicate. Near her monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish. I	 107.32997951875574
have such a bad headache today. Where did I put the letter? Yes, all	 71.90604181944624
right. All kinds of crazy longings. Licking pennies. Girl in Tranquilla	 59.43332293889214
convent that nun told me liked to smell rock oil. Virgins go mad in the	 69.15918982997245
end I suppose. Sister? How many women in Dublin have it today? Martha,	 101.75946718108013
she. Something in the air. That’s the moon. But then why don’t all	 83.25328406997572
women menstruate at the same time with the same moon, I mean? Depends	 45.849416010229284
on the time they were born I suppose. Or all start scratch then get out	 56.13549286113975
of step. Sometimes Molly and Milly together. Anyhow I got the best of	 156.7096146023234
that. Damned glad I didn’t do it in the bath this morning over her	 50.367978720855945
silly I will punish you letter. Made up for that tramdriver this	 77.86955989027692
morning. That gouger M’Coy stopping me to say nothing. And his wife	 86.57983354620866
engagement in the country valise, voice like a pickaxe. Thankful for	 33.09697902679277
small mercies. Cheap too. Yours for the asking. Because they want it	 144.75748543442992
themselves. Their natural craving. Shoals of them every evening poured	 111.18051483700657
out of offices. Reserve better. Don’t want it they throw it at you.	 81.16904908849996
Catch em alive, O. Pity they can’t see themselves. A dream of	 67.18283708240727
wellfilled hose. Where was that? Ah, yes. Mutoscope pictures in Capel	 140.17317870131427
street: for men only. Peeping Tom. Willy’s hat and what the girls did	 181.1913801552902
with it. Do they snapshot those girls or is it all a fake? _Lingerie_	 55.68231506641282
does it. Felt for the curves inside her _déshabillé._ Excites them also	 55.724091314457986
when they’re. I’m all clean come and dirty me. And they like dressing	 156.98487210829427
one another for the sacrifice. Milly delighted with Molly’s new blouse.	 117.33082673780167
At first. Put them all on to take them all off. Molly. Why I bought her	 127.58142809918552
the violet garters. Us too: the tie he wore, his lovely socks and	 186.19682529072588
turnedup trousers. He wore a pair of gaiters the night that first we	 68.61299196910998
met. His lovely shirt was shining beneath his what? of jet. Say a woman	 285.33757062069475
loses a charm with every pin she takes out. Pinned together. O, Mairy	 103.23731086011088
lost the pin of her. Dressed up to the nines for somebody. Fashion part	 66.78727503711646
of their charm. Just changes when you’re on the track of the secret.	 45.837578660578075
Except the east: Mary, Martha: now as then. No reasonable offer	 245.8352022179607
refused. She wasn’t in a hurry either. Always off to a fellow when they	 59.08153523619899
are. They never forget an appointment. Out on spec probably. They	 101.30167887655553
believe in chance because like themselves. And the others inclined to	 109.1944101095218
give her an odd dig. Girl friends at school, arms round each other’s	 197.70094129070253
necks or with ten fingers locked, kissing and whispering secrets about	 119.24694568309488
nothing in the convent garden. Nuns with whitewashed faces, cool coifs	 35.65523488482657
and their rosaries going up and down, vindictive too for what they	 89.11169985630488
can’t get. Barbed wire. Be sure now and write to me. And I’ll write to	 99.13377057773751
you. Now won’t you? Molly and Josie Powell. Till Mr Right comes along,	 111.86126008235294
then meet once in a blue moon. _Tableau!_ O, look who it is for the	 108.97306595375758
love of God! How are you at all? What have you been doing with	 84.84557589567085
yourself? Kiss and delighted to, kiss, to see you. Picking holes in	 101.0374178060355
each other’s appearance. You’re looking splendid. Sister souls. Showing	 314.38437036242027
their teeth at one another. How many have you left? Wouldn’t lend each	 108.02582814172793
other a pinch of salt.	 75.57543864244924
Ah!	 892.5304701208863
Devils they are when that’s coming on them. Dark devilish appearance.	 100.91052087303628
Molly often told me feel things a ton weight. Scratch the sole of my	 74.16502865045676
foot. O that way! O, that’s exquisite! Feel it myself too. Good to rest	 92.54903925709488
once in a way. Wonder if it’s bad to go with them then. Safe in one	 84.9481170420477
way. Turns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap. Something about withering	 251.07916191232835
plants I read in a garden. Besides they say if the flower withers she	 70.66849743889559
wears she’s a flirt. All are. Daresay she felt I. When you feel like	 120.66914284451603
that you often meet what you feel. Liked me or what? Dress they look	 119.57599567343279
at. Always know a fellow courting: collars and cuffs. Well cocks and	 56.067584162640344
lions do the same and stags. Same time might prefer a tie undone or	 88.68226219746657
something. Trousers? Suppose I when I was? No. Gently does it. Dislike	 201.6399461617891
rough and tumble. Kiss in the dark and never tell. Saw something in me.	 112.87588296679925
Wonder what. Sooner have me as I am than some poet chap with	 132.5162015123543
bearsgrease plastery hair, lovelock over his dexter optic. To aid	 26.576803601436715
gentleman in literary. Ought to attend to my appearance my age. Didn’t	 117.30433820785305
let her see me in profile. Still, you never know. Pretty girls and ugly	 60.471930910632345
men marrying. Beauty and the beast. Besides I can’t be so if Molly.	 107.28579449232288
Took off her hat to show her hair. Wide brim. Bought to hide her face,	 77.80725643346305
meeting someone might know her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers	 116.86991168857647
to smell. Hair strong in rut. Ten bob I got for Molly’s combings when	 105.04769277780161
we were on the rocks in Holles street. Why not? Suppose he gave her	 49.496597029429886
money. Why not? All a prejudice. She’s worth ten, fifteen, more, a	 186.8948297460499
pound. What? I think so. All that for nothing. Bold hand: Mrs Marion.	 136.4566501192246
Did I forget to write address on that letter like the postcard I sent	 91.03873933439243
to Flynn? And the day I went to Drimmie’s without a necktie. Wrangle	 39.4330937885686
with Molly it was put me off. No, I remember. Richie Goulding: he’s	 134.92503177914637
another. Weighs on his mind. Funny my watch stopped at half past four.	 84.95257277180808
Dust. Shark liver oil they use to clean. Could do it myself. Save. Was	 278.7744554891774
that just when he, she?	 161.27138765803724
O, he did. Into her. She did. Done.	 137.14578877658144
Ah!	 892.5304701208863
Mr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt. O Lord, that	 54.15860184558765
little limping devil. Begins to feel cold and clammy. Aftereffect not	 106.84212314069373
pleasant. Still you have to get rid of it someway. They don’t care.	 64.1654001240618
Complimented perhaps. Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night	 100.10658157384535
prayers with the kiddies. Well, aren’t they? See her as she is spoil	 55.917170728676574
all. Must have the stage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music.	 79.97913376534567
The name too. _Amours_ of actresses. Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud	 17.586285588698793
Branscombe. Curtain up. Moonlight silver effulgence. Maiden discovered	 208.27983224484313
with pensive bosom. Little sweetheart come and kiss me. Still, I feel.	 80.32101375091712
The strength it gives a man. That’s the secret of it. Good job I let	 73.76495201688432
off there behind the wall coming out of Dignam’s. Cider that was.	 52.63957795448922
Otherwise I couldn’t have. Makes you want to sing after. _Lacaus esant	 58.05051348079744
taratara_. Suppose I spoke to her. What about? Bad plan however if you	 68.297515263624
don’t know how to end the conversation. Ask them a question they ask	 84.81592936250605
you another. Good idea if you’re stuck. Gain time. But then you’re in a	 88.83451888196676
cart. Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and you see she’s	 79.13155984253521
on for it: good evening. O but the dark evening in the Appian way I	 76.513142620898
nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was. Whew! Girl in Meath	 94.85149479662165
street that night. All the dirty things I made her say. All wrong of	 200.18208275164326
course. My arks she called it. It’s so hard to find one who. Aho! If	 105.18194915447798
you don’t answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they	 55.66508621713004
harden. And kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings.	 54.41485758622451
Parrots. Press the button and the bird will squeak. Wish she hadn’t	 152.90840174411588
called me sir. O, her mouth in the dark! And you a married man with a	 64.5082963448599
single girl! That’s what they enjoy. Taking a man from another woman.	 105.43358216197215
Or even hear of it. Different with me. Glad to get away from other	 109.21643079121523
chap’s wife. Eating off his cold plate. Chap in the Burton today	 148.90788011655337
spitting back gumchewed gristle. French letter still in my pocketbook.	 85.04362153189834
Cause of half the trouble. But might happen sometime, I don’t think.	 197.96937764802993
Come in, all is prepared. I dreamt. What? Worst is beginning. How they	 90.6019470756575
change the venue when it’s not what they like. Ask you do you like	 65.60798238745603
mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who. Or ask you what	 102.27868081160925
someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped. Yet if I	 66.69017978333257
went the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that. Because I did.	 74.43608952846242
She too. Offend her. Then make it up. Pretend to want something	 106.72596210085747
awfully, then cry off for her sake. Flatters them. She must have been	 79.20024391367444
thinking of someone else all the time. What harm? Must since she came	 119.04354753003055
to the use of reason, he, he and he. First kiss does the trick. The	 110.30030049364336
propitious moment. Something inside them goes pop. Mushy like, tell by	 271.89271809686426
their eye, on the sly. First thoughts are best. Remember that till	 179.9732945499966
their dying day. Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the	 180.43472932891507
Moorish wall beside the gardens. Fifteen she told me. But her breasts	 122.80574639788072
were developed. Fell asleep then. After Glencree dinner that was when	 200.94069388860248
we drove home. Featherbed mountain. Gnashing her teeth in sleep. Lord	 183.70179578043115
mayor had his eye on her too. Val Dillon. Apoplectic.	 139.92926303422936
There she is with them down there for the fireworks. My fireworks. Up	 95.72639226845533
like a rocket, down like a stick. And the children, twins they must be,	 64.64819578705088
waiting for something to happen. Want to be grownups. Dressing in	 58.94260494637795
mother’s clothes. Time enough, understand all the ways of the world.	 75.43011306559458
And the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth. I knew she	 52.90739277184041
could whistle. Mouth made for that. Like Molly. Why that highclass	 285.40959721091065
whore in Jammet’s wore her veil only to her nose. Would you mind,	 167.31494758897483
please, telling me the right time? I’ll tell you the right time up a	 47.538023802938994
dark lane. Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for	 113.13407142203921
fat lips. Caressing the little boy too. Onlookers see most of the game.	 159.718239543386
Of course they understand birds, animals, babies. In their line.	 68.56679173157929
Didn’t look back when she was going down the strand. Wouldn’t give that	 65.1825404690517
satisfaction. Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls.	 14.063227351093373
Fine eyes she had, clear. It’s the white of the eye brings that out not	 94.82575723187175
so much the pupil. Did she know what I? Course. Like a cat sitting	 92.93422112425377
beyond a dog’s jump. Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high	 62.625901986585596
school drawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show. Call	 111.14887508925862
that innocence? Poor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her.	 88.00293531459316
Never see them sit on a bench marked _Wet Paint_. Eyes all over them.	 90.12047525534473
Look under the bed for what’s not there. Longing to get the fright of	 64.54119032176948
their lives. Sharp as needles they are. When I said to Molly the man at	 83.19070539412559
the corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like,	 91.70638043345753
twigged at once he had a false arm. Had, too. Where do they get that?	 64.84199181953531
Typist going up Roger Greene’s stairs two at a time to show her	 111.34995838772366
understandings. Handed down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean.	 135.36906341764018
Bred in the bone. Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the	 31.07141094959268
mirror to save the ironing. Best place for an ad to catch a woman’s eye	 96.90011001574294
on a mirror. And when I sent her for Molly’s Paisley shawl to	 60.26495414536325
Prescott’s by the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her	 49.406039366613676
stocking! Clever little minx. I never told her. Neat way she carries	 51.217309271536664
parcels too. Attract men, small thing like that. Holding up her hand,	 127.35836677841402
shaking it, to let the blood flow back when it was red. Who did you	 136.15252066693012
learn that from? Nobody. Something the nurse taught me. O, don’t they	 137.20494473846563
know! Three years old she was in front of Molly’s dressingtable, just	 78.63939996471174
before we left Lombard street west. Me have a nice pace. Mullingar. Who	 34.32075399978388
knows? Ways of the world. Young student. Straight on her pins anyway	 57.04646934436503
not like the other. Still she was game. Lord, I am wet. Devil you are.	 85.59387717114258
Swell of her calf. Transparent stockings, stretched to breaking point.	 116.25654275808618
Not like that frump today. A. E. Rumpled stockings. Or the one in	 95.40506055355489
Grafton street. White. Wow! Beef to the heel.	 73.58534292488997
A monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles. Zrads	 22.732449190380454
and zrads, zrads, zrads. And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see	 34.79325123977705
and Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the	 82.76920118433053
rocks. Will she? Watch! Watch! See! Looked round. She smelt an onion.	 239.25735190520962
Darling, I saw, your. I saw all.	 195.7162499235786
Lord!	 1934.5542720362105
Did me good all the same. Off colour after Kiernan’s, Dignam’s. For	 167.09672324726145
this relief much thanks. In _Hamlet,_ that is. Lord! It was all things	 101.85128921093305
combined. Excitement. When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of	 40.409587713218855
my tongue. Your head it simply swirls. He’s right. Might have made a	 84.89140319186777
worse fool of myself however. Instead of talking about nothing. Then I	 105.13897626528525
will tell you all. Still it was a kind of language between us. It	 47.650965402765706
couldn’t be? No, Gerty they called her. Might be false name however	 124.47661005905346
like my name and the address Dolphin’s barn a blind.	 58.98056615813024
Her maiden name was Jemina Brown	 114.78003308764555
And she lived with her mother in Irishtown.	 79.7289887000669
Place made me think of that I suppose. All tarred with the same brush.	 61.56118059297176
Wiping pens in their stockings. But the ball rolled down to her as if	 76.9015777321831
it understood. Every bullet has its billet. Course I never could throw	 135.77694370517162
anything straight at school. Crooked as a ram’s horn. Sad however	 117.1176201787329
because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping	 47.31536299793083
and papa’s pants will soon fit Willy and fuller’s earth for the baby	 68.24500018981233
when they hold him out to do ah ah. No soft job. Saves them. Keeps them	 84.24732553900274
out of harm’s way. Nature. Washing child, washing corpse. Dignam.	 153.799400610152
Children’s hands always round them. Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even	 147.45555444376274
closed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds.	 34.215147631902894
Oughtn’t to have given that child an empty teat to suck. Fill it up	 36.68366569075776
with wind. Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy. Must call to the hospital. Wonder is	 117.23944085516776
nurse Callan there still. She used to look over some nights when Molly	 65.9076686218218
was in the Coffee Palace. That young doctor O’Hare I noticed her	 61.11978416422515
brushing his coat. And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too,	 69.05730608712115
marriageable. Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City	 52.0202091912041
Arms. Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat.	 107.5657629287766
Have that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose. Then ask in	 61.389614461212396
the morning: was I drunk last night? Bad policy however to fault the	 100.6666000964915
husband. Chickens come home to roost. They stick by one another like	 82.33584755664914
glue. Maybe the women’s fault also. That’s where Molly can knock spots	 139.39236187475498
off them. It’s the blood of the south. Moorish. Also the form, the	 80.3407687212712
figure. Hands felt for the opulent. Just compare for instance those	 70.88421351800453
others. Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard. Allow me to	 52.84480049324042
introduce my. Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript,	 91.59550076276187
wouldn’t know what to call her. Always see a fellow’s weak point in his	 125.73790073044472
wife. Still there’s destiny in it, falling in love. Have their own	 140.82089985494994
secrets between them. Chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman	 127.84603295982399
didn’t take them in hand. Then little chits of girls, height of a	 72.36649686344676
shilling in coppers, with little hubbies. As God made them he matched	 59.109006549120586
them. Sometimes children turn out well enough. Twice nought makes one.	 197.61731021827453
Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride. Marry in May and repent	 113.30222033744626
in December. This wet is very unpleasant. Stuck. Well the foreskin is	 107.77874719355454
not back. Better detach.	 322.6701304912949
Ow!	 10132.014539964408
Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket. Long and the	 37.43153061286511
short of it. Big he and little she. Very strange about my watch.	 250.0597693485717
Wristwatches are always going wrong. Wonder is there any magnetic	 61.98026096213191
influence between the person because that was about the time he. Yes, I	 67.72993474637033
suppose, at once. Cat’s away, the mice will play. I remember looking in	 131.96251111117888
Pill lane. Also that now is magnetism. Back of everything magnetism.	 93.07328039742555
Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled. That causes movement.	 261.34525836530213
And time, well that’s the time the movement takes. Then if one thing	 144.02840890321275
stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit. Because it’s all	 134.82383020858975
arranged. Magnetic needle tells you what’s going on in the sun, the	 35.40192131129727
stars. Little piece of steel iron. When you hold out the fork. Come.	 103.70250167606726
Come. Tip. Woman and man that is. Fork and steel. Molly, he. Dress up	 178.75299433644574
and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if	 97.5315093862111
you’re a man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look	 76.50808222680162
and if you have any guts in you. Tip. Have to let fly.	 61.17610526409436
Wonder how is she feeling in that region. Shame all put on before third	 84.09371489744007
person. More put out about a hole in her stocking. Molly, her underjaw	 114.92798979775985
stuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at	 89.72431025834102
the horse show. And when the painters were in Lombard street west. Fine	 50.04358876249884
voice that fellow had. How Giuglini began. Smell that I did. Like	 196.97606419114115
flowers. It was too. Violets. Came from the turpentine probably in the	 45.23061210019814
paint. Make their own use of everything. Same time doing it scraped her	 111.7684994320196
slipper on the floor so they wouldn’t hear. But lots of them can’t kick	 66.65933246713747
the beam, I think. Keep that thing up for hours. Kind of a general all	 128.5003570730548
round over me and half down my back.	 465.7276243266967
Wait. Hm. Hm. Yes. That’s her perfume. Why she waved her hand. I leave	 57.45160449723729
you this to think of me when I’m far away on the pillow. What is it?	 104.21831576971724
Heliotrope? No. Hyacinth? Hm. Roses, I think. She’d like scent of that	 51.52861187217713
kind. Sweet and cheap: soon sour. Why Molly likes opoponax. Suits her,	 269.19039735805677
with a little jessamine mixed. Her high notes and her low notes. At the	 77.07019064910249
dance night she met him, dance of the hours. Heat brought it out. She	 125.83985697043269
was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before. Good	 114.15386155492493
conductor, is it? Or bad? Light too. Suppose there’s some connection.	 109.47651441904962
For instance if you go into a cellar where it’s dark. Mysterious thing	 70.82773584257588
too. Why did I smell it only now? Took its time in coming like herself,	 187.23632727310118
slow but sure. Suppose it’s ever so many millions of tiny grains blown	 128.593202281618
across. Yes, it is. Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this	 81.22612363618106
morning, smell them leagues off. Tell you what it is. It’s like a fine	 88.46262393879005
fine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you	 73.30873586076099
call it gossamer, and they’re always spinning it out of them, fine as	 53.1857744550127
anything, like rainbow colours without knowing it. Clings to everything	 122.2765069890053
she takes off. Vamp of her stockings. Warm shoe. Stays. Drawers: little	 80.16657154665091
kick, taking them off. Byby till next time. Also the cat likes to sniff	 72.30483726827012
in her shift on the bed. Know her smell in a thousand. Bathwater too.	 104.74626825726851
Reminds me of strawberries and cream. Wonder where it is really. There	 99.82858343205298
or the armpits or under the neck. Because you get it out of all holes	 93.59715816226716
and corners. Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something.	 124.39225213396497
Muskrat. Bag under their tails. One grain pour off odour for years.	 128.66721305852397
Dogs at each other behind. Good evening. Evening. How do you sniff? Hm.	 129.14336932740486
Hm. Very well, thank you. Animals go by that. Yes now, look at it that	 83.89507526087694
way. We’re the same. Some women, instance, warn you off when they have	 110.7689457559133
their period. Come near. Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on.	 91.91298866728582
Like what? Potted herrings gone stale or. Boof! Please keep off the	 155.9819955949033
grass.	 5119.248157295014
Perhaps they get a man smell off us. What though? Cigary gloves long	 182.22776232629002
John had on his desk the other day. Breath? What you eat and drink	 179.09589038370333
gives that. No. Mansmell, I mean. Must be connected with that because	 63.50183352175919
priests that are supposed to be are different. Women buzz round it like	 138.18854032448206
flies round treacle. Railed off the altar get on to it at any cost. The	 106.79349494167113
tree of forbidden priest. O, father, will you? Let me be the first to.	 115.75952688140954
That diffuses itself all through the body, permeates. Source of life.	 52.33142033552702
And it’s extremely curious the smell. Celery sauce. Let me.	 207.1385372680857
Mr Bloom inserted his nose. Hm. Into the. Hm. Opening of his waistcoat.	 33.5423910554211
Almonds or. No. Lemons it is. Ah no, that’s the soap.	 57.77723758560336
O by the by that lotion. I knew there was something on my mind. Never	 123.03942644720986
went back and the soap not paid. Dislike carrying bottles like that hag	 112.48196666628988
this morning. Hynes might have paid me that three shillings. I could	 66.62859985680898
mention Meagher’s just to remind him. Still if he works that paragraph.	 82.27892353372155
Two and nine. Bad opinion of me he’ll have. Call tomorrow. How much do	 78.12526950806104
I owe you? Three and nine? Two and nine, sir. Ah. Might stop him giving	 141.64390446645308
credit another time. Lose your customers that way. Pubs do. Fellows run	 115.3164894577137
up a bill on the slate and then slinking around the back streets into	 57.510461286909695
somewhere else.	 4191.001217134847
Here’s this nobleman passed before. Blown in from the bay. Just went as	 256.16266091223565
far as turn back. Always at home at dinnertime. Looks mangled out: had	 219.58081063188135
a good tuck in. Enjoying nature now. Grace after meals. After supper	 101.30824497411426
walk a mile. Sure he has a small bank balance somewhere, government	 176.27535958885485
sit. Walk after him now make him awkward like those newsboys me today.	 149.54614084108334
Still you learn something. See ourselves as others see us. So long as	 96.51836947449081
women don’t mock what matter? That’s the way to find out. Ask yourself	 83.20661556677355
who is he now. _The Mystery Man on the Beach_, prize titbit story by Mr	 114.81928613421705
Leopold Bloom. Payment at the rate of one guinea per column. And that	 37.06146476412995
fellow today at the graveside in the brown macintosh. Corns on his	 33.43155434461294
kismet however. Healthy perhaps absorb all the. Whistle brings rain	 144.47388409477642
they say. Must be some somewhere. Salt in the Ormond damp. The body	 55.85343603634793
feels the atmosphere. Old Betty’s joints are on the rack. Mother	 42.84501647505358
Shipton’s prophecy that is about ships around they fly in the	 38.940692428504136
twinkling. No. Signs of rain it is. The royal reader. And distant hills	 91.55029740426602
seem coming nigh.	 457.79856241429053
Howth. Bailey light. Two, four, six, eight, nine. See. Has to change or	 433.84717430362645
they might think it a house. Wreckers. Grace Darling. People afraid of	 80.76562693301321
the dark. Also glowworms, cyclists: lightingup time. Jewels diamonds	 32.68668719440602
flash better. Women. Light is a kind of reassuring. Not going to hurt	 100.35034513794635
you. Better now of course than long ago. Country roads. Run you through	 144.45371954622948
the small guts for nothing. Still two types there are you bob against.	 129.4966623360703
Scowl or smile. Pardon! Not at all. Best time to spray plants too in	 116.66272540426732
the shade after the sun. Some light still. Red rays are longest.	 156.07218564395728
Roygbiv Vance taught us: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo,	 67.168747076217
violet. A star I see. Venus? Can’t tell yet. Two. When three it’s	 440.0270616284827
night. Were those nightclouds there all the time? Looks like a phantom	 70.58579739600232
ship. No. Wait. Trees are they? An optical illusion. Mirage. Land of	 133.41459793106543
the setting sun this. Homerule sun setting in the southeast. My native	 112.04609457387824
land, goodnight.	 118.07196590691738
Dew falling. Bad for you, dear, to sit on that stone. Brings on white	 163.63021359943858
fluxions. Never have little baby then less he was big strong fight his	 121.74458281532114
way up through. Might get piles myself. Sticks too like a summer cold,	 315.2818066046284
sore on the mouth. Cut with grass or paper worst. Friction of the	 106.03310377096867
position. Like to be that rock she sat on. O sweet little, you don’t	 247.35215275291904
know how nice you looked. I begin to like them at that age. Green	 149.12391659621784
apples. Grab at all that offer. Suppose it’s the only time we cross	 58.334074807569735
legs, seated. Also the library today: those girl graduates. Happy	 212.55150083258957
chairs under them. But it’s the evening influence. They feel all that.	 111.31969417515492
Open like flowers, know their hours, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichokes,	 338.2953817855474
in ballrooms, chandeliers, avenues under the lamps. Nightstock in Mat	 18.870524647003528
Dillon’s garden where I kissed her shoulder. Wish I had a full length	 109.08595700820068
oilpainting of her then. June that was too I wooed. The year returns.	 58.76838081105529
History repeats itself. Ye crags and peaks I’m with you once again.	 136.16142952308965
Life, love, voyage round your own little world. And now? Sad about her	 196.59862857390394
lame of course but must be on your guard not to feel too much pity.	 58.3958362618399
They take advantage.	 111.03903335729836
All quiet on Howth now. The distant hills seem. Where we. The	 403.1310456410111
rhododendrons. I am a fool perhaps. He gets the plums, and I the	 60.91566077484524
plumstones. Where I come in. All that old hill has seen. Names change:	 114.85005531801482
that’s all. Lovers: yum yum.	 34.07736582061741
Tired I feel now. Will I get up? O wait. Drained all the manhood out of	 110.78533645894007
me, little wretch. She kissed me. Never again. My youth. Only once it	 178.7395620024108
comes. Or hers. Take the train there tomorrow. No. Returning not the	 155.82373973222494
same. Like kids your second visit to a house. The new I want. Nothing	 150.96932390868395
new under the sun. Care of P. O. Dolphin’s Barn. Are you not happy in	 61.90020180016188
your? Naughty darling. At Dolphin’s barn charades in Luke Doyle’s	 25.990521048575552
house. Mat Dillon and his bevy of daughters: Tiny, Atty, Floey, Maimy,	 52.10474322908208
Louy, Hetty. Molly too. Eightyseven that was. Year before we. And the	 68.83193818208669
old major, partial to his drop of spirits. Curious she an only child, I	 97.95118772112005
an only child. So it returns. Think you’re escaping and run into	 90.32117699623427
yourself. Longest way round is the shortest way home. And just when he	 95.10568643630512
and she. Circus horse walking in a ring. Rip van Winkle we played. Rip:	 53.60108067154882
tear in Henny Doyle’s overcoat. Van: breadvan delivering. Winkle:	 129.28478907959507
cockles and periwinkles. Then I did Rip van Winkle coming back. She	 60.82763039257612
leaned on the sideboard watching. Moorish eyes. Twenty years asleep in	 34.59557993888045
Sleepy Hollow. All changed. Forgotten. The young are old. His gun rusty	 406.9333688218813
from the dew.	 13.366813375402623
Ba. What is that flying about? Swallow? Bat probably. Thinks I’m a	 121.84592321274519
tree, so blind. Have birds no smell? Metempsychosis. They believed you	 130.80909224423382
could be changed into a tree from grief. Weeping willow. Ba. There he	 105.80170757784411
goes. Funny little beggar. Wonder where he lives. Belfry up there. Very	 133.30730167975338
likely. Hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity. Bell scared him	 92.04322320517677
out, I suppose. Mass seems to be over. Could hear them all at it. Pray	 83.63403065968285
for us. And pray for us. And pray for us. Good idea the repetition.	 19.535142480920562
Same thing with ads. Buy from us. And buy from us. Yes, there’s the	 119.97827878227483
light in the priest’s house. Their frugal meal. Remember about the	 76.01582492334428
mistake in the valuation when I was in Thom’s. Twentyeight it is. Two	 46.29685562636328
houses they have. Gabriel Conroy’s brother is curate. Ba. Again. Wonder	 169.70253853165383
why they come out at night like mice. They’re a mixed breed. Birds are	 152.01617111836106
like hopping mice. What frightens them, light or noise? Better sit	 119.4285771300803
still. All instinct like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of	 84.12446757664331
a jar by throwing in pebbles. Like a little man in a cloak he is with	 80.95716001891296
tiny hands. Weeny bones. Almost see them shimmering, kind of a bluey	 83.9435815211911
white. Colours depend on the light you see. Stare the sun for example	 48.59013593314175
like the eagle then look at a shoe see a blotch blob yellowish. Wants	 51.63992925037135
to stamp his trademark on everything. Instance, that cat this morning	 94.06116781142039
on the staircase. Colour of brown turf. Say you never see them with	 71.78435980645132
three colours. Not true. That half tabbywhite tortoiseshell in the	 71.7113046048736
_City Arms_ with the letter em on her forehead. Body fifty different	 48.05507629183279
colours. Howth a while ago amethyst. Glass flashing. That’s how that	 416.1267654311908
wise man what’s his name with the burning glass. Then the heather goes	 89.35698816384405
on fire. It can’t be tourists’ matches. What? Perhaps the sticks dry	 120.2269803900225
rub together in the wind and light. Or broken bottles in the furze act	 93.36824026953927
as a burning glass in the sun. Archimedes. I have it! My memory’s not	 44.90699303118292
so bad.	 185.52915593996633
Ba. Who knows what they’re always flying for. Insects? That bee last	 80.35290244953163
week got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling. Might be	 67.54645511728275
the one bit me, come back to see. Birds too. Never find out. Or what	 101.86926167848416
they say. Like our small talk. And says she and says he. Nerve they	 98.98646081931456
have to fly over the ocean and back. Lots must be killed in storms,	 74.34314595898236
telegraph wires. Dreadful life sailors have too. Big brutes of	 138.8303361365973
oceangoing steamers floundering along in the dark, lowing out like	 32.27343736402193
seacows. _Faugh a ballagh!_ Out of that, bloody curse to you! Others in	 41.990017511020824
vessels, bit of a handkerchief sail, pitched about like snuff at a wake	 110.99580955807443
when the stormy winds do blow. Married too. Sometimes away for years at	 111.80629602803278
the ends of the earth somewhere. No ends really because it’s round.	 82.19741144482012
Wife in every port they say. She has a good job if she minds it till	 73.32814934224994
Johnny comes marching home again. If ever he does. Smelling the tail	 135.12231680482512
end of ports. How can they like the sea? Yet they do. The anchor’s	 50.899194283094026
weighed. Off he sails with a scapular or a medal on him for luck. Well.	 32.41268947191233
And the tephilim no what’s this they call it poor papa’s father had on	 47.28802258055748
his door to touch. That brought us out of the land of Egypt and into	 68.53221469586532
the house of bondage. Something in all those superstitions because when	 86.7266902395118
you go out never know what dangers. Hanging on to a plank or astride of	 43.468806169446815
a beam for grim life, lifebelt round him, gulping salt water, and	 104.96714388257057
that’s the last of his nibs till the sharks catch hold of him. Do fish	 78.38427605656743
ever get seasick?	 251.8098779691717
Then you have a beautiful calm without a cloud, smooth sea, placid,	 81.25413438160813
crew and cargo in smithereens, Davy Jones’ locker, moon looking down so	 100.55394199712796
peaceful. Not my fault, old cockalorum.	 54.04755369432146
A last lonely candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in search of	 66.35030027457705
funds for Mercer’s hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster of	 29.195418928305084
violet but one white stars. They floated, fell: they faded. The	 297.92164748122593
shepherd’s hour: the hour of folding: hour of tryst. From house to	 94.6557271595707
house, giving his everwelcome double knock, went the nine o’clock	 228.53692029701824
postman, the glowworm’s lamp at his belt gleaming here and there	 54.5363887815405
through the laurel hedges. And among the five young trees a hoisted	 73.06167754324768
lintstock lit the lamp at Leahy’s terrace. By screens of lighted	 83.03201237610565
windows, by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: _Evening	 202.4116865784346
Telegraph, stop press edition! Result of the Gold Cup races!_ and from	 40.35114026358889
the door of Dignam’s house a boy ran out and called. Twittering the bat	 83.08124846377618
flew here, flew there. Far out over the sands the coming surf crept,	 82.7706972812241
grey. Howth settled for slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum	 87.54845155225425
rhododendrons (he was old) and felt gladly the night breeze lift,	 110.67315280650742
ruffle his fell of ferns. He lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep	 104.2038676719815
and slowly breathing, slumberous but awake. And far on Kish bank the	 82.06851830781294
anchored lightship twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.	 17.49145009455963
Life those chaps out there must have, stuck in the same spot. Irish	 76.95912503728181
Lights board. Penance for their sins. Coastguards too. Rocket and	 99.48234395145228
breeches buoy and lifeboat. Day we went out for the pleasure cruise in	 70.17212950327043
the Erin’s King, throwing them the sack of old papers. Bears in the	 30.238401001907185
zoo. Filthy trip. Drunkards out to shake up their livers. Puking	 20.228642482873507
overboard to feed the herrings. Nausea. And the women, fear of God in	 51.284462892683145
their faces. Milly, no sign of funk. Her blue scarf loose, laughing.	 69.68439882823965
Don’t know what death is at that age. And then their stomachs clean.	 102.56294103979636
But being lost they fear. When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin. I	 118.99807408579379
didn’t want to. Mamma! Mamma! Babes in the wood. Frightening them with	 48.06211916250178
masks too. Throwing them up in the air to catch them. I’ll murder you.	 41.80703178347731
Is it only half fun? Or children playing battle. Whole earnest. How can	 144.24882846382275
people aim guns at each other. Sometimes they go off. Poor kids! Only	 65.88115158346052
troubles wildfire and nettlerash. Calomel purge I got her for that.	 37.840780585021356
After getting better asleep with Molly. Very same teeth she has. What	 232.65339623391068
do they love? Another themselves? But the morning she chased her with	 92.39175717501543
the umbrella. Perhaps so as not to hurt. I felt her pulse. Ticking.	 85.87558573934278
Little hand it was: now big. Dearest Papli. All that the hand says when	 133.06672016088854
you touch. Loved to count my waistcoat buttons. Her first stays I	 88.53238308885626
remember. Made me laugh to see. Little paps to begin with. Left one is	 202.1265298861904
more sensitive, I think. Mine too. Nearer the heart? Padding themselves	 139.74625140241983
out if fat is in fashion. Her growing pains at night, calling, wakening	 207.32225161837408
me. Frightened she was when her nature came on her first. Poor child!	 119.07028273204806
Strange moment for the mother too. Brings back her girlhood. Gibraltar.	 197.47894630750233
Looking from Buena Vista. O’Hara’s tower. The seabirds screaming. Old	 66.10547784599767
Barbary ape that gobbled all his family. Sundown, gunfire for the men	 62.43781668779871
to cross the lines. Looking out over the sea she told me. Evening like	 106.96915815026655
this, but clear, no clouds. I always thought I’d marry a lord or a rich	 114.39533243065773
gentleman coming with a private yacht. _Buenas noches, señorita. El	 36.93139485064778
hombre ama la muchacha hermosa_. Why me? Because you were so foreign	 47.846858733744504
from the others.	 85.85004015129027
Better not stick here all night like a limpet. This weather makes you	 74.05119569691175
dull. Must be getting on for nine by the light. Go home. Too late for	 126.4615861366175
_Leah, Lily of Killarney._ No. Might be still up. Call to the hospital	 88.93799958312538
to see. Hope she’s over. Long day I’ve had. Martha, the bath, funeral,	 163.984822173559
house of Keyes, museum with those goddesses, Dedalus’ song. Then that	 179.24090371602952
bawler in Barney Kiernan’s. Got my own back there. Drunken ranters what	 53.035818741817096
I said about his God made him wince. Mistake to hit back. Or? No. Ought	 179.40167196969998
to go home and laugh at themselves. Always want to be swilling in	 56.95882076104292
company. Afraid to be alone like a child of two. Suppose he hit me.	 79.94783337149612
Look at it other way round. Not so bad then. Perhaps not to hurt he	 71.88833691787731
meant. Three cheers for Israel. Three cheers for the sister-in-law he	 51.079111845169386
hawked about, three fangs in her mouth. Same style of beauty.	 67.6304101474374
Particularly nice old party for a cup of tea. The sister of the wife of	 49.32372497842627
the wild man of Borneo has just come to town. Imagine that in the early	 66.25610845904542
morning at close range. Everyone to his taste as Morris said when he	 173.55408155188468
kissed the cow. But Dignam’s put the boots on it. Houses of mourning so	 164.9762598936331
depressing because you never know. Anyhow she wants the money. Must	 77.77583353379686
call to those Scottish Widows as I promised. Strange name. Takes it for	 66.94421519348933
granted we’re going to pop off first. That widow on Monday was it	 60.35878661008046
outside Cramer’s that looked at me. Buried the poor husband but	 82.3426585773959
progressing favourably on the premium. Her widow’s mite. Well? What do	 19.925184376743736
you expect her to do? Must wheedle her way along. Widower I hate to	 83.8787804306311
see. Looks so forlorn. Poor man O’Connor wife and five children	 226.4959877124067
poisoned by mussels here. The sewage. Hopeless. Some good matronly	 151.46216885791347
woman in a porkpie hat to mother him. Take him in tow, platter face and	 64.91175304508023
a large apron. Ladies’ grey flannelette bloomers, three shillings a	 69.78199311120437
pair, astonishing bargain. Plain and loved, loved for ever, they say.	 302.77785554729536
Ugly: no woman thinks she is. Love, lie and be handsome for tomorrow we	 106.86481462425665
die. See him sometimes walking about trying to find out who played the	 115.84043213383306
trick. U. p: up. Fate that is. He, not me. Also a shop often noticed.	 106.19807349660012
Curse seems to dog it. Dreamt last night? Wait. Something confused. She	 117.16971308149475
had red slippers on. Turkish. Wore the breeches. Suppose she does?	 102.67521388871283
Would I like her in pyjamas? Damned hard to answer. Nannetti’s gone.	 164.54464352491874
Mailboat. Near Holyhead by now. Must nail that ad of Keyes’s. Work	 119.0254102247816
Hynes and Crawford. Petticoats for Molly. She has something to put in	 123.46781056465427
them. What’s that? Might be money.	 61.983425625771126
Mr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of paper on the strand. He	 42.11622529968225
brought it near his eyes and peered. Letter? No. Can’t read. Better go.	 150.58231438823526
Better. I’m tired to move. Page of an old copybook. All those holes and	 70.29338378880446
pebbles. Who could count them? Never know what you find. Bottle with	 113.77266773560713
story of a treasure in it, thrown from a wreck. Parcels post. Children	 100.29498457232167
always want to throw things in the sea. Trust? Bread cast on the	 95.5205772359201
waters. What’s this? Bit of stick.	 285.11892763641333
O! Exhausted that female has me. Not so young now. Will she come here	 111.30616997686116
tomorrow? Wait for her somewhere for ever. Must come back. Murderers	 189.9636058872249
do. Will I?	 216.74669475226736
Mr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot. Write	 75.75181850889793
a message for her. Might remain. What?	 97.18437521399247
I.	 90.43075128797952
Some flatfoot tramp on it in the morning. Useless. Washed away. Tide	 87.42707118112627
comes here. Saw a pool near her foot. Bend, see my face there, dark	 119.62315260734665
mirror, breathe on it, stirs. All these rocks with lines and scars and	 72.93954175252075
letters. O, those transparent! Besides they don’t know. What is the	 63.55993081906644
meaning of that other world. I called you naughty boy because I do not	 37.68011014484525
like.	 487.1887436877667
AM. A.	 220.3442773799874
No room. Let it go.	 217.29490143477886
Mr Bloom effaced the letters with his slow boot. Hopeless thing sand.	 53.087908065579356
Nothing grows in it. All fades. No fear of big vessels coming up here.	 71.45663833514662
Except Guinness’s barges. Round the Kish in eighty days. Done half by	 191.24811272854987
design.	 19113.524753552
He flung his wooden pen away. The stick fell in silted sand, stuck. Now	 76.1827946291489
if you were trying to do that for a week on end you couldn’t. Chance.	 50.28897697194699
We’ll never meet again. But it was lovely. Goodbye, dear. Thanks. Made	 100.09301062153317
me feel so young.	 152.92832997549587
Short snooze now if I had. Must be near nine. Liverpool boat long gone.	 96.2744135343921
Not even the smoke. And she can do the other. Did too. And Belfast. I	 132.41034224223662
won’t go. Race there, race back to Ennis. Let him. Just close my eyes a	 93.70414382718552
moment. Won’t sleep, though. Half dream. It never comes the same. Bat	 201.23478468716584
again. No harm in him. Just a few.	 117.18487069309002

A bat flew. Here. There. Here. Far in the grey a bell chimed. Mr Bloom	 64.20386671003051
with open mouth, his left boot sanded sideways, leaned, breathed. Just	 245.50789231335358

Universally that person’s acumen is esteemed very little perceptive	 27.33033857122002
concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitably by	 69.0544425103533
mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that	 26.96394766476494
which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in	 76.19054962240429
them high mind’s ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain	 12.72849601971067
when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being	 98.80817301899671
equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more	 62.05881650306106
efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have	 61.37523581695479
progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent	 30.138753934291998
continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when	 90.8523057470494
fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent	 46.07603430869379
nature’s incorrupted benefaction. For who is there who anything of some	 149.49841601648058
significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior	 70.87114651800833
splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or	 12.7076424563862
on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to perceive	 106.1498521501588
that as no nature’s boon can contend against the bounty of increase so	 107.45662582688465
it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and	 97.27878571883556
admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past	 34.31394612035427
been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not	 95.15109592903221
with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have	 68.78451535316401
gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to	 18.907518404267943
that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who	 41.69495209189106
would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence	 53.730508014763224
can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel	 88.15676976678793
simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy	 31.832404724309995
of abundance or with diminution’s menace that exalted of reiteratedly	 20.600760787241477
procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined?	 20.158373633081712
It is not why therefore we shall wonder if, as the best historians	 72.77731172476818
relate, among the Celts, who nothing that was not in its nature	 62.44529900473835

Not to speak of hostels, leperyards, sweating chambers, plaguegraves,	 11.864227084563534
their greatest doctors, the O’Shiels, the O’Hickeys, the O’Lees, have	 40.507140679964095
sedulously set down the divers methods by which the sick and the	 46.23648251976111
relapsed found again health whether the malady had been the trembling	 96.43262263987411
withering or loose boyconnell flux. Certainly in every public work	 69.15392899824265
which in it anything of gravity contains preparation should be with	 65.97552109221985
importance commensurate and therefore a plan was by them adopted	 39.070720899960804
(whether by having preconsidered or as the maturation of experience it	 78.58611283627783
is difficult in being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent	 36.437518019266854
inquirers are not up to the present congrued to render manifest)	 32.37768636451549
whereby maternity was so far from all accident possibility removed that	 68.97290210811815
whatever care the patient in that allhardest of woman hour chiefly	 118.09045389912606
required and not solely for the copiously opulent but also for her who	 48.62033347992083
not being sufficiently moneyed scarcely and often not even scarcely	 132.16334699216344
could subsist valiantly and for an inconsiderable emolument was	 41.78664865494518
provided.	 11448.636138514892
To her nothing already then and thenceforward was anyway able to be	 75.86951593015601
molestful for this chiefly felt all citizens except with proliferent	 86.68205849968973
mothers prosperity at all not to can be and as they had received	 98.76990667898092
eternity gods mortals generation to befit them her beholding, when the	 51.60408741694491
case was so hoving itself, parturient in vehicle thereward carrying	 89.18471004423043
desire immense among all one another was impelling on of her to be	 149.62639235998478
received into that domicile. O thing of prudent nation not merely in	 117.81081623244418
being seen but also even in being related worthy of being praised that	 119.19223666143677
they her by anticipation went seeing mother, that she by them suddenly	 354.09472285787604
to be about to be cherished had been begun she felt!	 42.78313633346535
Before born bliss babe had. Within womb won he worship. Whatever in	 332.43430694907096
that one case done commodiously done was. A couch by midwives attended	 202.9293881532694
with wholesome food reposeful, cleanest swaddles as though	 38.82997224819813
forthbringing were now done and by wise foresight set: but to this no	 176.18947301024227
less of what drugs there is need and surgical implements which are	 96.3037791206929
pertaining to her case not omitting aspect of all very distracting	 44.99462655253954
spectacles in various latitudes by our terrestrial orb offered together	 105.03545953853678
with images, divine and human, the cogitation of which by sejunct	 42.86636594208545
females is to tumescence conducive or eases issue in the high sunbright	 63.52424571774574
wellbuilt fair home of mothers when, ostensibly far gone and	 188.29449113089856
reproductitive, it is come by her thereto to lie in, her term up.	 53.36781303933917
Some man that wayfaring was stood by housedoor at night’s oncoming. Of	 48.38120287739004
Israel’s folk was that man that on earth wandering far had fared. Stark	 113.90030283955168
ruth of man his errand that him lone led till that house.	 135.05352643990807
Of that house A. Horne is lord. Seventy beds keeps he there teeming	 161.21629279979388
mothers are wont that they lie for to thole and bring forth bairns hale	 57.633028572872774
so God’s angel to Mary quoth. Watchers tway there walk, white sisters	 101.98167749665917
in ward sleepless. Smarts they still, sickness soothing: in twelve	 88.83816653671065
moons thrice an hundred. Truest bedthanes they twain are, for Horne	 78.75630848962669
holding wariest ward.	 661.5497585923205
In ward wary the watcher hearing come that man mildhearted eft rising	 136.9871404534088
with swire ywimpled to him her gate wide undid. Lo, levin leaping	 61.10746288918718
lightens in eyeblink Ireland’s westward welkin. Full she drad that God	 60.98475059518301
the Wreaker all mankind would fordo with water for his evil sins.	 50.48401689530842
Christ’s rood made she on breastbone and him drew that he would rathe	 94.55428101339001
infare under her thatch. That man her will wotting worthful went in	 67.07306572083567
Horne’s house.	 189.6331878601038
Loth to irk in Horne’s hall hat holding the seeker stood. On her stow	 24.317192361455625
he ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over	 132.96975218144487
land and seafloor nine years had long outwandered. Once her in	 180.54708207685525
townhithe meeting he to her bow had not doffed. Her to forgive now he	 78.73760623578987
craved with good ground of her allowed that that of him swiftseen face,	 103.72220959041553
hers, so young then had looked. Light swift her eyes kindled, bloom of	 274.2041285298265
blushes his word winning.	 43.53487165965411
As her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared. Glad	 126.5486775805419
after she was that ere adread was. Her he asked if O’Hare Doctor	 134.3780208537968
tidings sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered	 182.12312632041295
that O’Hare Doctor in heaven was. Sad was the man that word to hear	 99.05585327847061
that him so heavied in bowels ruthful. All she there told him, ruing	 80.48339979957204
death for friend so young, algate sore unwilling God’s rightwiseness to	 170.7972603374374
withsay. She said that he had a fair sweet death through God His	 104.25236530775017
goodness with masspriest to be shriven, holy housel and sick men’s oil	 87.78414909202804
to his limbs. The man then right earnest asked the nun of which death	 100.19382256220742
the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was	 53.248226286254976
died in Mona Island through bellycrab three year agone come Childermas	 118.8185023925498
and she prayed to God the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his	 64.57081636704328
undeathliness. He heard her sad words, in held hat sad staring. So	 166.3699671171882
stood they there both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other.	 152.35749060974902
Therefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the	 110.76839685715714
dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came	 120.66175694353723
naked forth from his mother’s womb so naked shall he wend him at the	 116.89658853400348
last for to go as he came.	 119.42421312083846
The man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman	 41.829743508914305
and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in	 76.62128689236222
childbed. The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in	 51.79560272700109
throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to	 52.20257828423016
bear but that now in a little it would be. She said thereto that she	 84.60155986942145
had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that	 105.08559452911277
woman’s birth. Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew	 114.50426977440104
the man that time was had lived nigh that house. The man hearkened to	 59.45579804148314
her words for he felt with wonder women’s woe in the travail that they	 70.19181669956082
have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair	 35.81861529410545
face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a	 177.30239277299768
handmaid. Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.	 29.824727033257094
And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there	 48.94720913185957
nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat. And there	 89.27485446534429
came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept	 53.913042538505685
Dixon. And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed	 32.34096167793522
that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where	 60.54600813666293
this learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be	 96.9590744946337
healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a	 33.25326550444619
horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a	 82.49853179407508
salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice. And he	 24.571864644081767
said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with	 83.79601703451205
them that were there. And the traveller Leopold said that he should go	 46.97928164263487
otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile. Also the lady	 33.04040142013905
was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well	 35.572173032128624
that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility. But	 109.92155905204774
the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have	 98.96732281899936
him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a	 47.98771475238957
marvellous castle. And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for	 70.19389634925983
to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches	 88.18456955404925
environing in divers lands and sometime venery.	 25.127529559408316
And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy	 32.13633758691315
and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not	 46.1742793801199
move more for enchantment. And on this board were frightful swords and	 87.27544526138544
knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white	 31.518021911006723
flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there	 30.863243981238885
abound marvellously. And there were vessels that are wrought by magic	 21.48044831366369
of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that	 31.089506016846496
he blases in to them like to bubbles. And full fair cheer and rich was	 94.26051831332889
on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer. And there	 52.10731530097827
was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay	 75.43750132302029
strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be	 134.23235170507547
possible thing without they see it natheless they are so. And these	 127.64369606922384
fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of	 171.97413317981162
the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress. And	 17.936219711341593
also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a	 51.045371343363676
compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of	 19.800023712395838
certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like	 138.78624807750182
to a vast mountain. And they teach the serpents there to entwine	 78.33705211952085
themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of	 29.288148069813982
these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.	 87.33686378677847
And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp	 86.18977169788089
thereto the while all they that were there drank every each. And childe	 178.29615428908238
Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat	 132.62049983695078
in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and	 85.68034093497491
anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and	 57.26363562211439
his neighbour nist not of this wile. And he sat down in that castle	 50.518834387694845
with them for to rest him there awhile. Thanked be Almighty God.	 234.65190934142447
This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at	 106.53810214402509
the reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing	 38.03094988367335
for there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time	 186.7118936132842
hied fast. Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered	 56.783448705231855
what cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he,	 139.17177012512275
that it be not come or now. Meseems it dureth overlong. And he was ware	 59.30024623989706
and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was	 116.90994058059782
older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights	 44.908939986465214
virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke	 37.70359133931933
to him full gently. But, said he, or it be long too she will bring	 301.704770136679
forth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath	 63.35607181996406
waited marvellous long. And the franklin that had drunken said,	 147.66538796878277
Expecting each moment to be her next. Also he took the cup that stood	 83.57953204108152
tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to	 69.76701246161028
drink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far	 64.48240639691338
as he might to their both’s health for he was a passing good man of his	 84.5645823449193
lustiness. And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat	 42.51686495480976
in scholars’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that	 30.014306597514032
ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight	 92.51474915116529
of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged	 151.05639884979578
him courtly in the cup. Woman’s woe with wonder pondering.	 67.2983676720043
Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be	 33.6649531227736
drunken an they might. There was a sort of scholars along either side	 194.83238371482474
the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary	 78.81703412086203
Merciable’s with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of	 130.8466089028808
medicine, and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa,	 52.808936632473305
one Crotthers, and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at	 52.20285342430698
head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long	 136.53849707088062
of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young	 35.35323766881656
Stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and	 70.19704703590482
beside the meek sir Leopold. But on young Malachi they waited for that	 218.43029386523727
he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how	 78.11795060163415
he had broke his avow. And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast	 75.72661527766594
friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that	 144.33122417784836
his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as	 33.50872863201411
they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner. Ruth red	 48.27186868434409
him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave.	 225.98933901888765
For they were right witty scholars. And he heard their aresouns each	 66.80834781344001
gen other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining	 94.45824795478956
that put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen	 185.47815026769015
out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne’s house	 39.4207671861439
that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next	 84.83282590527263
before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her	 54.94166641872862
case). And they said farther she should live because in the beginning,	 150.8293660500939
they said, the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that	 110.9999317002696
were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for	 116.52712823213838
he had conscience to let her die. And not few and of these was young	 85.97328993231244
Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it	 94.10467346539549
was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the	 100.82779820466088
law nor his judges did provide no remedy. A redress God grant. This was	 125.38151417078036
scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother,	 144.87524082605444
the wife should live and the babe to die. In colour whereof they waxed	 63.36809010501317
hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but	 216.44658942246616
the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at	 141.60002544897287
the least way mirth might not lack. Then young Madden showed all the	 67.25033288027316
whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion	 85.56860003023336
sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint	 58.18543768319955
Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby	 52.37793613255842
they were all wondrous grieved. To whom young Stephen had these words	 82.0157890807805
following: Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk. Both babe and	 109.00729013424373
parent now glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in	 65.44113119563208
purgefire. But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we	 82.52508419146889
nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very	 62.06945140204003
God, Lord and Giver of Life? For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief. We	 80.03837641924447
are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends	 156.40119879809242
than we. Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends.	 181.4328693145061
But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was	 82.43063769110938
that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or	 44.58386844907879
leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead.	 29.34279035722488
Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi’s praise of that	 79.88629519813499
beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the	 46.55751132634907
other all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they	 107.22605110919476
did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his	 104.32631472064487
engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to	 52.00120129821914
do. Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir	 208.09491221530678
Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour	 146.96896339237318
which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare	 53.97022761068663
whoso she might be or wheresoever. Then spake young Stephen orgulous of	 42.522129525964644
mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons,	 58.596082878021036
of Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of	 23.84894309574496
brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius	 129.28462144334173
saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or	 36.710438150057705
an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, _effectu	 174.7404458276798
secuto_, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of	 15.427487091262192
Averroes and Moses Maimonides. He said also how at the end of the	 36.20590501604036
second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother	 79.59134460373042
foldeth ever souls for God’s greater glory whereas that earthly mother	 113.1804321563121
which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he	 171.50329585161833
that holdeth the fisherman’s seal, even that blessed Peter on which	 95.20511180037403
rock was holy church for all ages founded. All they bachelors then	 119.34019714855395
asked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as	 123.77406226055501
risk life to save life. A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted	 82.08303668486234
all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his wont was, that	 90.86288225093625
as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a	 54.46665857260183
layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an	 59.955810013550476
accident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had	 119.35799299560455
birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their	 90.15171727731881
questions. That is truth, pardy, said Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant	 110.5328102866548
word. Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he	 94.4790590058398
averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he	 36.97458827081053
was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that	 58.114515838305564
taking it appeared eftsoons.	 114.87504002703906
But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had	 140.08552174157882
pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and	 37.392364225482936
as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only	 61.7347541563268
manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art	 112.82045349206705
could save so dark is destiny. And she was wondrous stricken of heart	 114.20454648640724
for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of	 54.84353231615642
lamb’s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and	 45.530394824980235
lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now sir	 54.29903926423135
Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him	 70.35251037351722
his friend’s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness	 82.856022406953
and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for	 46.80077895878428
all accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure	 130.9216009920294
for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and	 60.22151067817397
murdered his goods with whores.	 439.10102693039306
About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty	 122.22360799376004
so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed	 87.63363694668708
their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying	 102.4721177309796
for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge	 23.540129634251382
the vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray. Now drink	 43.52085730439987
we, quod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed	 82.19782462874039
parcel of my body but my soul’s bodiment. Leave ye fraction of bread to	 42.12149195827821
them that live by bread alone. Be not afeard neither for any want for	 203.64247426401556
this will comfort more than the other will dismay. See ye here. And he	 68.64814727786113
showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the	 107.29348923594203
worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song	 94.47770229825821
which he writ. They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such	 54.903897954523416
dearth of money as was herebefore. His words were then these as	 126.28878111444766
followeth: Know all men, he said, time’s ruins build eternity’s	 34.39175270214052
mansions. What means this? Desire’s wind blasts the thorntree but after	 74.07316422669884
it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time. Mark	 61.941759266974586
me now. In woman’s womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the	 118.15853109775962
maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away.	 84.19455436692454
This is the postcreation. _Omnis caro ad te veniet_. No question but	 25.889626103588544
her name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer,	 35.206132545227064
Healer and Herd, our mighty mother and mother most venerable and	 32.37651661931571
Bernardus saith aptly that She hath an _omnipotentiam deiparae	 38.25485360367622
supplicem_, that is to wit, an almightiness of petition because she is	 31.362646222104228
the second Eve and she won us, saith Augustine too, whereas that other,	 73.9203844601849
our grandam, which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of	 37.150784463669254
navelcords sold us all, seed, breed and generation, for a penny pippin.	 25.986627924245127
But here is the matter now. Or she knew him, that second I say, and was	 129.90786867661706
but creature of her creature, _vergine madre, figlia di tuo figlio_, or	 43.303407624754534
she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy	 85.77918173717319
with Peter Piscator who lives in the house that Jack built and with	 75.83641437348753
Joseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages,	 29.303287058482482
_parceque M. Léo Taxil nous a dit que qui l’avait mise dans cette	 12.977640951312214
fichue position c’était le sacré pigeon, ventre de Dieu! Entweder_	 32.00509365284363
transubstantiality _oder_ consubstantiality but in no case	 43.07852791053877
subsubstantiality. And all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word. A	 75.32024717662601
pregnancy without joy, he said, a birth without pangs, a body without	 94.47559144353237
blemish, a belly without bigness. Let the lewd with faith and fervour	 43.619237471468054
worship. With will will we withstand, withsay.	 192.93992851442826
Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would	 47.66368481232061
sing a bawdy catch _Staboo Stabella_ about a wench that was put in pod	 49.63667721261561
of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack:	 42.56366690626399
_The first three months she was not well, Staboo,_ when here nurse	 131.10867119232006
Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was	 69.6945267722863
it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all	 158.86439151041833
orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no	 91.93321367326912
gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard. It was an	 44.636897325171006
ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in	 83.88513140757442
habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her	 77.08993405803746
hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of	 60.559511283826616
them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness	 26.14570666144878
some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all	 48.44016577356825
chode with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at,	 35.998431630310236
thou chuff, thou puny, thou got in peasestraw, thou losel, thou	 89.23314650318466
chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou,	 36.88662907906987
to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the	 55.06718761157081
good sir Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet,	 70.40687527173019
margerain gentle, advising also the time’s occasion as most sacred and	 81.19968435623909
most worthy to be most sacred. In Horne’s house rest should reign.	 73.0785601159766
To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in	 176.27181146080608
Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he	 141.814070662136
had not cided to take friar’s vows and he answered him obedience in the	 37.11473434496787
womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days. Master	 64.11435833765742
Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds	 69.00146987246002
and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue	 57.24711461408296
of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all	 28.622996319167115
intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership. But he	 46.63442691082773
said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was	 129.52877743658092
the eternal son and ever virgin. Thereat mirth grew in them the more	 192.62160854983816
and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing	 25.150821061467862
and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island,	 52.20921933988235
she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain,	 33.24643344958345
with burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries	 19.83087293223058
and the anthem _Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was	 19.02404143978065
there unmaided. He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those	 66.84658754897946
delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is	 120.64363464376481
in their _Maid’s Tragedy_ that was writ for a like twining of lovers:	 64.44452577115868
_To bed, to bed_ was the burden of it to be played with accompanable	 58.236725943573745
concent upon the virginals. An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most	 36.46075098623055
mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous	 14.866555546425587
flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium	 11.623108881798641
of connubial communion. Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed,	 96.68015400633097
but, harkee, young sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher	 100.70583808288569
for, by my troth, of such a mingling much might come. Young Stephen	 158.5960510052877
said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between	 108.0015285428874
them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for	 70.75683518660044
life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved	 60.68891379181946
with it. Greater love than this, he said, no man hath that a man lay	 113.72826265705196
down his wife for his friend. Go thou and do likewise. Thus, or words	 118.23835123159778
to that effect, saith Zarathustra, sometime regius professor of French	 100.27362573768501
letters to the university of Oxtail nor breathed there ever that man to	 105.39104010275396
whom mankind was more beholden. Bring a stranger within thy tower it	 207.1520567239667
will go hard but thou wilt have the secondbest bed. _Orate, fratres,	 111.5481924909927
pro memetipso_. And all the people shall say, Amen. Remember, Erin, thy	 99.32867685729742
generations and thy days of old, how thou settedst little by me and by	 163.8117201638413
my word and broughtedst in a stranger to my gates to commit fornication	 52.00359455666289
in my sight and to wax fat and kick like Jeshurum. Therefore hast thou	 186.40920018086703
sinned against my light and hast made me, thy lord, to be the slave of	 62.49272379850335
servants. Return, return, Clan Milly: forget me not, O Milesian. Why	 256.35708687769744
hast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for	 108.69043439873406
a merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to the Roman and to the Indian	 33.29540033367077
of dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously? Look forth	 152.88211489096125
now, my people, upon the land of behest, even from Horeb and from Nebo	 71.39988805594099
and from Pisgah and from the Horns of Hatten unto a land flowing with	 43.96163073493624
milk and money. But thou hast suckled me with a bitter milk: my moon	 103.41631717147511
and my sun thou hast quenched for ever. And thou hast left me alone for	 60.845308397124214
ever in the dark ways of my bitterness: and with a kiss of ashes hast	 62.07940977245253
thou kissed my mouth. This tenebrosity of the interior, he proceeded to	 52.59170418372177
say, hath not been illumined by the wit of the septuagint nor so much	 49.21954155998509
as mentioned for the Orient from on high which brake hell’s gates	 222.58849108239136
visited a darkness that was foraneous. Assuefaction minorates	 19.800633280481055
atrocities (as Tully saith of his darling Stoics) and Hamlet his father	 74.08852546629521
showeth the prince no blister of combustion. The adiaphane in the noon	 31.882625478126062
of life is an Egypt’s plague which in the nights of prenativity and	 40.38871806159949
postmortemity is their most proper _ubi_ and _quomodo_. And as the ends	 47.48204542631284
and ultimates of all things accord in some mean and measure with their	 49.26200658749263
inceptions and originals, that same multiplicit concordance which leads	 24.090836181781484
forth growth from birth accomplishing by a retrogressive metamorphosis	 44.976653158087345
that minishing and ablation towards the final which is agreeable unto	 24.731858522920465
nature so is it with our subsolar being. The aged sisters draw us into	 177.5536768647247
life: we wail, batten, sport, clip, clasp, sunder, dwindle, die: over	 107.28389411700282
us dead they bend. First, saved from waters of old Nile, among	 120.98591774566007
bulrushes, a bed of fasciated wattles: at last the cavity of a	 21.892700621027352
mountain, an occulted sepulchre amid the conclamation of the hillcat	 24.72861440366107
and the ossifrage. And as no man knows the ubicity of his tumulus nor	 36.071831271257025
to what processes we shall thereby be ushered nor whether to Tophet or	 78.72919343036693
to Edenville in the like way is all hidden when we would backward see	 94.06961460269706
from what region of remoteness the whatness of our whoness hath fetched	 46.876567972353776
his whenceness.	 21.605641423575047
Thereto Punch Costello roared out mainly _Etienne chanson_ but he	 23.706055171296722
loudly bid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast	 176.41054637024817
majestic longstablished vault, the crystal palace of the Creator, all	 20.58604415230683
in applepie order, a penny for him who finds the pea.	 42.45818234691138
Behold the mansion reared by dedal Jack	 57.45505961996838
See the malt stored in many a refluent sack,	 55.73799822773179
In the proud cirque of Jackjohn’s bivouac.	 14.530793213655192
A black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled back. Loud on	 74.1911545763513
left Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler. Came now the	 62.48016882323098
storm that hist his heart. And Master Lynch bade him have a care to	 103.96253025632957
flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and	 23.226699739446047
paganry. And he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as	 26.586708048948697
they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before	 66.49863124788415
so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart	 90.14065303712329
shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that	 27.826078861585408
storm. Then did some mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard	 191.04874770655712
again to his yale which Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he	 91.01780049041218
was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour. But the	 96.88895537934363
braggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy was in his cups it was	 39.55983315074097
muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead. But this was	 37.20757581205875
only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne’s hall. He	 34.326847480180646
drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it	 140.93058750724921
thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden,	 107.24203896025533
being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of	 156.54028660534766
doom and Master Bloom, at the braggart’s side, spoke to him calming	 43.59049944660793
words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was no other thing	 98.45646598533439
but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from the	 36.65135500497651
thunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of a	 71.69847774495257
natural phenomenon.	 995.694033684496
But was young Boasthard’s fear vanquished by Calmer’s words? No, for he	 149.15592516702023
had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be	 99.65274174002009
done away. And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the	 129.54647594252262
other? He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either. But	 54.58888906855724
could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the	 113.89046042174995
bottle Holiness that then he lived withal? Indeed no for Grace was not	 146.63344987190038
there to find that bottle. Heard he then in that clap the voice of the	 85.19172958378903
god Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon? Heard?	 80.26481610422253
Why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube	 51.577424202919694
Understanding (which he had not done). For through that tube he saw	 85.08299609830614
that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one	 46.02393597938625
day die as he was like the rest too a passing show. And would he not	 75.18013672492941
accept to die like the rest and pass away? By no means would he though	 159.03742980056117
he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives	 206.04795384839738
which Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law. Then wotted	 99.92852333362873
he nought of that other land which is called Believe-on-Me, that is the	 96.98975561708828
land of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for	 54.70859791318552
ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering	 128.8399403198565
at which all shall come as many as believe on it? Yes, Pious had told	 149.94034028760154
him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason	 68.08679586677914
was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing	 34.956880293889206
exterior whose name, she said, is Bird-in-the-Hand and she beguiled him	 44.28840148773998
wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as,	 39.32399931217404
Ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and I will show you a brave	 109.00930364507903
place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot	 53.69830899801266
which is named Two-in-the-Bush or, by some learned, Carnal	 75.18106715532366
Concupiscence.	 4.608171674364364
This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of	 96.265049632512
Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore	 193.36639862988426
Bird-in-the-Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a	 36.029793144724664
wicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and	 101.44049070100131
know her. For regarding Believe-on-Me they said it was nought else but	 47.87618266803788
notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first,	 49.89591335828747
Two-in-the-Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and	 23.61924782748672
in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words	 85.38852127298566
printed on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by	 37.47042136991509
Jowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they	 45.08840003027019
cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of	 53.014157407314144
oxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring	 78.24716712284973
that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was	 54.78238976119657
named Killchild. So were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr	 101.74581061471258
Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon,	 156.260627164959
Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer. Wherein, O wretched company,	 100.47281026911689
were ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a	 38.457920491785664
very grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and spill	 41.399213052973046
their souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them	 61.33993849546295
contrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth.	 54.56948782250846
So Thursday sixteenth June Patk. Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and	 90.20554523650972
after hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a	 160.63930546179523
fifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won’t sprout, fields	 245.98243352673614
athirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too.	 17.491795527259594
Hard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without	 112.45014080113411
sprinkle this long while back as no man remembered to be without. The	 147.15035286617908
rosy buds all gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought	 73.44235616110507
but dry flag and faggots that would catch at first fire. All the world	 116.63382281566193
saying, for aught they knew, the big wind of last February a year that	 110.70818734085839
did havoc the land so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness.	 87.77315687875043
But by and by, as said, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in	 238.0021454171648
the west, biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and	 68.31349479725077
the weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first	 39.994259009355254
and after, past ten of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder	 112.43982310067037
and in a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the	 41.31844705443402
smoking shower, the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or	 80.66164729057371
kerchief, womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the	 44.28813273692435
pour came. In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke’s lawn, thence through	 152.57572028941925
Merrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was	 93.32844852883115
before bonedry and not one chair or coach or fiacre seen about but no	 137.33952502704417
more crack after that first. Over against the Rt. Hon. Mr Justice	 102.8254910982166
Fitzgibbon’s door (that is to sit with Mr Healy the lawyer upon the	 44.2913528527356
college lands) Mal. Mulligan a gentleman’s gentleman that had but come	 128.87153253670147
from Mr Moore’s the writer’s (that was a papish but is now, folk say, a	 52.76116735143715
good Williamite) chanced against Alec. Bannon in a cut bob (which are	 148.69537833659965
now in with dance cloaks of Kendal green) that was new got to town from	 167.9475328145454
Mullingar with the stage where his coz and Mal M’s brother will stay a	 65.6716439047489
month yet till Saint Swithin and asks what in the earth he does there,	 121.48690400534747
he bound home and he to Andrew Horne’s being stayed for to crush a cup	 93.3087508148855
of wine, so he said, but would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of	 84.93969307969161
her age and beef to the heel, and all this while poured with rain and	 92.47634621579674
so both together on to Horne’s. There Leop. Bloom of Crawford’s journal	 243.84132856252072
sitting snug with a covey of wags, likely brangling fellows, Dixon	 85.22254464288716
jun., scholar of my lady of Mercy’s, Vin. Lynch, a Scots fellow, Will.	 39.92317375606699
Madden, T. Lenehan, very sad about a racer he fancied and Stephen D.	 117.47386381070656
Leop. Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better, he having	 114.59348686182847
dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers	 68.34693963271037
on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be	 48.739802301249334
for a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading	 160.12646159939894
her belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her term,	 53.54508979358785
the midwives sore put to it and can’t deliver, she queasy for a bowl of	 53.671369585536716
riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very	 24.742001175042063
heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they	 74.63268976984394
say, but God give her soon issue. ’Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear,	 93.90320374134427
and Lady day bit off her last chick’s nails that was then a twelvemonth	 74.01273820618155
and with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand	 82.23862049917518
in the king’s bible. Her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the	 65.66427300419969
sacrament and is to be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys	 73.83576687124392
off Bullock harbour dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in	 54.68587534973175
a punt he has trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag,	 32.26342399863224
I hear. In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and	 112.20947989973892
will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and	 173.51134791440654
water fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi’s almanac (and I	 51.35074550936055
hear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out	 76.57409815744904
of the Hindustanish for his farmer’s gazette) to have three things in	 52.46112061935784
all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and	 78.48376063317079
bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their	 43.70325642133243
queerities no telling how.	 258.79382516452165
With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the	 93.4435462206099
letter was in that night’s gazette and he made a show to find it about	 109.6842654022343
him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but	 50.05799671272069
on Stephen’s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit	 88.55397752350748
near by which he did mighty brisk. He was a kind of sport gentleman	 72.75662186447629
that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of	 42.12324787692406
women, horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat. To tell the truth he	 90.92906760206773
was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the	 75.1025128488525
coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul’s men,	 20.38439921636355
runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues	 15.960029924843926
of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at	 56.19103606818538
nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much	 222.84021276570388
loose gossip. He took his ordinary at a boilingcook’s and if he had but	 67.81324489949598
gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a	 25.924640745820522
bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his	 108.94045149170145
tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every	 48.47386433007338
mother’s son of them would burst their sides. The other, Costello that	 96.27205169567253
is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale. Faith, no, he	 191.08376513967028
says, Frank (that was his name), ’tis all about Kerry cows that are to	 113.90409791205126
be butchered along of the plague. But they can go hang, says he with a	 86.20575300020181
wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it. There’s as good fish	 69.64692545503524
in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take	 78.22933038029201
of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the	 31.368212901025753
meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his	 42.37456843540472
embassy as he was sharpset. _Mort aux vaches_, says Frank then in the	 19.023206976888737
French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a	 50.44461651854898
winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too. From a	 61.97640144472397
child this Frank had been a donought that his father, a headborough,	 67.16458816138162
who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of	 72.16731740415025
the globes, matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but	 34.3907520638485
he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar	 62.70705090043184
with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes. One	 25.275774558708317
time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought	 37.53605390887022
would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for	 39.17743897746926
the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk,	 48.2646166927263
kidnapping a squire’s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids’	 44.44199715534328
linen or choking chicken behind a hedge. He had been off as many times	 55.3699932073635
as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to	 174.1599295057474
his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw	 68.6716528735324
him. What, says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to	 100.29003786428932
know the drift of it, will they slaughter all? I protest I saw them but	 54.90419672814523
this day morning going to the Liverpool boats, says he. I can scarce	 46.43002685989999
believe ’tis so bad, says he. And he had experience of the like brood	 47.646009006564654
beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been	 94.15250850188795
some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster	 116.74310941544883
that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr	 109.16221642247625
Gavin Low’s yard in Prussia street. I question with you there, says he.	 69.10788299202625
More like ’tis the hoose or the timber tongue. Mr Stephen, a little	 109.63070616853281
moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had	 106.74137961942175
dispatches from the emperor’s chief tailtickler thanking him for the	 19.71135736086329
hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted	 39.72762851996181
cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the	 21.721910765985218
bull by the horns. Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing. He’ll	 101.58449325139856
find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that’s	 67.9087541650215
Irish, says he. Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr Stephen, and	 283.5758470229196
he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English chinashop. I	 129.89671314531404
conceive you, says Mr Dixon. It is that same bull that was sent to our	 55.0859046008505
island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with	 33.46102161680719
an emerald ring in his nose. True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the	 50.631250117701015
table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a	 45.17368462859653
portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock. He had horns galore, a	 46.71184117740606
coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his	 57.72682273812856
nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and	 56.968138267895725
rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains.	 60.67423066879191
What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas	 58.79068413040598
that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who	 93.79244821205644
were no better off than himself. So be off now, says he, and do all my	 162.7948710065848
cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer’s blessing,	 72.0895164296502
and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly. But the slap and	 43.328125094103434
the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he	 140.0079608459156
taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess	 93.48707643614433
and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the	 63.39637860400915
month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the	 65.04075024952225
nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young	 78.36897414193555
ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland. Another then put in his	 57.830600698235735
word: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat	 84.27790563403703
with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his	 11.020983728606632
forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables	 54.60247997992149
for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of	 101.91519101527193
the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his	 35.45003676202844
heart’s content. By this time the father of the faithful (for so they	 51.75101851057227
called him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture. To	 72.60906872109034
remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in	 70.18258042559758
their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on	 67.92641310154195
his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow	 42.32359165127789
out of him in bulls’ language and they all after him. Ay, says another,	 88.8104244022687
and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the	 55.155188845722506
land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his	 83.93819022237166
mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the	 31.041926224429762
island with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the	 120.04568779137679
grass that grows on the ground. And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got	 70.12276687460246
scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a	 19.770032248057124
husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or	 23.467007444028816
a bag of rapeseed out he’d run amok over half the countryside rooting	 58.36364090900488
up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry’s orders.	 124.46138250024258
There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the	 48.15039896871435
lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an	 43.15675810421839
old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I’ll meddle in	 58.717558955455424
his matters, says he. I’ll make that animal smell hell, says he, with	 57.33464852289397
the help of that good pizzle my father left me. But one evening, says	 84.40528027613618
Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to	 57.04371843098957
dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the	 42.499590842444526
first rule of the course was that the others were to row with	 90.01401432278398
pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and	 50.47599300679313
on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he	 36.99363777127756
found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous	 42.98204387144028
champion bull of the Romans, _Bos Bovum_, which is good bog Latin for	 42.79682325959371
boss of the show. After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his	 59.035803091332824
head into a cow’s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers	 26.86302239259006
and pulling it out again told them all his new name. Then, with the	 85.81226395811849
water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had	 81.517768500412
belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls’ language	 21.969351253404028
to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first	 65.31882828122393
personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if	 95.08111596197693
ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write	 72.92614197605486
it upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or	 147.93245340541552
a bale of cotton or a corkfloat. In short, he and the bull of Ireland	 33.76231410935126
were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt. They were, says Mr	 133.760227868247
Stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was	 101.81488763021898
toward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft,	 44.82436644297474
loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all	 49.393787519718686
masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread	 48.95436538297643
three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed	 72.22606225376079
anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times	 65.77608349049618
three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea	 182.06013745673548
to recover the main of America. Which was the occasion, says Mr	 76.93025840199208
Vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty:	 31.234667007693492
_—Pope Peter’s but a pissabed.	 12.99502959932421
A man’s a man for a’ that._	 79.38940582081848
Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway	 40.46807447695286
as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend	 50.2866640017493
whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon,	 88.2097895912025
who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a	 70.30416771058539
cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars. Mr Mulligan was civil	 35.971251927506444
enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a	 61.96236080923376
project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched	 89.34129633105908
on. Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards	 44.36693914567736
which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell’s bearing a legend	 91.72774002412444
printed in fair italics: _Mr Malachi Mulligan. Fertiliser and	 51.009168634526226
Incubator. Lambay Island_. His project, as he went on to expound, was	 34.98092499317653
to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief	 100.88433984143998
business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and	 59.84361732090252
to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has	 27.36970287372002
been framed. Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon. I	 80.26766248258458
make no doubt it smacks of wenching. Come, be seated, both. ’Tis as	 165.1633711834511
cheap sitting as standing. Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and,	 65.52050623432972
expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into	 35.24159694507207
this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the	 60.972509275787196
inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were	 41.53683664722848
due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as	 32.65504460522272
whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from	 34.91213884702343
proclivities acquired. It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the	 20.581127280753254
nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so	 69.31324840611838
many agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest	 63.466810136436116
bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial	 30.44221342377944
cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some	 52.02327496697825
unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness,	 21.842327696179396
sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty	 46.22706197928539
fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart	 107.39975277503318
weep. To curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a	 43.93063596214108
suppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of	 43.4390714913298
worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in	 92.04869951743139
fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord	 50.530554921721986
Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our	 162.30819844046104
ascendancy party. He proposed to set up there a national fertilising	 71.4085411894808
farm to be named _Omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the	 33.205058905034804
fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the	 56.417920217791384
fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there	 67.16378492282196
direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her	 19.989445975829653
natural. Money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for	 81.25520380524245
his pains. The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of	 92.75462305446278
fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm	 118.28810741930948
persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man. For his	 88.42946151837361
nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet	 47.24464849563714
of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these	 44.597091142060954
latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both	 31.401619473036174
broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum	 13.602610646415735
chillies. After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of	 38.12020563320326
asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief	 63.6934053242314
with which he had shielded it. They both, it seems, had been overtaken	 61.466186769879585
by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as	 93.4279754001743
might be observed by Mr Mulligan’s smallclothes of a hodden grey which	 44.676619589171125
was now somewhat piebald. His project meanwhile was very favourably	 73.88227470085783
entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr	 46.46783603821632
Dixon of Mary’s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he	 82.99436451713113
purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle. Mr Mulligan however made	 169.37190103892726
court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as	 33.534063022965015
it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of	 40.18501499950989
his contention: _Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut	 17.593334705760547
matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici	 3.857285642109819
titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus	 3.857285642109819
centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt_, while for those of ruder	 26.087617388220533
wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more	 156.5169419169971
suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the	 42.17875399868428
farmyard drake and duck.	 29.38772608903704
Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper	 135.6166609156966
man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with	 106.24891991385272
animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics	 28.95139274376537
while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had	 85.6377676374244
advanced. The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a	 63.88724454946603
passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his	 102.23943277500638
nearest neighbour. Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for	 120.58918352540553
whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him	 85.07427925129446
a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional	 123.20305391535771
assistance we could give? Who, upon his offer, thanked him very	 128.75184316449045
heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he	 179.59793942042774
was come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne’s house, that was	 89.28595607336351
in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman’s woe (and here he	 145.52725299237457
fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place. Mr	 123.30503336178067
Dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether	 236.74913652416222
his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an	 32.789158190528205
ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due,	 24.59843036029485
as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the	 22.86705947837505
stomach. For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls,	 73.15645411989993
smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable	 25.07904903855913
droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex	 34.71340046817562
though ’tis pity she’s a trollop): There’s a belly that never bore a	 117.54862325178422
bastard. This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth	 100.71673431925561
and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight.	 47.46326046658241
The spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some	 50.41973234409541
larum in the antechamber.	 6.2586885757549
Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little	 117.92496567971241
fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion	 32.09309371051768
with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient	 24.641890669479025
point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the	 38.59144316106781
obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by	 35.79992910774131
a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had	 25.635378188161727
not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but	 134.41065089720686
contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was	 67.47352516811436
ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it. _Mais bien	 34.11864644451517
sûr_, noble stranger, said he cheerily, _et mille compliments_. That	 72.37120050856316
you may and very opportunely. There wanted nothing but this cup to	 175.52868837765627
crown my felicity. But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in	 108.93918073635925
my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept	 57.65317642420544
of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give	 49.37751406665803
thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver	 64.3199280776781
of good things. With these words he approached the goblet to his lips,	 70.71595349947633
took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening	 59.093503206298394
his bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very	 96.97648578562136
picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein.	 90.2835431726658
Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he	 121.68126517007413
said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting	 152.18594484752632
instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her	 68.38219902546403
feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so	 30.438438465232373
melting a tenderness, ’pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been	 157.64968136283065
impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands	 70.85970673098383
of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever. I declare, I was never	 65.57304273242993
so touched in all my life. God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days!	 76.06257098907821
Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her	 136.10318111290573
favours. A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having	 72.64656889729655
replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again.	 34.32678688425839
Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great	 51.52835203232832
and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in	 72.4740805562781
thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished	 41.454929674826346
coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of	 34.41606897813466
maturer years. But indeed, sir, I wander from the point. How mingled	 172.48682763644672
and imperfect are all our sublunary joys. Maledicity! he exclaimed in	 24.992683388213507
anguish. Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my	 64.56235892149522
cloak along! I could weep to think of it. Then, though it had poured	 93.12306031922238
seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse. But beshrew me,	 125.1146956778438
he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day	 35.15378385579815
and, thousand thunders, I know of a _marchand de capotes_, Monsieur	 83.03024728525385
Poyntz, from whom I can have for a _livre_ as snug a cloak of the	 44.65079654340487
French fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting. Tut, tut! cries Le	 78.67637704752036
Fécondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most	 26.077313580128955
accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle _avec lui_ in	 35.28742153701353
a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape	 46.870829429752554
Horn, _ventre biche_, they have a rain that will wet through any, even	 153.70025518023442
the stoutest cloak. A drenching of that violence, he tells me, _sans	 22.117946544518155
blague_, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest	 97.87834335537129
posthaste to another world. Pooh! A _livre!_ cries Monsieur Lynch. The	 75.66336209932095
clumsy things are dear at a sou. One umbrella, were it no bigger than a	 111.39675295122309
fairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps. No woman of any wit would	 115.61360751637895
wear one. My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge	 81.22617812665419
before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she	 56.97698534117743
reminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there	 69.14576171150117
was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies), dame Nature, by the	 122.66217646088464
divine blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a	 68.34806605731698
household word that _il y a deux choses_ for which the innocence of our	 64.81367065668181
original garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is	 64.32385193421807
the fittest, nay, the only garment. The first, said she (and here my	 103.56901028240725
pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my	 73.18273883675346
attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear),	 163.0434648335793
the first is a bath... But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall	 94.42117255899815
cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of	 75.4778148794471
our store of knowledge.	 79.6888817680545
Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while	 47.44731134872612
all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and,	 80.03409490022709
having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with	 91.55714189914875
a profound bow to the company. The presence even for a moment among a	 61.520660296339784
party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and	 29.413466255490516
not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of	 55.62273714004547
the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of	 39.916664131518104
ribaldry. Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled.	 69.95562047362203
A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I’ll be sworn she has rendezvoused	 51.9061262310882
you. What, you dog? Have you a way with them? Gad’s bud, immensely so,	 62.66360568748366
said Mr Lynch. The bedside manner it is that they use in the Mater	 80.96384812966092
hospice. Demme, does not Doctor O’Gargle chuck the nuns there under the	 61.16949968611868
chin. As I look to be saved I had it from my Kitty who has been	 100.03364700923858
wardmaid there any time these seven months. Lawksamercy, doctor, cried	 121.45752734519016
the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and	 25.176061434979637
with immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the	 43.618891345786196
man! Bless me, I’m all of a wibbly wobbly. Why, you’re as bad as dear	 50.54818888432711
little Father Cantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half	 149.1995228991592
choke me, cried Costello, if she aint in the family way. I knows a lady	 103.79614395344089
what’s got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her. The young	 116.12587861152174
surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as	 119.6406144224279
the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward.	 68.85484456526906
Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings	 66.61271617928486
of the lady who was _enceinte_ which she had borne with a laudable	 24.031071457344435
fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy. I want patience,	 43.69529336844216
said he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to	 94.54010689808521
instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence	 30.58953619138281
due to the Deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth. I	 76.59499413759227
am positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of	 77.05778807971264
witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far	 27.587345542329956
from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human	 43.34591091150893
breast. I cannot away with them. What? Malign such an one, the amiable	 198.62882859979993
Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of	 22.933345149612062
ours? And at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child	 66.08578000536586
of clay? Perish the thought! I shudder to think of the future of a race	 50.324420189179506
where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right	 81.50465288027416
reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne. Having	 221.22610098151432
delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and	 171.43327729733147
repaired to the door. A murmur of approval arose from all and some were	 44.70276929244884
for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have	 80.177037839737
been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had	 94.98742048117616
he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid	 38.269206496138196
imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of	 52.34299913139978
the true fold as ever drew breath. Stap my vitals, said he, them was	 167.8263024957834
always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most	 56.699279114206405
particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand	 119.54353667730598
to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks	 50.60724587017257
back on with a loving heart.	 122.57250809554236
To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of	 60.88497464224103
some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits	 97.81005003115904
of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity.	 69.66263012224312
The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as	 69.08237581026847
overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were	 42.946365819049824
difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and	 104.54761391246036
outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were	 84.29812080262468
they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of	 23.506420101251756
strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf. But the word of Mr	 97.2746704928363
Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch	 89.56608337506566
that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born	 43.79635876890104
out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into	 65.73305680401248
the world, which the dint of the surgeon’s pliers in his skull lent	 17.952162959415517
indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of	 85.32980182841841
creation’s chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin. It was	 45.72161850113998
now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had	 58.38344395861092
passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a	 123.14143764109096
wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his	 31.12736341643714
heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting	 45.99372779018636
them with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that	 32.463797566674295
plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn	 32.7522861392078
and all find tolerable and but tolerable. To those who create	 65.6683776733901
themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which	 58.15846994369955
he never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the	 131.94273794893053
name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such	 63.98360632682505
that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the	 93.72972619429682
sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a	 118.69841509778708
precipitate and inglorious retreat. Not but what he could feel with	 49.8782741190553
mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the	 35.92853394151798
gruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy	 25.130100547202325
Writer expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far	 82.52363481287635
forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a	 68.972513979809
gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions. To conclude, while	 30.532876107481048
from the sister’s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was,	 24.893405397724933
however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence	 39.30154766907973
that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now	 67.97295914624799
testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the	 24.206374633050437
Supreme Being.	 128.2296384386798
Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express	 68.18594231767058
his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to	 86.63200312642292
express one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid	 53.57271190569871
genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her	 45.008416117651564
confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers.	 102.02652202592601
The dressy young blade said it was her husband’s that put her in that	 62.71775535487261
expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian	 60.629045277083556
matron. I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table	 54.860004682336225
so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum	 27.71923730060124
was round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring	 99.79350622884232
through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he	 95.51958747754814
calls her. I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event	 66.51529016875472
would burst anon. ’Slife, I’ll be round with you. I cannot but extol	 79.46839360544728
the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another	 44.9407047507149
child out of her. All fell to praising of it, each after his own	 110.1499471760171
fashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that	 125.64574896613722
another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in	 77.16550950684451
orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed	 126.65011717372951
in every household. Singular, communed the guest with himself, the	 62.72248583559579
wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that	 23.63821180083366
the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the	 20.795760990359213
seminaries of such frivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic	 23.048723743550042
titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of	 29.593293520994894
levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise	 69.92430443802769
eminent have esteemed the noblest. But, he further added, it is mayhap	 55.31241440497103
to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have	 88.60171463277011
more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together.	 76.58282060234298
But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron,	 158.380613209213
has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted	 56.31140428314946
to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal	 50.4734077176679
polity? Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have	 51.01577105554861
counselled? During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary	 86.05151367348195
advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that	 53.46709567204768
moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a	 53.34500674969085
tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per	 53.03503773041087
cents? Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received? Or is	 98.8125607347546
it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own	 76.5434399698558
dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer?	 58.22756273858619
Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady,	 51.23415637686634
the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant	 66.41335763759578
reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it	 72.75375711358741
was indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so. Unhappy	 120.76457417522083
woman, she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate	 70.33245191277466
prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than	 54.34492316262109
the derision of the desperate. He says this, a censor of morals, a very	 28.217531125555773
pelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of	 14.781714263453653
nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn	 33.47357957107688
from the lowest strata of society! Nay, had the hussy’s scouringbrush	 38.55554805697597
not been her tutelary angel, it had gone with her as hard as with	 107.07701939894031
Hagar, the Egyptian! In the question of the grazing lands his peevish	 33.97192986910287
asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe’s hearing brought upon him from	 64.26178483294512
an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as	 23.194830382138623
straightforward as they were bucolic. It ill becomes him to preach that	 26.18387012179372
gospel. Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the	 56.88021703875629
want of the ploughshare? A habit reprehensible at puberty is second	 76.94844852772384
nature and an opprobrium in middle life. If he must dispense his balm	 65.3019031640467
of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to	 21.606303180778706
health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist	 36.54465958208827
better with the doctrines that now engross him. His marital breast is	 84.68802399501946
the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce. The	 21.911264000355114
lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort	 29.864516514682112
neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of	 19.381530660851656
ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native	 103.85617672510826
orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but,	 37.45994360442902
transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their	 48.911277797888516
quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant,	 64.4293729543248
acid and inoperative.	 78.47177457053351
The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial	 17.166344657119687
usage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the	 12.61866393388073
junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the	 149.50712667262897
delegation that an heir had been born. When he had betaken himself to	 75.98718316601939
the women’s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the	 8.67050238721001
afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic	 12.397944198393619
affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous	 35.626429577214616
exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and	 14.13883455588053
solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would	 32.39170847194729
palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and	 23.33726238809235
obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of	 39.97480316940977
tongues. In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring	 115.71838545604035
to urge, to mollify, to refrain. The moment was too propitious for the	 28.717765446957532
display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union	 47.23757813724325
among tempers so divergent. Every phase of the situation was	 45.72095531371563
successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers,	 12.790962478499482
the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that	 20.09510254441823
rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as	 56.7206785815685
the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr	 26.498697059637784
Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused,	 29.547119690892988
the rights of primogeniture and king’s bounty touching twins and	 63.66576417099083
triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the	 9.478188664421216
acardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the	 16.02782856501344
agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan)	 26.67922225792867
in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the	 13.473551450588745
medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other	 72.30333687158056
spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation	 34.494999622503435
of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the	 48.580456576321986
vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in	 15.271919375674624
the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix,	 27.11246808882464
artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb	 19.92775799385386
consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the	 11.550754538194965
species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that	 26.564468534334495
distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers	 27.490047328672127
_Sturzgeburt,_ the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and	 6.234770745173986
monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of	 36.18568571517231
consanguineous parents—in a word all the cases of human nativity which	 44.16774835711798
Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic	 18.67846017584438
illustrations. The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine	 5.836859293226711
were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the	 46.48519475189495
state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step	 57.83764311288441
over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should	 61.71241029091373
strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a	 25.17991185724983
yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand	 25.22515107177348
against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the	 80.60870904172965
seat of castigation. The abnormalities of harelip, breastmole,	 10.967295570426476
supernumerary digits, negro’s inkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain	 32.33742660065293
were alleged by one as a _prima facie_ and natural hypothetical	 42.4033365069492
explanation of those swineheaded (the case of Madame Grissel Steevens	 23.0364617587472
was not forgotten) or doghaired infants occasionally born. The	 55.26399106398586
hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and	 13.614608814195394
worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for,	 28.507353443687485
envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some	 19.649433050108804
stage antecedent to the human. An outlandish delegate sustained against	 115.6755712464002
both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the	 85.14101015789913
theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his	 76.40759773122446
authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of	 74.57072759912033
the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down	 36.12028303070182
to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses. The impression made by his	 36.45362059725516
words was immediate but shortlived. It was effaced as easily as it had	 62.84490152814728
been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of	 51.62742342217505
pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as	 47.88278487542902
the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man. Contemporaneously,	 56.02957611482438
a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr	 70.15176953048892
Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created	 29.159439710204715
in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty	 16.624463222043115
by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant	 77.37497180357066
submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus. Hitherto silent, whether the	 64.1060568059934
better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the	 91.30137683471332
garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he	 60.73996098947094
delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the	 102.03559974891917
ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has	 86.87057350272543
joined.	 4.608171674364364
But Malachias’ tale began to freeze them with horror. He conjured up	 79.91877604414526
the scene before them. The secret panel beside the chimney slid back	 77.76501129555731
and in the recess appeared... Haines! Which of us did not feel his	 164.6121783399744
flesh creep! He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand,	 57.0009580755503
in the other a phial marked _Poison._ Surprise, horror, loathing were	 84.59224500628217
depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin. I	 36.97167166480433
anticipated some such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for	 85.45471958351982
which, it seems, history is to blame. Yes, it is true. I am the	 37.57916968419892
murderer of Samuel Childs. And how I am punished! The inferno has no	 38.63455888418322
terrors for me. This is the appearance is on me. Tare and ages, what	 78.64313462708098
way would I be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping	 70.68094699923948
Dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the	 164.00517820736948
like of a soulth or a bullawurrus? My hell, and Ireland’s, is in this	 77.13832473822777
life. It is what I tried to obliterate my crime. Distractions,	 29.45627524239381
rookshooting, the Erse language (he recited some), laudanum (he raised	 44.86637000000483
the phial to his lips), camping out. In vain! His spectre stalks me.	 29.204877973894753
Dope is my only hope... Ah! Destruction! The black panther! With a cry	 60.86946262241993
he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back. An instant later his head	 71.5014417743303
appeared in the door opposite and said: Meet me at Westland Row station	 73.51001253942619
at ten past eleven. He was gone. Tears gushed from the eyes of the	 73.76869873689502
dissipated host. The seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The	 41.592374152147805
vendetta of Mananaun! The sage repeated: _Lex talionis_. The	 19.531418823284596
sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense	 60.22111628789354
debtorship for a thing done. Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased.	 36.31096699226802
The mystery was unveiled. Haines was the third brother. His real name	 115.61183460187
was Childs. The black panther was himself the ghost of his own father.	 40.25665430515293
He drank drugs to obliterate. For this relief much thanks. The lonely	 115.23025563557725
house by the graveyard is uninhabited. No soul will live there. The	 63.12886630772278
spider pitches her web in the solitude. The nocturnal rat peers from	 22.095657552135002
his hole. A curse is on it. It is haunted. Murderer’s ground.	 120.27216871825208
What is the age of the soul of man? As she hath the virtue of the	 34.87707656423764
chameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the	 68.38910239560856
merry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as	 122.88448653175698
her mood. No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing	 103.38131741520994
the cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a	 9.855156856927913
modest substance in the funds. A score of years are blown away. He is	 36.1512328765451
young Leopold. There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror	 95.6221572325467
within a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself. That young figure	 89.9939532795383
of then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from	 99.54014311063061
the old house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel	 35.845746809070704
on him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a	 39.030270228720426
mother’s thought. Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in	 99.80940040864743
his first hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a	 58.391142572457504
fullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook,	 31.677805957346052
a scented handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright	 177.02606837486206
trinketware (alas! a thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of	 46.25275336189293
compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out	 56.184411294857064
upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but	 74.98678468906314
the heart? tell me!) his studied baisemoins. The scent, the smile, but,	 155.6587480752338
more than these, the dark eyes and oleaginous address, brought home at	 90.43567701492297
duskfall many a commission to the head of the firm, seated with Jacob’s	 44.30723425372343
pipe after like labours in the paternal ingle (a meal of noodles, you	 59.09242233359577
may be sure, is aheating), reading through round horned spectacles some	 253.79627840798412
paper from the Europe of a month before. But hey, presto, the mirror is	 100.39910976884362
breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a	 35.005167998742046
tiny speck within the mist. Now he is himself paternal and these about	 78.54916636669113
him might be his sons. Who can say? The wise father knows his own	 113.24897786352699
child. He thinks of a drizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the	 35.11362309231811
bonded stores there, the first. Together (she is a poor waif, a child	 117.10203086663215
of shame, yours and mine and of all for a bare shilling and her	 88.36161156501802
luckpenny), together they hear the heavy tread of the watch as two	 91.97179794880415
raincaped shadows pass the new royal university. Bridie! Bridie Kelly!	 79.22898671357817
He will never forget the name, ever remember the night: first night,	 50.49848984802595
the bridenight. They are entwined in nethermost darkness, the willer	 21.522667412005053
with the willed, and in an instant (_fiat!_) light shall flood the	 50.69033418187337
world. Did heart leap to heart? Nay, fair reader. In a breath ’twas	 136.67383914039033
done but—hold! Back! It must not be! In terror the poor girl flees away	 124.83218190898108
through the murk. She is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night.	 77.37553441365499
She dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day. No, Leopold. Name and	 164.21316386964963
memory solace thee not. That youthful illusion of thy strength was	 103.32674134451048
taken from thee—and in vain. No son of thy loins is by thee. There is	 121.20041119774874
none now to be for Leopold, what Leopold was for Rudolph.	 206.01034527609883
The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the	 36.939567533038925
infinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over	 98.86732249428093
regions of cycles of generations that have lived. A region where grey	 45.1756377691828
twilight ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields,	 101.29595792552084
shedding her dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars. She follows her	 36.682505701939505
mother with ungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal. Twilight	 147.1222038715107
phantoms are they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim	 90.31746043343334
shapely haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull.	 260.2120087584736
They fade, sad phantoms: all is gone. Agendath is a waste land, a home	 110.3366627529544
of screechowls and the sandblind upupa. Netaim, the golden, is no more.	 43.956929775106325
And on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of	 56.24674648491563
rebellion, the ghosts of beasts. Huuh! Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks	 27.37419385705931
behind and goads them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are	 57.3939065595523
scorpions. Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and	 7.271908136414962
mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, _Lacus Mortis_. Ominous	 19.641930009069405
revengeful zodiacal host! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned	 100.1626841671101
and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the	 12.170005348612438
giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all	 7.763835380434656
their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun.	 28.73947544565321
Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible	 48.13538744819223
gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood. And the equine	 26.522333264151044
portent grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven’s	 35.21256576550036
own magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo. And lo,	 91.31241053872301
wonder of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger	 118.7519550040114
of the daystar, the bride, ever virgin. It is she, Martha, thou lost	 55.93815661618673
one, Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant. How serene does she	 296.5747708498396
now arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan	 22.4386236793612
hour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you	 47.380839973836316
call it gossamer. It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and	 48.94787329182939
loose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on	 147.46178035452556
currents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply	 46.975527823023754
swirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a	 35.2827329393948
myriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled	 48.56778311471811
sign upon the forehead of Taurus.	 66.63067881984045
Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at	 158.92456181961023
school together in Conmee’s time. He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades,	 74.97580656648182
Pisistratus. Where were they now? Neither knew. You have spoken of the	 86.32385651951067
past and its phantoms, Stephen said. Why think of them? If I call them	 84.63140198668849
into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to	 46.29533984649929
my call? Who supposes it? I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending	 49.37161100716964
bard, am lord and giver of their life. He encircled his gadding hair	 87.92572968518088
with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent. That answer and those	 61.20241297836692
leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something	 150.26416666267983
more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your	 70.451672751744
genius father. All who wish you well hope this for you. All desire to	 311.2356686561328
see you bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you	 67.61036848999474
Stephaneforos. I heartily wish you may not fail them. O no, Vincent	 85.80644079748673
Lenehan said, laying a hand on the shoulder near him. Have no fear. He	 72.05731319625492
could not leave his mother an orphan. The young man’s face grew dark.	 85.10001535864629
All could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and	 58.162156867368594
of his recent loss. He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the	 52.49119201815406
noise of voices allayed the smart. Madden had lost five drachmas on	 169.577855069638
Sceptre for a whim of the rider’s name: Lenehan as much more. He told	 65.69671738409404
them of the race. The flag fell and, huuh! off, scamper, the mare ran	 73.35084996389956
out freshly with O. Madden up. She was leading the field. All hearts	 112.52855968492166
were beating. Even Phyllis could not contain herself. She waved her	 100.83747148736781
scarf and cried: Huzzah! Sceptre wins! But in the straight on the run	 178.26511415544374
home when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level,	 193.6901723861185
reached, outstripped her. All was lost now. Phyllis was silent: her	 152.41407618889104
eyes were sad anemones. Juno, she cried, I am undone. But her lover	 70.84551464523713
consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which lay some	 99.83885620460042
oval sugarplums which she partook. A tear fell: one only. A whacking	 88.87188803564638
fine whip, said Lenehan, is W. Lane. Four winners yesterday and three	 169.9753556285105
today. What rider is like him? Mount him on the camel or the boisterous	 53.91617351901812
buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his. But let us bear it	 33.21921993346685
as was the ancient wont. Mercy on the luckless! Poor Sceptre! he said	 64.33876124329771
with a light sigh. She is not the filly that she was. Never, by this	 54.49552776275095
hand, shall we behold such another. By gad, sir, a queen of them. Do	 188.04161749611418
you remember her, Vincent? I wish you could have seen my queen today,	 109.31930136764355
Vincent said. How young she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fair	 167.36808259524508
beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the	 44.59602533527633
right name of it. The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air	 114.38867992654183
drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us. In	 92.27858296775773
the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of	 28.15344316819092
those buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his	 49.38438798988274
booth near the bridge. But she had nought for her teeth but the arm	 94.12023490339469
with which I held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when I	 77.3788610723784
pressed too close. A week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but	 158.52768037059764
today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril. She is more taking then.	 116.52997829230306
Her posies too! Mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we	 53.3060956061078
reclined together. And in your ear, my friend, you will not think who	 72.27453511927037
met us as we left the field. Conmee himself! He was walking by the	 101.22321494995423
hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty	 112.99728952373643
letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page. The sweet creature	 77.89987159431197
turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight	 79.21369894885642
disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very	 35.92641287365273
trees adore her. When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo	 127.0284977949923
in that little mirror she carries. But he had been kind. In going by he	 88.08201931009135
had blessed us. The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said. If I had poor	 97.2202485170417
luck with Bass’s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more	 96.87066480287174
propensely. He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and	 56.055841596045845
withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label.	 52.037887416724054
Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence. His soul is far	 153.94330257284176
away. It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be	 64.24244293111099
born. Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the	 51.09975120693688
incorruptible eon of the gods. Do you not think it, Stephen? Theosophos	 33.28541550737629
told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian	 85.37694286580628
priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law. The lords of the	 38.827138327743995
moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of	 32.55837388934099
the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were	 40.286617675254135
therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second	 30.841099358087753
constellation.	 4.608171674364364
However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him	 43.57167454007827
being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which	 50.76116131554097
was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was	 30.647252736058928
not the case at all. The individual whose visual organs while the above	 115.64532298092516
was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of	 54.364171275571614
animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody	 82.2694257629951
that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty	 86.13461183264535
speedily in the wrong shop. During the past four minutes or thereabouts	 42.36587466065889
he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled	 20.105033990467472
by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent which happened to be situated	 55.90136353216282
amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was	 102.98194844673037
certainly calculated to attract anyone’s remark on account of its	 50.93246546626238
scarlet appearance. He was simply and solely, as it subsequently	 61.112060061453356
transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an	 156.2458241118378
altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment	 37.0999011646033
before’s observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two	 62.19640431482841
or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as	 99.68397474824168
mutually innocent of as the babe unborn. Eventually, however, both	 139.0380134508269
their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other	 36.63498276797566
was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily	 57.87561211309955
determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the	 67.78693982254039
neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid	 107.83323692293128
sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out	 91.9965194247193
with, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of	 46.781304556049754
attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it	 66.0701490210726
about the place.	 151.49909460544166
The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the	 20.627120485559395
course of life. Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity. The	 66.24778447299693
debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on	 25.857497826705252
the loftiest and most vital. The high hall of Horne’s house had never	 36.68792408453158
beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old	 103.6731741173065
rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so	 55.83076886606425
encyclopaedic. A gallant scene in truth it made. Crotthers was there at	 100.5658846518758
the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing	 57.833365727857874
from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway. There too, opposite to	 18.531247563194768
him, was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early	 163.9124905140135
depravity and premature wisdom. Next the Scotchman was the place	 64.82303696593841
assigned to Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in	 76.08726166122791
stolid repose the squat form of Madden. The chair of the resident	 50.84348701658139
indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the	 84.94047743977572
figure of Bannon in explorer’s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide	 20.013229172565097
brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred	 74.37426210689499
manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan. Lastly at the head of the	 30.291367016062754
board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of	 64.3153537197495
pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of	 6.234790835689884
Socratic discussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated	 161.92124178366973
the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that	 29.876778701370448
vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained	 29.765919996670924
by the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and	 30.877348006325583
constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever	 62.11908690313802
efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired	 17.275170315776656
pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come.	 109.43715407381714
It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted	 41.447497914426656
transcendentalism to which Mr S. Dedalus’ (Div. Scep.) contentions	 22.522732303362464
would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter	 146.6350496507523
to accepted scientific methods. Science, it cannot be too often	 116.03086676572315
repeated, deals with tangible phenomena. The man of science like the	 69.2967573886314
man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked	 59.645980210836484
and explain them as best he can. There may be, it is true, some	 146.22261913760053
questions which science cannot answer—at present—such as the first	 70.37145061839885
problem submitted by Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) regarding the future	 61.50977318347338
determination of sex. Must we accept the view of Empedocles of	 53.891965844821534
Trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert	 34.46534165450841
others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long	 139.36301954508733
neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is	 14.890434303691315
it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper,	 38.498694251934076
Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture	 12.508933251369612
of both? This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature’s	 87.72659011434718
favourite devices) between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on	 22.261844390094698
the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, _succubitus	 38.699200682952366
felix_, of the passive element. The other problem raised by the same	 24.633267257796323
inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality. It is interesting	 76.42778054702204
because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but	 37.779535696403336
we all die in different ways. Mr M. Mulligan (Hyg. et Eug. Doc.) blames	 85.74865248733317
the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract	 11.381719925304141
adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc. by inhaling the bacteria which lurk	 18.750740793333076
in dust. These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles	 51.833786446050176
offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers	 31.045383251578667
of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic	 17.738181897520086
cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors	 10.65225431054956
and unfructified duennas—these, he said, were accountable for any and	 45.570793935937736
every fallingoff in the calibre of the race. Kalipedia, he prophesied,	 18.50739757074142
would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely	 17.74244224906191
good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive	 430.0971943137013
pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as	 46.8231952622686
Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all	 57.57373321175474
these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular	 143.68577678076525
condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner. Mr	 108.3726626125963
J. Crotthers (Disc. Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to	 64.22533363553357
abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy	 28.027437388514873
labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by	 27.498684347388018
far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in	 101.75745952035989
the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or	 12.42982960448836
in the atrocious crime of infanticide. Although the former (we are	 18.282616154958113
thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of	 58.06789987734252
nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too	 12.663531227313666
rare to be normative. In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder	 79.96977557190951
is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do,	 46.51711706771845
all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which	 45.47304556593956
often baulk nature in her intentions. An ingenious suggestion is that	 74.94660890717869
thrown out by Mr V. Lynch (Bacc. Arith.) that both natality and	 36.48530177565188
mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal	 17.288597218715122
movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general,	 53.82266559340805
everything, in fine, in nature’s vast workshop from the extinction of	 62.44807097341545
some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which	 45.01021932012122
beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet	 53.28850651440888
unascertained. Still the plain straightforward question why a child of	 89.2583210465826
normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly	 63.10835737562561
looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other	 111.18093277110988
children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet’s	 55.95986663869729
words, give us pause. Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and	 150.20843407993956
cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths	 152.88994923479854
are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous	 45.94139806515768
germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively	 70.38350235554469
shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend	 53.52564416150297
to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an	 42.4395283709479
arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings	 193.49362319832503
(notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long	 60.91257804037001
run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival	 62.10862686616649
of the fittest. Mr S. Dedalus’ (Div. Scep.) remark (or should it be	 71.47511161848747
called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate,	 127.23871108929274
deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with	 26.67318383705063
pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous	 18.475032964985495
females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not	 63.330712575353566
to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly	 50.904210131968576
find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals	 99.86705670196827
as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above	 89.05378596932573
alluded to. For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately	 26.48329607369553
acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this	 12.31996650571207
morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening	 22.80799761085504
bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid	 72.71870597659054
from an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated	 171.36607411744296
that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed	 33.44771401851223
victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly	 19.452709052284014
dropped from its mother. In a recent public controversy with Mr L.	 117.96642600593556
Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) which took place in the commons’ hall of the	 21.382851407567486
National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, of which, as	 88.1472795179351
is well known, Dr A. Horne (Lic. in Midw., F. K. Q. C. P. I.) is the	 74.81555084162271
able and popular master, he is reported by eyewitnesses as having	 147.96812032326943
stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag (an esthete’s	 131.2060360261271
allusion, presumably, to one of the most complicated and marvellous of	 21.593545170060743
all nature’s processes—the act of sexual congress) she must let it out	 64.69599338182455
again or give it life, as he phrased it, to save her own. At the risk	 86.65775984183121
of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the	 80.03048929225143
less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was	 45.01180204644535
delivered.	 5757.389109386618
Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a	 31.42089996164552
happy _accouchement._ It had been a weary weary while both for patient	 104.51580309392276
and doctor. All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave	 125.15523666194252
woman had manfully helped. She had. She had fought the good fight and	 67.78450358957772
now she was very very happy. Those who have passed on, who have gone	 137.91147361359907
before, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching	 218.1585591635937
scene. Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the	 53.33468890667618
motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty	 84.79868618574241
sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood,	 81.3052001105294
breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal	 124.52108227196054
Husband. And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one	 90.28939031641691
blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy,	 126.28356174355469
to lay in his arms that mite of God’s clay, the fruit of their lawful	 61.719453740831426
embraces. He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle	 72.0799868022343
stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity	 85.09750844558437
has come to the conscientious second accountant of the Ulster bank,	 56.78817656757495
College Green branch. O Doady, loved one of old, faithful lifemate now,	 127.83085930637841
it may never be again, that faroff time of the roses! With the old	 62.92894733416461
shake of her pretty head she recalls those days. God! How beautiful now	 79.72287792660303
across the mist of years! But their children are grouped in her	 46.16849207355481
imagination about the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice,	 88.6521404948044
Frederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances),	 69.33256756754731
Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little Bobsy (called after our	 125.61680429350746
famous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs of Waterford and	 48.68921642122857
Candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a Purefoy if ever	 96.9690774237165
there was one, with the true Purefoy nose. Young hopeful will be	 131.7869278320136
christened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousin of Mr	 51.343873013131564
Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer’s office, Dublin Castle. And so	 75.79850655033877
time wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here. No, let no	 264.4823871853368
sigh break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina. And Doady, knock the	 203.9794446725822
ashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the	 108.41246161109734
curfew rings for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light	 81.66205492849602
whereby you read in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so	 76.92563175226861
with a tranquil heart to bed, to rest. He knows and will call in His	 68.64254815323945
own good time. You too have fought the good fight and played loyally	 91.02666092024569
your man’s part. Sir, to you my hand. Well done, thou good and faithful	 288.12700947809145
servant!	 25266.71737672707
There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil	 79.01194157556722
memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the	 30.053586223564782
heart but they abide there and wait. He may suffer their memory to grow	 134.61907396168942
dim, let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade	 87.70334528334837
himself that they were not or at least were otherwise. Yet a chance	 148.96861229631784
word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront	 65.19294443807765
him in the most various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while	 73.90177495328169
timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility	 77.31649716912523
of the evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with	 79.38208458849623
wine. Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies	 213.49023730022978
under her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but	 84.99777970380298
shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote,	 12.919793727599417
reproachful.	 4.608171674364364
The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of	 54.31610658630662
that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied	 125.17174318483652
trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an	 103.22345969453575
unhealthiness, a _flair,_ for the cruder things of life. A scene	 44.93910086039434
disengages itself in the observer’s memory, evoked, it would seem, by a	 42.571078338966544
word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present	 133.30644929450975
there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures. A shaven space	 124.98942996211612
of lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at	 103.1016728711704
Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game	 72.27515573039476
but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward	 71.86621683624954
over the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief	 78.27449671973811
alert shock. And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at	 54.44132434900933
times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood,	 56.51341787047522
Floey, Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of	 139.72509864146653
arresting in her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of	 25.755789337377184
them pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin	 90.31965642056011
so daintily against the cool ardent fruit. A lad of four or five in	 124.31178519314027
linseywoolsey (blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth	 38.13592957495795
when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the	 54.59727048834052
urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands. He frowns a little	 46.243428303845185
just as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment	 166.8878532331353
of the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother	 182.00136697802816
watches from the _piazzetta_ giving upon the flowerclose with a faint	 48.25457003640991
shadow of remoteness or of reproach (_alles Vergängliche_) in her glad	 36.53213819940093
look.	 916.721424060204
Mark this farther and remember. The end comes suddenly. Enter that	 321.5103168965016
antechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their	 40.24144070428445
faces. Nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent. Quietude of	 66.7064111047244
custody, rather, befitting their station in that house, the vigilant	 56.42946453872372
watch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in Bethlehem of Juda long	 46.97825345140222
ago. But as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with	 316.4777298407957
preponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended,	 12.343163638575895
compass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched	 125.97910422149177
field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in	 29.67548271062444
an instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of	 35.089421100492636
the thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was	 77.20732629567871
the transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of	 33.83398705098113
the word.	 90.64604619166981
Burke’s! outflings my lord Stephen, giving the cry, and a tag and	 80.40253625696701
bobtail of all them after, cockerel, jackanapes, welsher, pilldoctor,	 16.941478084098556
punctual Bloom at heels with a universal grabbing at headgear,	 54.69208026575299
ashplants, bilbos, Panama hats and scabbards, Zermatt alpenstocks and	 18.968220770038407
what not. A dedale of lusty youth, noble every student there. Nurse	 145.7827530405402
Callan taken aback in the hallway cannot stay them nor smiling surgeon	 152.71906618849286
coming downstairs with news of placentation ended, a full pound if a	 128.36859890258444
milligramme. They hark him on. The door! It is open? Ha! They are out,	 46.15276983620803
tumultuously, off for a minute’s race, all bravely legging it, Burke’s	 72.09222971882673
of Denzille and Holles their ulterior goal. Dixon follows giving them	 83.9949254113264
sharp language but raps out an oath, he too, and on. Bloom stays with	 175.00616148410435
nurse a thought to send a kind word to happy mother and nurseling up	 215.57941598862774
there. Doctor Diet and Doctor Quiet. Looks she too not other now? Ward	 231.41586851064338
of watching in Horne’s house has told its tale in that washedout	 105.72298930385895
pallor. Then all being gone, a glance of motherwit helping, he whispers	 41.50994094300071
close in going: Madam, when comes the storkbird for thee?	 130.9921406558574
The air without is impregnated with raindew moisture, life essence	 71.74020423788076
celestial, glistening on Dublin stone there under starshiny _coelum._	 76.06249422206464
God’s air, the Allfather’s air, scintillant circumambient cessile air.	 80.39560390452523
Breathe it deep into thee. By heaven, Theodore Purefoy, thou hast done	 263.2037591775563
a doughty deed and no botch! Thou art, I vow, the remarkablest	 30.13443552588934
progenitor barring none in this chaffering allincluding most	 42.12012697477748
farraginous chronicle. Astounding! In her lay a Godframed Godgiven	 15.865018866700884
preformed possibility which thou hast fructified with thy modicum of	 22.96039433282446
man’s work. Cleave to her! Serve! Toil on, labour like a very bandog	 102.6050113707257
and let scholarment and all Malthusiasts go hang. Thou art all their	 75.4021218331174
daddies, Theodore. Art drooping under thy load, bemoiled with butcher’s	 62.74124647984425
bills at home and ingots (not thine!) in the countinghouse? Head up!	 52.36724980443929
For every newbegotten thou shalt gather thy homer of ripe wheat. See,	 77.75024624496457
thy fleece is drenched. Dost envy Darby Dullman there with his Joan? A	 22.002669191521207
canting jay and a rheumeyed curdog is all their progeny. Pshaw, I tell	 21.7779193125501
thee! He is a mule, a dead gasteropod, without vim or stamina, not	 62.12453450275249
worth a cracked kreutzer. Copulation without population! No, say I!	 85.3639280168901
Herod’s slaughter of the innocents were the truer name. Vegetables,	 18.205842227383105
forsooth, and sterile cohabitation! Give her beefsteaks, red, raw,	 25.17896186551967
bleeding! She is a hoary pandemonium of ills, enlarged glands, mumps,	 19.09631057746581
quinsy, bunions, hayfever, bedsores, ringworm, floating kidney,	 16.223255731491147
Derbyshire neck, warts, bilious attacks, gallstones, cold feet,	 40.824607582552325
varicose veins. A truce to threnes and trentals and jeremies and all	 19.244119716446477
such congenital defunctive music! Twenty years of it, regret them not.	 75.87030271146098
With thee it was not as with many that will and would and wait and	 193.85689552876607
never—do. Thou sawest thy America, thy lifetask, and didst charge to	 44.593572353345586
cover like the transpontine bison. How saith Zarathustra? _Deine Kuh	 35.99341305744366
Trübsal melkest Du. Nun Trinkst Du die süsse Milch des Euters_. See! it	 69.12495221902122
displodes for thee in abundance. Drink, man, an udderful! Mother’s	 114.93099210460394
milk, Purefoy, the milk of human kin, milk too of those burgeoning	 120.85786209241546
stars overhead rutilant in thin rainvapour, punch milk, such as those	 150.02305073928267
rioters will quaff in their guzzling den, milk of madness, the	 23.81138982487529
honeymilk of Canaan’s land. Thy cow’s dug was tough, what? Ay, but her	 42.293322140845916
milk is hot and sweet and fattening. No dollop this but thick rich	 129.5444116672791
bonnyclaber. To her, old patriarch! Pap! _Per deam Partulam et	 28.88292937780591

mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru	 29.77412962379465
Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level, Bloom for Bloom. He passes,	 182.2530955625247
struck by the stare of truculent Wellington, but in the convex mirror	 40.86702590794477

_At Antonio Rabaiotti’s door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright	 52.139883784087644
arclamp. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)_	 18.041456249047794
BLOOM: Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!	 100.80375821036549
_(He disappears into Olhausen’s, the porkbutcher’s, under the	 23.072799393513712
downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the	 27.033644662309253
shutter, puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a	 73.54308214105299
parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig’s crubeen, the other a cold	 68.99140230912103
sheep’s trotter, sprinkled with wholepepper. He gasps, standing	 15.935944615191865
upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his ribs	 77.35168574786528
and groans.)_	 15.372472535691111
BLOOM: Stitch in my side. Why did I run?	 52.04739449750989
_(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset	 65.38829919152218
siding. The glow leaps again.)_	 37.88008755777056
BLOOM: What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.	 17.712344364473896
_(He stands at Cormack’s corner, watching.)_	 77.12147296437935
BLOOM: _Aurora borealis_ or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of	 56.93679806801057
course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar’s	 179.4355617429186
bush. We’re safe. _(He hums cheerfully.)_ London’s burning, London’s	 40.78375038604711
burning! On fire, on fire! (_He catches sight of the navvy lurching	 77.03727568465152
through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street._) I’ll miss	 52.19380453901142
him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.	 250.79805230255045
_(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)_	 72.52889345114778
THE URCHINS: Mind out, mister!	 109.90695829705962
(_Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him,	 119.85088496704503
grazing him, their bells rattling._)	 49.775514736973356
THE BELLS: Haltyaltyaltyall.	 73.10145368822008
BLOOM: _(Halts erect, stung by a spasm.)_ Ow!	 40.779423070235026
_(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon	 59.95772518744655
sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its	 52.83563424497778
huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The	 58.609717193130514
motorman bangs his footgong.)_	 8.386719950520101
THE GONG: Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.	 38.17456100158594
_(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman’s whitegloved	 28.497206407109978
hand, blunders stifflegged out of the track. The motorman, thrown	 16.727593509266626
forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over	 31.58023268443618
chains and keys.)_	 56.58405530931858
THE MOTORMAN: Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hat trick?	 23.221068070735313
_(Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a	 26.868817534439742
mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.)_	 30.24581978921779
BLOOM: No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must	 80.29109540507544
take up Sandow’s exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against	 82.81649311726984
street accident too. The Providential. _(He feels his trouser pocket.)_	 47.53787753501946
Poor mamma’s panacea. Heel easily catch in track or bootlace in a cog.	 59.35260806147423
Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard’s	 64.56101063969187
corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought	 92.67238570512909
to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked	 74.77367473799931
me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of	 97.63114171849384
him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful	 65.81949743698347
cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why?	 107.68855317840932
Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. _(He closes his eyes an	 87.47362526956509
instant.)_ Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other.	 134.40373126645403
Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!	 41.48995198661249
_(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O’Beirne’s wall, a	 78.05259395099404
visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved	 40.75420518588696
sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)_	 96.65089626111555
BLOOM: _Buenas noches, señorita Blanca, que calle es esta?_	 4.739104453824727
THE FIGURE: (_Impassive, raises a signal arm._) Password. _Sraid	 85.92643751868009

BLOOM: Haha. _Merci._ Esperanto. _Slan leath. (He mutters.)_ Gaelic	 19.053600592482347

left, ragsackman left.)_	 329.03981483076626
BLOOM: I beg.	 80.82680885942386
(_He leaps right, sackragman right._)	 199.63278277914713
BLOOM: I beg.	 80.82680885942386
(_He swerves, sidles, stepaside, slips past and on._)	 66.36694705189491
BLOOM: Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a signpost planted	 32.495914767358684
by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who	 86.87620111681714
lost my way and contributed to the columns of the _Irish Cyclist_ the	 25.57213917385716
letter headed _In darkest Stepaside_. Keep, keep, keep to the right.	 51.606547769431955
Rags and bones at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer	 45.96136091262477

_(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against	 46.466811317768176
Bloom.)_	 75.63006035870652
BLOOM: O.	 186.07593184021047
_(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there.	 60.29519460258384
Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket,	 26.48097064655507
pursepoke, sweets of sin, potato soap.)_	 55.503569949735684
BLOOM: Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves’ dodge. Collide. Then snatch	 20.63933313201574
your purse.	 327.7169469672464
_(The retriever approaches sniffing, nose to the ground. A sprawled	 52.51950569356658
form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long	 45.96255283690877
caftan of an elder in Zion and a smokingcap with magenta tassels.	 17.649298153108
Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison	 88.98471644924749
streaks are on the drawn face.)_	 166.34503853915777
RUDOLPH: Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with	 172.67188379922112
drunken goy ever. So you catch no money.	 155.6464508348141
BLOOM: _(Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and,	 35.301773562883355
crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat.) Ja, ich weiss, papachi._	 24.70768551278846
RUDOLPH: What you making down this place? Have you no soul? _(With	 220.8092412527791
feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom.)_ Are you not	 33.86932804462375
my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son	 44.45309866530338
Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his	 52.510813072792814
fathers Abraham and Jacob?	 216.94544220597555
BLOOM: _(With precaution.)_ I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that’s	 80.73064158130826
left of him.	 389.9540945495881
RUDOLPH: _(Severely.)_ One night they bring you home drunk as dog after	 193.30314820743882
spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?	 123.79417817267559
BLOOM: _(In youth’s smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips,	 112.31142399008762
narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent’s sterling silver	 101.31919607900876
waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one	 102.48953057357058
side of him coated with stiffening mud.)_ Harriers, father. Only that	 46.275409742136006
once.	 4132.683032344385
RUDOLPH: Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make	 188.4278902465017
you kaputt, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.	 126.92740040568037
BLOOM: _(Weakly.)_ They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I	 28.175556448880382
slipped.	 12781.746800446992
RUDOLPH: _(With contempt.) Goim nachez!_ Nice spectacles for your poor	 70.2512568801862
mother!	 1707.7951385720298
BLOOM: Mamma!	 177.57225419395752
ELLEN BLOOM: _(In pantomime dame’s stringed mobcap, widow Twankey’s	 25.225474481018097

grey mittens and cameo brooch, her plaited hair in a crispine net,	 21.179571414881732
appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her	 38.04174668973939
hand, and cries out in shrill alarm.)_ O blessed Redeemer, what have	 149.2010966479041
they done to him! My smelling salts! _(She hauls up a reef of skirt and	 43.159904696917884
ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus	 19.159987143851904
Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.)_ Sacred Heart	 48.719157892805704

his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)_	 45.96206906504724
A VOICE: _(Sharply.)_ Poldy!	 80.59766117781741
BLOOM: Who? _(He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.)_ At your	 60.7114419555116
service.	 13781.811868011273
_(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in	 54.28056485179286
Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet	 78.24858555103798
trousers and jacket, slashed with gold. A wide yellow cummerbund	 97.3860162975278
girdles her. A white yashmak, violet in the night, covers her face,	 78.26030084172668
leaving free only her large dark eyes and raven hair.)_	 232.6556678854202
BLOOM: Molly!	 210.4190096603651
MARION: Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to	 129.91142087664073
me. _(Satirically.)_ Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?	 118.05795839176704
BLOOM: _(Shifts from foot to foot.)_ No, no. Not the least little bit.	 94.83589744512861
_(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air, questions,	 29.519543758277482
hopes, crubeens for her supper, things to tell her, excuse, desire,	 77.45531391972273
spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled	 32.383355017166494
toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a	 47.21388881067372
camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of	 28.283708585147657
innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with	 17.833501675837937
disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb	 13.163334020338597
wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)_	 26.436552914897312
MARION: Nebrakada! Femininum!	 51.208256644954446
_(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a large mango fruit,	 44.86876267333016
offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof, then droops	 68.3163577469448
his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom	 73.49958655545073
stoops his back for leapfrog.)_	 41.32977109988946
BLOOM: I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer... Mrs	 49.934293413715
Marion... if you...	 119.26114756072342
MARION: So you notice some change? _(Her hands passing slowly over her	 195.56605521543605
trinketed stomacher, a slow friendly mockery in her eyes.)_ O Poldy,	 48.40918718025262
Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the	 105.82648876470124
wide world.	 1106.3535606548987
BLOOM: I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower	 19.88687233286672
water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the	 71.19454471369329
morning. _(He pats divers pockets.)_ This moving kidney. Ah!	 422.0646041907785
_(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon	 100.15675408693892
soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)_	 145.70744000481827
THE SOAP:	 187.7220241104773
We’re a capital couple are Bloom and I.	 194.30170721878793
He brightens the earth. I polish the sky.	 44.06282109145623
_(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the	 20.519877651573122
soapsun.)_	 4.608171674364364
SWENY: Three and a penny, please.	 139.75325362930687
BLOOM: Yes. For my wife. Mrs Marion. Special recipe.	 92.24009666978557
MARION: _(Softly.)_ Poldy!	 870.0687286946006
BLOOM: Yes, ma’am?	 107.16671899230845
MARION: _Ti trema un poco il cuore?_	 56.3668718214747
_(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon,	 30.118205938161783
humming the duet from_ Don Giovanni.)	 58.53289990545904
BLOOM: Are you sure about that _Voglio_? I mean the pronunciati...	 48.615461065469944
_(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes	 51.77490831189791
his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)_	 20.331995064992594
THE BAWD: Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched.	 76.33394213931463
Fifteen. There’s no-one in it only her old father that’s dead drunk.	 116.17085698095846
_(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled,	 30.641815102522507
Bridie Kelly stands.)_	 174.27198858280414
BRIDIE: Hatch street. Any good in your mind?	 92.32823214017017
_(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues	 44.98650609197796
with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into	 21.891509244159284
gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)_	 99.1741464723721
THE BAWD: _(Her wolfeyes shining.)_ He’s getting his pleasure. You	 196.64200168679182
won’t get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don’t be all	 152.80804642393954
night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.	 44.565616138171116
_(Leering, Gerty Macdowell limps forward. She draws from behind,	 77.52733270978682
ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)_	 25.588236992938594
GERTY: With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. _(She murmurs.)_ You	 227.6649424864019
did that. I hate you.	 93.97760290295129
BLOOM: I? When? You’re dreaming. I never saw you.	 56.15289451040967
THE BAWD: Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman	 151.3662575335394
false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother	 68.68438597689561
take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.	 44.24030070808663
GERTY: _(To Bloom.)_ When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer.	 66.47222196176034
_(She paws his sleeve, slobbering.)_ Dirty married man! I love you for	 111.34469906552779
doing that to me.	 153.89204228190957
_(She glides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man’s frieze overcoat with	 74.83634198881616
loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes	 58.32527769110747
wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)_	 58.436047167664086
MRS BREEN: Mr...	 45.32085120435191
BLOOM: _(Coughs gravely.)_ Madam, when we last had this pleasure by	 114.28757794290271
letter dated the sixteenth instant...	 129.40403228258756

nicely! Scamp!	 198.0953873548797
BLOOM: _(Hurriedly.)_ Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think of me?	 71.80457866724524
Don’t give me away. Walls have ears. How do you do? It’s ages since I.	 41.859309900120664
You’re looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are	 53.56658996512553
having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here.	 287.9833807069027
Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women. Magdalen asylum. I am the	 54.259307720384626

MRS BREEN: _(Holds up a finger.)_ Now, don’t tell a big fib! I know	 60.276391937203165
somebody won’t like that. O just wait till I see Molly! _(Slily.)_	 96.16629281865316
Account for yourself this very sminute or woe betide you!	 134.08982598474765
BLOOM: _(Looks behind.)_ She often said she’d like to visit. Slumming.	 104.42416926813186
The exotic, you see. Negro servants in livery too if she had money.	 63.75684549481774
Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at	 52.51918235769837

BLOOM: _(With a sour tenderish smile.)_ A little frivol, shall we, if	 118.89185344736714
you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for	 101.69501691008527
a fraction of a second?	 26.49854393349894
MRS BREEN: _(Screams gaily.)_ O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!	 58.2676503731427
BLOOM: For old sake’ sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed	 87.20655977457496
marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a	 54.21386934241495
soft corner for you. _(Gloomily.)_ ’Twas I sent you that valentine of	 131.88711765812812

MRS BREEN: You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic	 28.162955349292787

MRS BREEN: _(Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.)_	 61.33516424861728
Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?	 64.77580431668952
BLOOM: _(Offhandedly.)_ Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without	 31.276205777618852

BLOOM: I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here.	 43.951091301782355
But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular	 91.09891624152114

fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and	 28.933556653654158
you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur	 43.12595574815052
that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to	 110.60266174492591
nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and	 37.828084008509
I’ll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...	 78.4725395610987
MRS BREEN: She did, of course, the cat! Don’t tell me! Nice adviser!	 58.04316863151817
BLOOM: Because it didn’t suit you one quarter as well as the other	 56.55231705657375
ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I	 42.920564954301746
admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though	 131.7166883945387

MRS BREEN: _(Squeezes his arm, simpers.)_ Naughty cruel I was!	 46.68254036274345
BLOOM: _(Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.)_ And Molly was eating a	 70.37959535160633
sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher’s lunch basket.	 183.64047768874528
Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much	 47.90069482747867
for her style. She was...	 68.12146158013053
MRS BREEN: Too...	 68.67851078293447
BLOOM: Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O’Reilly	 67.73050211042741
were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius	 36.314136759904464
Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter,	 94.55914295657367

feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers	 54.93205120927627
listen to a tale which their brokensnouted gaffer rasps out with	 43.928480380827224

maimed sodden playfight.)_	 4.206040932916629
THE GAFFER: _(Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.)_ And when	 26.13702770492076

THE LOITERERS: Jays, that’s a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the	 32.12545353468127
men’s porter.	 808.3515942462657

Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding	 118.98387088415043

SECOND WATCH: Prevention of cruelty to animals.	 48.393092527373085
BLOOM: _(Enthusiastically.)_ A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on	 52.38516278351498
Harold’s cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness	 55.908360169540785
scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the	 51.11909536837225
last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.	 46.0384671089257
_(Signor Maffei, passionpale, in liontamer’s costume with diamond studs	 20.05654319115361

boarhound.)_	 4.608171674364364
SIGNOR MAFFEI: _(With a sinister smile.)_ Ladies and gentlemen, my	 20.52526236932902
educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my	 17.859901703678602
patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a	 43.980297228861765
knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pulley will bring your	 28.14648740306249
lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even _Leo ferox_ there, the	 125.47258011784966

FIRST WATCH: Come. Name and address.	 112.50578390258161
BLOOM: I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! _(He takes off his	 38.249730635976505
high grade hat, saluting.)_ Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have	 55.92859525324391
heard of von Blum Pasha. Umpteen millions. _Donnerwetter!_ Owns half	 35.51928050435687

BLOOM: _(In red fez, cadi’s dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a	 104.99854487793695
false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and	 48.3586370476731
offers it.)_ Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors:	 62.30567612442442

SECOND WATCH: An alibi. You are cautioned.	 41.516813946269885
BLOOM: _(Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.)_ This	 97.14273781173159
is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don’t know his	 70.23918647276396
name. _(Plausibly.)_ You know that old joke, rose of Castile. Bloom.	 47.48336704734706
The change of name. Virag. _(He murmurs privately and confidentially.)_	 49.058622496253875
We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement.	 74.24196547585576
_(He shoulders the second watch gently.)_ Dash it all. It’s a way we	 88.64946249009718
gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. _(He turns gravely to	 66.13763469360498
the first watch.)_ Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo	 42.3229047311782
sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. _(To	 72.42296129196126
the second watch gaily.)_ I’ll introduce you, inspector. She’s game. Do	 99.93153833914874
it in the shake of a lamb’s tail.	 65.45412795934992

FIRST WATCH: _(Sternly.)_ Come to the station.	 50.04751896430919
BLOOM: _(Scared, hats himself, steps back, then, plucking at his heart	 163.02284849812378
and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and	 45.33475752204292
dueguard of fellowcraft.)_ No, no, worshipful master, light of love.	 58.70549310510779
Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember	 34.2474110152489
the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a	 214.69217373453503
hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than	 32.27610495676876
ninetynine wrongfully condemned.	 70.21973531410792
MARTHA: _(Sobbing behind her veil.)_ Breach of promise. My real name is	 88.55858082021625
Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I’ll tell my	 32.85281935663367
brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.	 26.007253138706265
BLOOM: _(Behind his hand.)_ She’s drunk. The woman is inebriated. _(He	 73.80841124550885
murmurs vaguely the pass of Ephraim.)_ Shitbroleeth.	 51.84895221045557
SECOND WATCH: _(Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.)_ You ought to be	 40.20346868555037
thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.	 82.40913078679499
BLOOM: Gentlemen of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare’s nest. I am	 77.92136385712038
a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable	 44.856463692328234
married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street.	 88.8774005895309
My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant	 37.89015744838373
upstanding gentleman, what do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy,	 39.92507773288052
one of Britain’s fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his	 146.95860225126697
majority for the heroic defence of Rorke’s Drift.	 6.8896597834936735
FIRST WATCH: Regiment.	 22.426823431877512
BLOOM: _(Turns to the gallery.)_ The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of	 111.45819997721306
the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in	 66.09939520311173
arms up there among you. The R. D. F., with our own Metropolitan	 111.85918017420964
police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body	 35.65097926826721
of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.	 63.13880122133162
A VOICE: Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?	 45.09516891521623
BLOOM: _(His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.)_ My old dad too	 47.87655178498494
was a J. P. I’m as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with	 117.61574530288611
the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under general	 98.73815792582292
Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was	 18.678471378733995
mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. _(With quiet	 172.18326543227855
feeling.)_ Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.	 123.6696525956006
FIRST WATCH: Profession or trade.	 51.98734841455224
BLOOM: Well, I follow a literary occupation, author-journalist. In fact	 80.632510034857
we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am	 29.352683848182522
the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am	 58.55696502138734
connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...	 109.54928285128736
_(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His	 47.855880549274445
scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a	 37.70822175221249
hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a	 62.015624458095274

Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?	 157.6807736965297
_(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate	 20.476851450672623

portfolio labelled_ Matcham’s Masterstrokes.)	 4.045570071155129
BEAUFOY: _(Drawls.)_ No, you aren’t. Not by a long shot if I know it. I	 99.66584895756807
don’t see it, that’s all. No born gentleman, no-one with the most	 104.01271222735954
rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly	 35.146553678919034
loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak	 28.63664011153654
masquerading as a literateur. It’s perfectly obvious that with the most	 52.92747182644603
inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling copy, really	 46.36824482156762
gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath	 80.631100530344
suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions, with which	 94.44232290794059
your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout	 68.70011020772232
the kingdom.	 219.84870091243837
BLOOM: _(Murmurs with hangdog meekness glum.)_ That bit about the	 28.4362218573957
laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may...	 114.78177979990555
BEAUFOY: _(His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.)_ You	 134.5050849190084
funny ass, you! You’re too beastly awfully weird for words! I don’t	 169.16474897210284
think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard.	 137.08436966714652
My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord,	 69.4800876357359
we shall receive the usual witnesses’ fees, shan’t we? We are	 33.748281471535726
considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this	 116.72840340115424
jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.	 36.69512610484472
BLOOM: _(Indistinctly.)_ University of life. Bad art.	 130.1136138447107
BEAUFOY: _(Shouts.)_ It’s a damnably foul lie, showing the moral	 202.9628717429518
rottenness of the man! _(He extends his portfolio.)_ We have here	 28.172628256376726
damning evidence, the _corpus delicti_, my lord, a specimen of my	 68.31870281152862
maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.	 25.699675712736298

BEAUFOY: You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you	 40.26612595563231
rotter! _(To the court.)_ Why, look at the man’s private life! Leading	 41.719641554372366
a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be	 73.10068305558823
mentioned in mixed society! The archconspirator of the age!	 70.5965067649388
BLOOM: _(To the court.)_ And he, a bachelor, how...	 75.83796405845843
FIRST WATCH: The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.	 109.53870383023398
THE CRIER: Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!	 15.923430220384182
_(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket	 70.88936745179288
on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)_	 19.81493070375781
SECOND WATCH: Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?	 42.806991346020034
MARY DRISCOLL: _(Indignantly.)_ I’m not a bad one. I bear a respectable	 76.11302335378811
character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation,	 50.08795071355571
six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out and I had to leave	 74.40208229558242
owing to his carryings on.	 17.03247327989221
FIRST WATCH: What do you tax him with?	 29.603920596095985
MARY DRISCOLL: He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of	 66.25281064857575
myself as poor as I am.	 127.7929053119377
BLOOM: _(In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless	 22.356494550037397
slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled: softly.)_ I treated you white. I	 231.82975487077763
gave you mementos, smart emerald garters far above your station.	 125.96112302534883
Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering.	 41.395092807764506
There’s a medium in all things. Play cricket.	 42.809045430892844
MARY DRISCOLL: _(Excitedly.)_ As God is looking down on me this night	 58.18491350221767
if ever I laid a hand to them oylsters!	 106.1767086750794
FIRST WATCH: The offence complained of? Did something happen?	 80.52529803498321
MARY DRISCOLL: He surprised me in the rere of the premises, Your	 38.29722284286098
honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for	 106.66926508755488
a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a	 45.76964856477244
result. And he interfered twict with my clothing.	 16.897267216452025
BLOOM: She counterassaulted.	 116.37367589269495
MARY DRISCOLL: _(Scornfully.)_ I had more respect for the	 29.178205977930524
scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, Your lord, and he	 57.165998203251036
remarked: keep it quiet.	 72.95230716406711
_(General laughter.)_	 2246.512913001537
GEORGE FOTTRELL: _(Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.)_ Order in	 91.5881537413902
court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.	 97.51001227827285
_(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins	 61.468549014585086
a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say	 60.87422917579306
in his stirring address to the grand jury. He was down and out but,	 64.09026712228837
though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to	 51.62626758797877
reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and	 22.904319830310346
return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A sevenmonths’ child, he	 67.28521527134394
had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent.	 32.28434122952679
There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn	 53.92428670941837
over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping	 92.08671647723816
post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by	 79.73332656053599
the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An	 24.662819561637317
acclimatised Britisher, he had seen that summer eve from the footplate	 16.42395458507082
of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain	 56.67639376085475
refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of	 58.39139224713497
loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly	 28.29462991357876
rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell’s wallpaper at one	 42.957270650834836
and ninepence a dozen, innocent Britishborn bairns lisping prayers to	 23.558344747380353
the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums or	 30.296911417417714
model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour	 89.16196088960368
reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the	 57.1854545152218
boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what	 35.65483814268096
times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with	 12.485532787035767

Loosen his boots.	 45.15193094747805
PROFESSOR MACHUGH: _(From the presstable, coughs and calls.)_ Cough it	 73.0166570155533
up, man. Get it out in bits.	 146.09559530833286
_(The crossexamination proceeds_ re _Bloom and the bucket. A large	 48.21755774856794
bucket. Bloom himself. Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes.	 115.06232002660929
Quite bad. A plasterer’s bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered	 275.55584125437156
untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some	 166.74167807175357

a mess. Not completely. A_ Titbits _back number_.)	 80.01060013008117

stickingplaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)_	 25.66402902977056
J. J. O’MOLLOY: _(In barrister’s grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with	 33.308709483808215
a voice of pained protest.)_ This is no place for indecent levity at	 31.745268715927484
the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a	 39.58585521986064
beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My	 63.70769892376878
client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a	 64.44721461667943
stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up	 48.545298651921456
misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on	 24.745799420885046
by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence	 52.38117274510981
being quite permitted in my client’s native place, the land of the	 54.868843558091825
Pharaoh. _Prima facie_, I put it to you that there was no attempt at	 33.67521610782626
carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of	 49.41795863955913
by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would	 116.12251503410172
deal in especial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and	 16.857378915835113
somnambulism in my client’s family. If the accused could speak he could	 122.9377084455731
a tale unfold—one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between	 40.49011877682955
the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from	 49.48989189778295
cobbler’s weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian	 43.7409461515618
extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.	 52.04007275693712
BLOOM: _(Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar’s vest and trousers,	 30.781240892873306

him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches	 65.59059048257453

J. J. O’MOLLOY: _(Hotly to the populace.)_ This is a lonehand fight. By	 28.41304864603962
Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this	 38.95568969666215
fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has	 29.948344621887617
superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically,	 26.972313455118037
without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused	 52.599678407440734
was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered	 58.93759317534762
with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very	 89.39144711759788
own daughter. _(Bloom takes J. J. O’Molloy’s hand and raises it to his	 129.0662198077303
lips.)_ I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that	 70.68724403443683
the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute	 97.99546238545852
Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the	 33.18501681801229
world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object	 105.77691884724382
to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some	 129.12052239548325
dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will	 41.08446141893423
on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I	 50.94312713809044
know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his	 40.60326028307074
extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of	 37.20430275022135
which will now be shown. _(To Bloom.)_ I suggest that you will do the	 54.56407969250935
handsome thing.	 612.9139743547039

He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband	 69.74539387813994
was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed	 31.02680955587375
James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless	 59.19709210533787
globes as I sat in a box of the _Theatre Royal_ at a command	 54.10550532996042
performance of _La Cigale_. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made	 39.89725491583239
improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on	 35.44348745564626
the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the	 60.37330652852051
post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled _The Girl	 51.37406514200507
with the Three Pairs of Stays_.	 82.77635886877685

quizzing-glasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.)_	 34.64628091021092
Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because	 72.73972257160996
he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker’s one sleety day	 206.88568114790732
during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the	 30.774695673300833
wastepipe and the ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently	 27.41929368838519
he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in	 26.193089931976935
my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the	 32.37725135879937
information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant	 16.061783276314273
purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.	 16.833728914082492

SECOND WATCH: _(Produces handcuffs.)_ Here are the darbies.	 35.779163222852304
MRS BELLINGHAM: He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome	 37.14019831101913
compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my	 44.59432791565315
frostbound coachman Palmer while in the same breath he expressed	 53.847318246788575
himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his	 31.55594166616986
fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing	 90.48812483823279
my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon	 17.849510808906857
garnished sable, a buck’s head couped or. He lauded almost	 43.72513625658142
extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose	 34.64677807561585
drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden	 32.291925881693906
treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He	 41.00383739376545
urged me (Stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me.) to	 70.69151365294965
defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible	 42.45065957867383
opportunity.	 4.608171674364364
THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(In amazon costume, hard hat,	 25.49698766489978
jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets	 13.83598885576105
with braided drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she	 54.529656930174525
strikes her welt constantly.)_ Also me. Because he saw me on the polo	 74.61197247355462
ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of	 51.87275260874519
Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger	 43.13958953011381
Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob	 26.60306954326105
_Centaur._ This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car	 117.90769323864706
and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold	 116.21275892691783
after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still.	 108.1298927851476
It represents a partially nude señorita, frail and lovely (his wife, as	 40.18570208489927
he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit	 81.14430993072959
intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me	 14.528128953270338
to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He	 36.88973924378985
implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise	 95.49794288099041
him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most	 34.92994933145821
vicious horsewhipping.	 4.411654744205047
MRS BELLINGHAM: Me too.	 68.92055702906126

sudden paroxysm of fury.)_ I will, by the God above me. I’ll scourge	 139.93068051770814

alive.	 7205.946160518496
BLOOM: _(His eyes closing, quails expectantly.)_ Here? _(He squirms.)_	 33.09832017391448
Again! _(He pants cringing.)_ I love the danger.	 100.21571539428969
THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: Very much so! I’ll make it hot for	 36.41918279645076
you. I’ll make you dance Jack Latten for that.	 87.00728276020051

man!	 1155.5370950410265
BLOOM: All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm	 147.87315290172592
tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the	 20.52171134095867
circulation.	 4.608171674364364
THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(Laughs derisively.)_ O, did you,	 24.495885607594268
my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you’ll get the surprise of	 126.42142430280818
your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever	 177.05312722195305
bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into	 32.366307604712226
fury.	 21783.122115743052
MRS BELLINGHAM: _(Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.)_	 12.618264840310083
Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within	 126.22302976412331
an inch of his life. The cat-o’-nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.	 29.031538248764075
BLOOM: _(Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands: with hangdog mien.)_ O	 37.422383547120205
cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet.	 163.84409497944057
Let me off this once. _(He offers the other cheek.)_	 99.31054951453291
MRS YELVERTON BARRY: _(Severely.)_ Don’t do so on any account, Mrs	 133.09153569959082
Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!	 66.76268750761932
THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(Unbuttoning her gauntlet	 8.860565500681846
violently.)_ I’ll do no such thing. Pigdog and always was ever since he	 177.3437702690568
was pupped! To dare address me! I’ll flog him black and blue in the	 68.74240111446377
public streets. I’ll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a	 69.73581757783438

He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in	 37.688162549693885
consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a	 58.44141662883216
family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to	 76.46565036937389
be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal	 45.263254294558735
examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal,	 35.63305354840029
axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be _virgo	 12.685486044700323
intacta._	 4.608171674364364
_(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)_	 62.674235373706004
DR MADDEN: Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming	 93.6945173115753
generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in	 64.09810420770884
spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.	 165.26914722268805

DR DIXON: _(Reads a bill of health.)_ Professor Bloom is a finished	 170.48236910379762
example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable.	 81.97284628871117
Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint	 70.06958854346564
fellow on the whole, coy though not feebleminded in the medical sense.	 93.29982169296035
He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the	 59.43261139875561
court missionary of the Reformed Priests’ Protection Society which	 34.99503634413639
clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can	 34.71135514790419
affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food,	 45.348930460442574
cold dried grocer’s peas. He wears a hairshirt of pure Irish	 32.90705572016523
manufacture winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He	 44.50788901259885
was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree	 47.33540087881051
reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child.	 44.350006833575335
I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal	 34.80528709281767

hang a man’s hat and waterproof. Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing	 95.82682550542478
them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is	 74.1534047506049

halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head	 76.82751266265758
sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper	 64.42047574739425
dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies,	 42.86464451503218
colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of	 20.575556886830242
jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in	 14.20132749629705

morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage	 46.716259858116665
higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapestried with a paper of yewfronds	 26.2713402248091

coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of	 64.30581966269358
gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I	 73.87818499593934
should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always	 119.14228653478143
understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses	 52.002838023201676
of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity.	 28.476240866847068
In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?	 124.14859309627573
BLOOM: She is rather lean.	 163.55730471441842
VIRAG: _(Not unpleasantly.)_ Absolutely! Well observed and those	 139.6618790635761
pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to	 91.61974842119069
suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for	 180.3912075398765
which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye.	 29.12131065371871
Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you	 39.20204725716547
tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! _(With a nervous twitch of	 65.72207212996086
his head.)_ Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!	 75.16679067512698
BLOOM: _(An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.)_	 77.59181254251537
She seems sad.	 195.52104685671856
VIRAG: _(Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left	 98.60049439839082
eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.)_ Hoax! Beware of the flapper and	 36.015668628947274

_(More genially.)_ Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item	 55.180922908472844
number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe	 94.83576197020706
the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she	 59.026614521339525
bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.	 18.457603926083483
BLOOM: _(Regretfully.)_ When you come out without your gun.	 59.10618915733975
VIRAG: We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your	 94.80460659802307
money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...	 160.93465343820753
BLOOM: With...?	 67.69787394526536
VIRAG: _(His tongue upcurling.)_ Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is	 116.60345930163194
coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in	 20.563308752538457
weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two	 143.10279313142595
protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the	 65.58868407025427
noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional	 74.53969203099074
protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation,	 7.787814260944148
which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts	 151.52046655650963
are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers	 45.60968932419355
reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and	 56.216573326895706
gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during	 56.1773373089467
their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal	 47.002629560307966
blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker	 76.55408433754484
after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. _(His throat twitches.)_ Slapbang!	 29.576703752551516
There he goes again.	 87.55060042449423
BLOOM: The stye I dislike.	 96.3217637707811

It is a funny sound. _(He coughs encouragingly.)_ But possibly it is	 48.02434813325932
only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have	 58.17784857744522
taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.	 81.6650358489858
BLOOM: _(Reflecting.)_ Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This	 16.979836053275886

accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said...	 72.22407325814565
VIRAG: _(Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.)_ Stop	 72.60969473227541
twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have	 64.38033341185104
forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. _La causa è santa_. Tara. Tara.	 34.07651388984762
_(Aside.)_ He will surely remember.	 409.9772788335784
BLOOM: Rosemary also did I understand you to say or willpower over	 58.249740606525734
parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a	 82.11360141745405

VIRAG: _(Excitedly.)_ I say so. I say so. E’en so. Technic. _(He taps	 39.61134057659626
his parchmentroll energetically.)_ This book tells you how to act with	 84.98540849913395

Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue	 33.692271692648035

like or dislike women in male habiliments? _(With a dry snigger.)_ You	 104.02601173993072

BLOOM: I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence	 92.87876106769379
this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is	 143.64546576520442

coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a	 51.87497193010002
scooping hand.)_ You shall find that these night insects follow the	 154.445564163598

speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before	 42.93160872065368
the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and	 37.364598911968024

a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family.	 46.2736848772738
Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed	 74.84299857633681

I’ll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son.	 103.1902594065031

KITTY: Don’t be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won’t, ma’amsir.	 177.28915920216085
BELLO: _(Coaxingly.)_ Come, ducky dear, I want a word with you,	 90.07053751361033
darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart	 114.52119807015342
talk, sweety. _(Bloom puts out her timid head.)_ There’s a good girly	 92.27887092387674
now. _(Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.)_ I only	 97.55123493899929
want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How’s that	 76.68175680652988
tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.	 95.61142749031491
BLOOM: _(Fainting.)_ Don’t tear my...	 63.31840764907899
BELLO: _(Savagely.)_ The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the	 15.461301919351415
hanging hook, the knout I’ll make you kiss while the flutes play like	 89.79007292843995
the Nubian slave of old. You’re in for it this time! I’ll make you	 49.634319476772035
remember me for the balance of your natural life. _(His forehead veins	 105.77095022138847
swollen, his face congested.)_ I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback	 49.50472113526527

from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and	 44.15439759466208
lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you. _(He twists her arm. Bloom	 109.57572969389992

BLOOM: _(Goaded, buttocksmothered.)_ O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!	 54.445425948263576
BELLO: Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg. Pray for it as you never	 115.87279708461017
prayed before. _(He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.)_ Here,	 137.64802180214846
kiss that. Both. Kiss. _(He throws a leg astride and, pressing with	 86.27880689275374
horseman’s knees, calls in a hard voice.)_ Gee up! A cockhorse to	 71.74820914381304

Off we pop! I’ll nurse you in proper fashion. _(He horserides	 80.42479401449825

thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your	 48.05007113224398

wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven	 6.0951981874809755

whalebone busk to the diamondtrimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge,	 14.590901872974177

you...	 149.54238275787918
BLOOM: _(A charming soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and large	 45.33610142164896
male hands and nose, leering mouth.)_ I tried her things on only twice,	 270.30640779458196
a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hard up I washed them to	 39.35479881040348

to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High	 33.744595783843856
School play _Vice Versa_. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink,	 55.73877376270528

and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.	 37.08846752469288

took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on	 74.93670239782708
the smoothworn throne.	 54.47975467064285
BLOOM: Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy.	 94.29923869016115
_(Earnestly.)_ And really it’s better the position... because often I	 288.61181471317747
used to wet...	 145.58524186617223
BELLO: _(Sternly.)_ No insubordination! The sawdust is there in the	 37.57389508625336
corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn’t I? Do it	 71.88417518583209
standing, sir! I’ll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a	 50.30154130588229
trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you’ll find I’m a	 48.83266140955041
martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.	 106.01612715829042
THE SINS OF THE PAST: _(In a medley of voices.)_ He went through a form	 37.072842612007584
of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the	 75.82899821503895
Black church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn	 42.985005527587994
at an address in D’Olier street while he presented himself indecently	 70.89809179862347
to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he frankly	 37.892889637668254
encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an	 21.10823281148198
unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public	 43.554782974441956
conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner	 12.946171646602727
to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol	 76.50937562695543
works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to	 116.45257406827662
see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the	 85.57063677107978
gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper	 15.091346944321531
presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a	 21.93552146298379
postal order?	 101.99760060768644

BELLO: You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in	 108.3151273355561
the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh’s the cook’s, a sandy one.	 47.55524191697257
Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like	 121.77242668686958
champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! You will dance attendance or I’ll	 92.8994540686749
lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right	 73.56230165408708
well, miss, with the hairbrush. You’ll be taught the error of your	 52.28952020093706
ways. At night your wellcreamed braceletted hands will wear	 213.93269698727005
fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately	 31.76969730023738
scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their	 140.15879470430522
lives. _(He chuckles.)_ My boys will be no end charmed to see you so	 69.77279326756742
ladylike, the colonel, above all, when they come here the night before	 84.325534677493
the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First I’ll	 101.9428372486659
have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta	 104.69798540733296
Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the	 46.18947419757057
Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work	 58.78832393182162
at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers?	 147.4787136315572
_(He points.)_ For that lot. Trained by owner to fetch and carry,	 44.602558939754175
basket in mouth. _(He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom’s	 58.150730741778446

THE LACQUEY: Barang!	 46.303401141700704
A VOICE: One and eightpence too much.	 33.752431641085224
CHARLES ALBERTA MARSH: Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.	 146.05553117657598
BELLO: _(Gives a rap with his gavel.)_ Two bar. Rockbottom figure and	 43.73309324172099
cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine shis points.	 184.02665474253786
Handle hrim. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If	 288.3699620204289
I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid	 169.03814993867942
gallons a day. A pure stockgetter, due to lay within the hour. His	 95.375212252142
sire’s milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks.	 66.91738288729117
Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! _(He brands his initial C on Bloom’s	 56.97564166822768

VOICES: _(Subdued.)_ For the Caliph. Haroun Al Raschid.	 16.507217551389108
BELLO: _(Gaily.)_ Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short	 117.54063880399497
skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a	 73.71984089060608
potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long	 57.641813349071754
straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better	 214.83247582442291
instincts of the _blasé_ man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk	 64.40632086940727
on four inch Louis Quinze heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup,	 98.80278424086538
the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your powers of	 101.88473219764028

BLOOM: _(Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with	 42.630741756953086
forefinger in mouth.)_ O, I know what you’re hinting at now!	 192.1674873563429
BELLO: What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? _(He	 64.87470347454499
stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suet folds	 40.23414792950679
of Bloom’s haunches.)_ Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where’s	 211.4612066350086
your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing,	 98.20552947845358
birdy, sing. It’s as limp as a boy of six’s doing his pooly behind a	 93.10041749908463
cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. _(Loudly.)_ Can you do a man’s	 122.89396958324856
job?	 4694.591780617159
BLOOM: Eccles street...	 27.289236895779847
BELLO: _(Sarcastically.)_ I wouldn’t hurt your feelings for the world	 48.175702102065
but there’s a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned,	 77.11588656114316
my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well	 59.35601795670788
for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and	 58.321190576363385
warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee	 63.62529839434632
to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He’s no eunuch. A shock of red	 205.22622756842597
hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine	 89.21931061746574
months, my lad! Holy ginger, it’s kicking and coughing up and down in	 154.25385179001702
her guts already! That makes you wild, don’t it? Touches the spot? _(He	 153.71641268279916
spits in contempt.)_ Spittoon!	 7.465625312670333
BLOOM: I was indecently treated, I... Inform the police. Hundred	 66.86246188697338
pounds. Unmentionable. I...	 235.86885024194063
BELLO: Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want not your	 116.9670900938794
drizzle.	 4.608171674364364
BLOOM: To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll... We... Still...	 169.21232524977822
BELLO: _(Ruthlessly.)_ No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman’s	 124.55886411221678

BLOOM: _(In tattered mocassins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tiptoeing,	 20.342429476592567
fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the	 16.555235017860625
diamond panes, cries out.)_ I see her! It’s she! The first night at Mat	 159.7995296841211

_(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her blue scarf	 35.55699812656066

calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)_	 90.72269154083895
MILLY: My! It’s Papli! But, O Papli, how old you’ve grown!	 167.65170805995257
BELLO: Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writingtable where we never wrote,	 123.5956658136396
aunt Hegarty’s armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and	 44.88553093813032
his menfriends are living there in clover. The _Cuckoos’ Rest!_ Why	 59.475510207230954
not? How many women had you, eh, following them up dark streets,	 115.67836343238027
flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts, what, you male	 53.437411576295965
prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about.	 80.03307668153656
Sauce for the goose, my gander O.	 159.3212117962597
BLOOM: They... I...	 534.9827535634387
BELLO: _(Cuttingly.)_ Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet	 47.008115925292074
you bought at Wren’s auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to	 54.92250377380558
find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue	 108.31400553484058
you carried home in the rain for art for art’s sake. They will violate	 66.45647942834422
the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your	 57.39551601828983
handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in	 19.670058706612334
your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom’s.	 63.561655360704414
BLOOM: Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will	 100.17873050435884
return. I will prove...	 164.16720234161204
A VOICE: Swear!	 37.748225071202135
_(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowieknife between his	 21.996414203884857
teeth.)_	 9134.100938964017
BELLO: As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your	 68.03446823112702
secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You	 84.68900225794366
are down and out and don’t you forget it, old bean.	 71.45787395800102
BLOOM: Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody...? _(He bites his	 77.55936725144971
thumb.)_	 18873.26977590499
BELLO: Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or	 39.05507408749622
grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that’ll send you	 85.82140293206442
skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have!	 79.34244337159747
If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We’ll bury	 45.91832806307424
you in our shrubbery jakes where you’ll be dead and dirty with old Cuck	 70.93214171583296
Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and	 30.469793284982345
sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands,	 34.89880225888193
whatever the buggers’ names were, suffocated in the one cesspool. _(He	 63.107696103484834
explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.)_ We’ll manure you, Mr Flower! _(He	 62.50459433739138
pipes scoffingly.)_ Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!	 54.519747383424836

_(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to	 89.44008357945695

VOICES: _(Sighing.)_ So he’s gone. Ah yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never	 90.4092428183167
heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There’s the widow. That so? Ah,	 143.84838122438543
yes.	 220.63927910459736
_(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of	 10.161508559625377
incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oakframe a nymph with	 61.90665460214744
hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown artcolours, descends from her	 37.67860034493066
grotto and passing under interlacing yews stands over Bloom.)_	 105.74985131916962

THE NYMPH: _(Softly.)_ Mortal! _(Kindly.)_ Nay, dost not weepest!	 33.597787588311526
BLOOM: _(Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight,	 23.277530886575313
with dignity.)_ This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of	 67.90791329662945
habit.	 10338.868587270563
THE NYMPH: Mortal! You found me in evil company, highkickers, coster	 31.938091267634896
picnicmakers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in	 27.046255434616626
fleshtights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical	 17.415135361044026
act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that	 118.26084020904999
smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen,	 33.912474802511014
stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice	 29.594178756302895
and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with	 63.19955255694303
testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.	 39.78855785533931

THE NYMPH: _(Sadly.)_ Rubber goods. Neverrip brand as supplied to the	 25.640734495776847
aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded.	 56.89006038956206

Rublin with photo.	 59.16995392502629
BLOOM: You mean _Photo Bits?_	 99.5879463562728
THE NYMPH: I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me	 43.34563715645276
above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in	 53.83502581952185
four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my	 117.17805575229251
shame.	 8899.828281478898
BLOOM: _(Humbly kisses her long hair.)_ Your classic curves, beautiful	 148.94041454708054

almost to pray.	 1381.2212930596972
THE NYMPH: During dark nights I heard your praise.	 77.04722432295631
BLOOM: _(Quickly.)_ Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the	 92.09558174909432
worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of	 82.56417505099104
bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the	 154.0333363621197
rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some	 82.04602135827736
days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless,	 68.85355690736425
inoffensive vent. _(He sighs.)_ ’Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is	 105.91007274434492
marriage.	 9865.069418992227
THE NYMPH: _(Her fingers in her ears.)_ And words. They are not in my	 66.42047577506851
dictionary.	 4.608171674364364
BLOOM: You understood them?	 73.57662304354706
THE YEWS: Ssh!	 36.67871771856905
THE NYMPH: _(Covers her face with her hands.)_ What have I not seen in	 50.39110135976077
that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?	 177.9983873740073
BLOOM: _(Apologetically.)_ I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up	 59.712959930158156
with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea long ago.	 75.90333921556653
THE NYMPH: _(Bends her head.)_ Worse, worse!	 44.17684461850286
BLOOM: _(Reflects precautiously.)_ That antiquated commode. It wasn’t	 21.398927829335538
her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds	 93.80604319338444
after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd	 82.85562095834909
orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.	 50.04942722454107

instinct of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice),	 32.251922967684024
even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were	 60.10612129171314
