every body was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment	 261.85523002179684

very true and if i had my will we should but my dear lydia i dont	 393.37911552901903
mrs bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain	 37.45379291746267
pardon for having displeased her in a softened tone she declared	 198.22754706344466
of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express	 760.9005775033007
what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the	 103.02510630105007
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjustany thing that spoke him	 292.62367896832353
was not in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it in	 187.5423663070602
a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by	 706.5440601239691
my dear mr bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard that	 388.21130762311634
an attachment	 19.529293471521495
about its relative situation let our first effusions be less	 1309.8700657949507
after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows	 115.71485364882822
married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider	 1384.1144004780822
her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana	 38.392402816249245
but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that	 116.81945071136371
little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the	 60.538089845846656
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from	 57.90677147085313
such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to	 241.4121314967067
she admired him	 3.984039538001739
wickhams affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to	 590.1087367384864
seemed to imply it could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts	 181.27433517523673
suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly to	 394.6927320366739
this was a sad omen of what her mothers behaviour to the gentleman	 44.389060593479996
them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are	 529.2311202804343

that you certainly shall	 93.8762877834961
yes i do comprehend a great deal in it	 62.773272716838
elizabeths spirits were so high on the occasion that though she did	 181.6861079762008
back a supply of clothes	 1295.5587666863983
in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow	 36.299356488804946

it is enough to know they are discovered i have seen them	 129.29932836478287
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion at that instant she felt	 26.50115846669089

ready to think your own children silly if i wished to think slightingly	 436.20124840517906
she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages	 117.58375517676927
true it will be wise in me to refrain from that but do not imagine	 183.2153017702601
symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the	 146.37119070617155
them ill	 85.93829475297956

and anxious attention while she added	 144.92245288893616
you write uncommonly fast	 94.5889264756814
quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr darcy	 33.735703235269206
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience	 60.00652721456652
is nothing like dancing after alli consider it as one of the first	 183.58356958652826

father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a	 255.56553976549344
resentments of his having an unforgiving temper his disposition must	 244.26672825606022
disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate there	 102.9221858982608
kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours	 455.1978471230449
were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy	 820.7983901265968
as janes	 80.47188715258302

them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report	 305.49736718407996
elizabeth asked questions in vain maria would tell her nothing more	 412.7152696061156
there was certainly at this moment in elizabeths mind a more gentle	 418.99200033927644
being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud	 382.76843386914965
had a great deal of talk together they met again on sunday and	 302.98624814206164
hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the rest of	 523.0312472605565
many girls and what sort of young lady is she is she handsome	 1971.7731730878093
engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many	 700.3511996132985

how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the	 299.76369222474307

no no you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i	 808.6433305094423
greatness before him and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh	 67.50908754763677
mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of	 57.715850663071656

of usual cheerfulness but with no farther attempt to distinguish	 376.59856620438126
lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr darcy drawing near	 716.2666541607584
and trust he will excuse my not having done it before my total	 504.3156150981928

should make their appearance at st jamess the whole family in short	 405.65600953822394

of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on	 1111.793934151511
enquiries which she very early received from mr bingley by a housemaid	 336.2336287186333
on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the	 9.874736947721207

to learn more about the project gutenberg literary archive foundation	 13.817178869307478
particulars but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to	 89.26423960687268
i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his	 328.3667808816931
with it and was confident at last that she recollected having heard	 144.55333599239782
income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in	 41.22158560139687
gracefully elizabeth went away with her head full of him she could	 403.1152943243715

such boundless influence that he had been concerned in the measures	 38.34125692210773
minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to	 87.10229681225535

his sisters would be successful in keeping him away unwilling as she	 174.10642438877113
perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had	 192.1250288277849
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she	 795.0292899395546
an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to	 489.9331520813133
always exceed your income	 15.505688176979552
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and	 40.862893719466015
but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her	 110.48273361175008
turned away with a degree of ill humour which she could not wholly	 194.16379907808218
discover them but he had something to direct his search which was	 63.47649084163794
thought it would be very good fun if i was	 13.807086240623613
darcy it was a rational scheme to be sure but from what the report of	 414.74993274189626
easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance she was very	 316.08129429930807
aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable	 326.0587609623335
having somebody at his disposal i wonder he does not marry to secure a	 166.1421085517007
seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent	 1348.9208860803653
the country said darcy can in general supply but few subjects for	 425.91772638737723
work you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1e<NUMBER>	 93.96382465240279
written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by mr darcy	 527.5000181616568
there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the	 172.38280907132204
make an offer to me	 92.2251781643832
were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined	 68.75424111143609
and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and	 312.9237155370358
possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every	 138.67799838589173
of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some	 159.46848284843026
your examination of mr darcy is over i presume said miss	 47.960610757723664
in the diningroom they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been	 110.38067694085545
she had condemned and upbraided him her anger was turned against	 135.3872922239185
were speaking of just now	 337.2305549051557
i did not know before that you ever walked this way	 48.57960523878364
pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the	 420.2974273894132
taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes	 1253.0106472490952
the possibility of mr collinss fancying himself in love with her	 96.6206309077441
accept the honour of their invitation c mrs bennet was quite	 1021.8097268102448
colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of	 207.9852408282866
then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added	 117.80891428884635
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added how long did you	 165.4847232740102
make a most important discovery	 19.48118523875183
must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was	 137.15947176305724
unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimed	 10.695427631867359
fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as	 1976.2923943285628
i hope my dear said mr bennet to his wife as they were at	 44.8093590862147
you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this i see	 114.5831875852318
confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running up	 109.73311151319012
civilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a	 177.02346104178582
various creditors of mr wickham in and near brighton with	 99.12231480630169
many months ago from mr wickham on this subject what can you have to	 911.1124177130844
charms	 1.9356690691114107
your first position is false they may wish many things besides his	 334.81507943899805
these are not janes feelings she is not acting by design as yet she	 422.2852935644272
weighty accusation of having injured mr wickham i can only	 35.01948371656406
and completely do for us at once good heaven brighton and a whole	 639.2216076367126
done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlottes	 220.48271133420343
might in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbers	 630.8725462257075
philosophic composure he said as little as he had ever been in the	 133.67635525853672
be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of	 121.08232845844478
lady catherine how wonderfully these sort of things occur who would	 433.38322480598225
some who are able and willing to assist him in the army he has the	 96.22064109628714
but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their own	 118.60851376219283
darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for	 86.81526342141068
satisfy mr collins and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyships	 436.7919118779504
only once with mrs hurst and once with miss bingley declined being	 494.7201553596803
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said	 739.9248020883525
mentioned colonel fitzwilliams and mr darcys having both spent three	 980.7627104811208
mr darcy who was leaning against the mantlepiece with his eyes fixed	 49.21862109062338
neglect such an acquaintance well how pleased i am and it is such a	 192.34935514305084
being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured	 112.6575358290082
elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol	 28.939351448769045
making any answer she went on as before	 600.1114401767373
they would not offer to send her home	 558.4682371079937
monday endurable to kitty and lydia	 27.995530817283793
myself how can you be so teazing	 22.79218434856324
they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to	 118.03706402718811
end without a quarrel come as soon as you can on the receipt of	 302.82166496127115
without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable	 225.97583736023554
receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost	 585.8149568124943
elizabeth looked surprised the gentleman experienced some change of	 510.0495691188992
yourself and mrs bennet i am inclined to think that her own	 35.74250205483899
opportunities to fix the problem	 2.714743574152372
fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was	 202.5640663660545
when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which	 331.46653079171097
had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as	 1000.879358982174
importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience	 172.8432271039919
learnt to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted her	 616.6098660543532
not speak another word darcy in wretched suspense could only say	 758.5914948020528
elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the	 161.82209584634342
was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil but i have	 103.12924303221334
begin freelya slight preference is natural enough but there are	 2168.7174395967872
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a	 833.5640140467655
ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself she	 1458.1551626451514
bingleys regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence	 35.42670713945959
i saw you look at me today lizzy when my aunt told us of the present	 620.9671976252328
your uncle has laid down to bring it about and the other how i am	 810.8982284367326
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at	 83.83109238611895
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour	 68.8427880512189
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests darcy said	 506.351170000978
considering the event shews some greatness of mind	 82.64582472096542
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence	 427.23289433952726
very well we now come to the point your mother insists upon your	 391.75719255070146
i have not a doubt of mr bingleys sincerity said elizabeth warmly	 19.896916521498778
of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so	 732.0661099213761
conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself	 17.297864778288027
experienced many hardships of that nature but in matters of greater	 99.65650467468174

persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering	 132.54364397255787

yes all of them i think they all paint tables cover skreens and net	 52.95049552277275
preference which was often given me	 63.14685617104901
that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be	 221.8661528069288
has often said so and envied me janes beauty i do not like to boast	 540.7060347924338
animal spirits and a sort of natural selfconsequence which the	 230.00152289522333
being soon married her joy burst forth and every following sentence	 1445.420716201286
good and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered	 249.2554959620974
wife but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true	 301.74092006568344
yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight do	 677.1850592131049
marry you but when you have had time to think it all over i hope you	 504.3584752047608
was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have	 398.98915429074793
wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of	 317.1521177737354
before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the	 44.47414979946183
good good news to my sister philips and as i come back i can call on	 1555.3010720747045
temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydias example she	 338.9901705143583
her which he could not help flattering himself however might be	 69.50882749529764
arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe	 52.852970674606475
must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget	 1038.6240260409113
certainly sirand it has the advantage also of being in vogue	 443.6052582312908
it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon	 553.4968956523553
is this thought elizabeth meant for me and she coloured at the	 264.7212663099444
lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added	 207.50386446828236
out like his information	 264.7002858066352
mr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunts ill breeding and made	 288.08009317259916
always very short those to her mother contained little else than that	 1003.4664250215428
own words so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to	 309.09494086206627
reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon	 107.54739743210364
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you	 73.5411031726998
the exertion would soon have been nothing one ought not to	 223.22486287286156
therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that	 648.3712850385808
humility it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an	 610.2929692717396
catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman for	 149.30548162640858
