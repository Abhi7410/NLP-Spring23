a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side	 38.13479703856727
the neighbourhood	 3.526530980794726
elizabeth on her side had much to do she wanted to ascertain the	 244.56287253163467
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement there are a few	 154.45717069112513
oh jane cried elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it who	 919.2886394187724
or charges if you are redistributing or providing access to a work	 64.2588795062161
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as	 1119.0837959086234
body too who is likely to know	 236.33573447189156
was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one	 1590.5969271775762
provided in paragraph 1f3 you agree that the foundation the	 16.17657767392145
confirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of what	 5.779709305555154
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe how can you be smiling so	 42.36360296906748
politeness there was good humour and kindnessmr darcy said very	 953.9706853250851
a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by	 702.0769602171529
minutes in which they continued together were some of the most	 288.3578108838995
only fond of this young mans society whose manners were always	 1196.6172857472875

her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who	 530.0901166205522
cost sir lewis de bourgh	 9.27815074429475
extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her	 411.7607045109783
far as to exclude me from p i shall never be quite happy till i	 115.39777768884652
they have been intended for each other it was the favourite wish of	 466.19235532200145
him was ecstacy	 12.918519223656997
merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he	 818.9175210481224
their party in the diningroom was large for almost all the lucases	 302.1972885845506
had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with	 455.79532815972624
his regiment at the end of a fortnight	 80.94538850497008
would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone elizabeth blushed	 223.43357137773515
could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other	 124.31855882320605
representation of all this might make me quite easy but i know the	 298.00694454702085
mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisters proficiency	 176.10769146946535
you begin said she i can comprehend your going on charmingly when	 236.3349523519936
they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was	 138.35072623252483
disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some	 510.2541862628978
jane looked at her doubtingly oh lizzy it cannot be i know how much	 264.8123032608102
unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it	 93.31843084703412
astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of	 608.0437609150194
a beautyi should as soon call her mother a wit but afterwards she	 1246.0208728098603
for good news the letter was read aloud mrs bennet could hardly	 329.45865377498455
there were other evils before her she anticipated what would be felt in	 105.00564173817325
objection all loveliness and goodness as she is her understanding	 41.81613039485644
circumstances	 95.32733073767436
my frankness to believe me capable of that after abusing you so	 163.59304631003968
with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not	 320.1719033836873
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours	 389.71958665511227
agreeable he would have talked to mrs long but i can guess how it was	 395.2451878351502
all took place miss bingleys civility to elizabeth increased at last	 520.9081201741344
the charge of her but i was overruled as i always am poor dear	 451.6224551250477
attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause	 699.8342615587425
laugh as much as you chuse but you will not laugh me out of my	 260.5168182047774
spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as	 30.53150325053061
and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of	 451.18496633431926
otherwise explained	 59.929402932094305
that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from	 615.2214821195473
retailing them all to the younger miss lucases and lydia in a voice	 241.53806859569934
seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much	 250.44383424743876
those points where he most wants care from something that he told me in	 1304.3173257365943
door he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to any one else	 444.7787567045653
meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country let wickham	 129.89501382563728
at netherfield at last she did indeed i do think mrs long is as good	 713.9811038992968
well thensupposing them to be in london they may be there though	 190.62039840979173
elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this	 87.2328215022049
upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get	 255.11681052104794
report is spread abroad	 41.341781393158136
that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the	 708.3021261592412
independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in	 65.79860639532012
good natured a girl as ever lived i will go directly to mr bennet and	 363.21093661991665
it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your	 186.97693905651764
stronglymarked features which might once have been handsome her air	 287.83971004592394
where a few books were lying he immediately offered to fetch her	 211.57135018883167
who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an	 1450.5390748507737
waterplant there chanced to be a little alteration it originated in	 25.824816504669442
i hope added mrs gardiner that no consideration with regard to	 496.64758255597945
confusion lest they had been overheard	 5.263417576452424
playful disposition which delighted in any thing ridiculous	 127.18762303040748
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew	 256.4949324757954
prove what she felt	 15.260946170928895
rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning there was a	 190.22708952907402
to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certain true he	 321.9809437053148
why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she	 489.68066671013065
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy and	 98.85860176432492
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother	 31.54586555519494
them in the course of the day but mrs bennet who had calculated on	 26.223571662753468
copying and distributing project gutenbergtm electronic works to	 18.5364837569444
wished to learn never wanted the means we were always encouraged to	 224.62324462414415
elizabeth shook her head over this letter it convinced her that	 215.8253171090677
1813	 1.962759145445629
in general satisfactory mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor	 253.86904552603838
continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the groupand i doubt	 897.9637518786869
section 1 general terms of use and redistributing project gutenbergtm	 77.11362770432964
in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to	 12.612702522025069
which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the	 471.703317325699
great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen	 263.5527458008359
by all means my good qualities are under your protection and you are	 98.08609636260545
successful love for mrs bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule	 167.07672996186255
i believe she didand i am sure she could not have bestowed her	 27.651565513475326
not for the entail i should not mind it	 34.81417034526956
they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the	 564.8977649121031
the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one	 1049.8611710014125
to a milliners shop just over the way the two youngest of the family	 102.9999751848678
spoke she would have quitted the room had not mr collins thus	 434.1796352115623
assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be	 108.59858728694863
influencing his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been	 540.9330652526538
siryou will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching	 143.99502371259803
events mr wickham wrote to inform me that having finally	 172.53525816856265
janes steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable	 419.01216802266384
some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn	 130.30497130851722
with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling your	 375.40684359666636
were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his	 367.5673599077093
year letters of business too how odious i should think them	 1196.8304265293168
useless for of course they were to have a son this son was to join	 416.38940211711883
parsonage i should not think any one abiding in it an object of	 270.292293941976
idea of an accomplished woman	 59.596705066228296
were particularly intimate sir william lucas had been formerly in trade	 87.7604417369212
her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been	 1005.2046840851322
except thought elizabeth when she goes to ramsgate	 58.71114429410577
had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty	 132.31442354528264
sake turning to charlotte i am glad of it but otherwise i see no	 1041.1554723894856
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with	 597.7201575752838
consequent explanations	 2.1555682567671157
in spite of having been at st jamess sir william was so completely	 133.4924584018034
delight but we considered it we talked of it as impossible and do you	 441.0072065823954
supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which	 91.5282846416986
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready	 993.9157198814117
seeing him till after the departure of the former he did not	 113.11019703975646
sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeableallowing	 13.137454040548688
coming here i had no notion but he would go a shooting or something or	 460.763361149734
thing she ever did she seems perfectly happy however and in a	 494.76434506539005
scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under	 237.0375770747926
were indisposed maria thought speaking out of the question and the	 373.665424310633
could from such disgraceful companions that he was surprised by the	 121.14758550364769
would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november	 300.4871004563208
soon after this event	 81.5523531803508
derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world	 299.4736079849727
reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own	 544.1805112680039
but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow if i can	 495.8090696975548
cambric and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders had	 179.42065039983936
place as soon as possible which he trusted would be an unanswerable	 126.06408480781846
how strange cried elizabeth how abominablei wonder that the very	 332.2287219221948
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing	 102.70945230291409
mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of	 84.73256222254098
setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again	 293.12856299236205
a conceited pompous narrowminded silly man you know he is as well	 221.3575586987941
apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments	 148.43364463234013
should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but	 274.05464987135343
but self though it would intrude could not engross her lydiathe	 49.6349320651954
he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while	 492.8379648958177
returning to the carriage as quickly as possible her niece was	 215.37077422960647
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield the visit	 479.5778755954037
aye that is just like your formality and discretion you thought the	 189.03267660950453
what jane felt for bingley her astonishment at his comingat his	 368.2060926091754
alarms being now removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of	 89.7853784227058
down stairs herself on entering the drawingroom she found the whole	 354.13283739347247
with such justice i am happier even than jane she only smiles i	 687.0848532234373
such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than mrs	 97.96562907603811
sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth	 277.20187928599563
opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song	 51.597594782810475
must deaden them more mr darcys behaviour astonished and vexed her	 145.36241048264645
trademark owner and any distributor under this agreement will not be	 46.20072323659448
last incumbrance of mystery and then said she if that very	 107.236822973423
think necessary and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with	 352.39559353706755
his reliance on mine made every thing easy i was obliged to confess	 1503.556033706064
to london i was right therefore my last letter had never reached her	 1674.7346194356523
she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the	 185.20936287018088
at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of	 149.26948222997214
tired and they stood together on the lawn at such a time much might	 105.17290333092927
this was a lucky idea of mine indeed said mrs bennet more than	 298.53547461680733
with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to	 770.6339571825017
sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks though her manner	 498.4262815328829
as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in	 307.71057220504247
had gained their own room jane taking out the letter said	 371.2897305900643
were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers	 99.67684618602496
attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation	 153.20342656522192
welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble	 37.337640849445066
till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him	 35.79533257002584
drew back and said with some discomposure to sir william	 148.06073504999677
i have heard much of your masters fine person said mrs gardiner	 92.22013502317235
invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had	 103.80681024131754
agreeable but elizabeth less clearsighted perhaps in his case than	 1132.1924400511705
i am far from attributing any part of mr bingleys conduct to design	 255.06870548852424
decease is all that you may ever be entitled to on that head	 164.86222447026736
one i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady	 214.6279226990013
pay	 1.962759145445629
known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love	 1543.8925191394399
animated mrs collins knew not what to make of him colonel	 331.6463567475395
on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost	 691.9215207213258
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run	 92.11351306217524
took place	 14.971419373582641
sir william remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelings	 386.1661456816393
individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor	 109.45785901449428
my part mr bingley i always keep servants that can do their own	 788.2595273835487
connected with the letter he held it suddenly struck her that it might	 423.29109537112356
of her life	 13.38833233117677
mr bingley followed his advice mr darcy walked off and elizabeth	 384.1759949355783
possible that he will marry her	 109.72810920524739
however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively	 825.1933308685774
chance in the world of her ever getting him now there is no talk of his	 597.3636087767683
fastidious and his manners though well bred were not inviting in	 59.04261187932477
brother gardiners in town so much in love with her that my	 122.0545053585645
for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he	 609.2291591226825

time make their past imprudence forgotten	 701.2021235051653
to driving him out in his gig and shewing him the country but when he	 118.85085695655009

what he was had i but explained some part of it onlysome part of what	 205.77517564710632
strange	 1.962759145445629
when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject it	 1567.8540698654483
objected to be kept waiting for her dinnersuch formidable accounts of	 18.9245272780065
have been quite a slave to your education	 64.07099269308195
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little	 907.859169069076
what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of every thing	 96.83824327483536
little except in a low voice to mrs jenkinson in whose appearance	 378.7934062546404

her which he could not help flattering himself however might be	 69.2970319354947

instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the	 385.071298735505
temper she could not contribute much to my felicity	 311.9184008565203

out that mrs collinss joints of meat were too large for her family	 347.6909503023876
her sister made not the smallest objection and the pianoforte was	 19.287047511780806

you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first	 873.6134725677337

my dearest love tell me what dish mr darcy is particularly fond of	 329.42834863594703
drawingroom and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decent	 137.2097690507107
and she would at times have given any thing to be privileged to tell	 121.06860329360192
acquaintance	 3.7792881394141014
must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them	 124.85876987345969
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but	 606.4597322474269
if he does not come to me then said she i shall give him up for	 297.6676899411858
first circles allow me to say however that your fair partner does not	 483.07787538234396

assure you it is much larger than sir william lucass	 83.2275707341992

went to see him he should marry one of my daughters but it ended in	 422.6232730497362
neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we	 556.3911707954061

conversation with the ladies and sir william to elizabeths high	 397.63107587480795
for heavens sake madam speak lowerwhat advantage can it be to you	 353.3321449258044

would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour	 191.37256230910822
while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the	 32.911508848260105
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless	 234.53398691974488
that it ought not to be attempted mr darcy has not authorised me to	 35.85643062701943
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when	 145.80964310547517
wickham immediately to elizabeths mind and from the observation of the	 406.52892048732963
with while sir william was with them mr collins devoted his mornings	 156.0558127327063
i do assure you sir that i have no pretension whatever to that kind	 299.9892778887847
herselfthat could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost	 435.4344028954026
rather taller	 3.7996318652331116
mr collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he	 444.1656410333641
memories than that their brothers fortune and their own had been	 424.88333003911885
seen riding down the street on distinguishing the ladies of the group	 48.803117842056054
i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy	 390.64219224452813
elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to	 226.97934386601816
they had never seen before of most gentlemanlike appearance walking	 301.6103454476555
been in an error your superior knowledge of your sister must make	 352.3189189557493
staid so long that even bingleys good humour was overcome and he	 256.4012952559186
inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such	 83.05246351256673
every moment should be employed in conversing together jane should	 411.4396297526043
and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be	 1099.6910767660306
could be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they	 310.74050535632955
looked at jane and smiled and shook her head by turns	 162.55039984635906
we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire	 179.10889363260878
can have induced him to behave so cruelly	 17.23293555393099
to such perseverance in wilful selfdeception elizabeth would make no	 174.4274957948803
character and ideas between us we seem to have been designed for each	 292.8413089489375
amongst the less polished societies of the worldevery savage can	 56.89585524718989
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects but when they see	 153.27543793836978
depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both	 130.3999482001597
better looking it is what every body says i do not trust my own	 769.1396668692751
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he	 37.24667934211538
forster i thought i should have died and that made the men suspect	 154.09771754910028
it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said	 328.86370870068237
notice the two first dances however brought a return of distress	 777.0983237262483
disgrace	 1.962759145445629
the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable	 10.407518519617796
hand but in vain elizabeth was determined nor did sir william at all	 1000.397843829953
however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually	 176.9477144168288
paid she had no knowledge of it it was then disclosed in the following	 294.5722027486715
was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased	 381.92625851253143
establishment were gained	 3.2634503429918946
charge for the ebooks unless you receive specific permission if you	 1021.5109317599902
feel on his behalf is natural and amiable i cannot but wonder	 818.1201078819249
nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his	 786.9034682403886
likely to make her more elegant elizabeth did all she could to shield	 318.8285588600653
that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her	 526.6063539806495
minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion she	 253.50369890769323
is not this nice is not this an agreeable surprise	 545.9515704440909
is a shade in a character but you have chosen your fault welli	 52.31482830886113
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again the promised	 872.3725516841389
neither manner nor sense to recommend him stupid men are the only ones	 698.8302252242785
she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of	 772.931129162086
good siryou had better neglect your relations than run the risk of	 143.80917750151792
bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant and the respect which he	 1024.9149425722396
vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for	 548.8229346648557
and what arts did he use to separate them	 67.95659444930904
particularly hurts me i will have no reserves from you mr darcy	 69.44535734996532
who seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiable	 915.7228263736461
gown and with her hair half finished crying out	 67.9650676012916
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on	 277.3260526837654
consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents	 75.29886077081055
but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal	 254.4544222626866
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever	 44.35746499695497
with believing that she would have been his only choice had fortune	 558.1674046382972
make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was	 263.29219281831166
about the house in restless ecstacy calling for every ones	 192.14765591702724
my motive for cautioning you is as follows we have reason to imagine	 765.2958584319114
from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally	 76.26912261605847
the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the	 361.4222953095096
had said enough to keep him quiet	 163.48979446316275
prevailed on to get out	 71.35000484036212
with his conduct she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear	 174.1215621799828
they were of course all intending to be surprised but their	 87.68935603704446
wedding need not be put off for mr darcy might have done as well	 502.7865199768791
my diligence and care send back your answer as soon as you can	 177.34558077463956
material a step without her ladyships concurrence	 71.20679431592396
corrupt data transcription errors a copyright or other intellectual	 5.35210038488275
know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his	 296.48499715131084
who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had she	 491.136895816722
there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment	 299.4774796589198
greaterwhat shall i call it susceptibility to her feelings which are	 65.94978990157148
on the following monday mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her	 135.0235921374132
lace upon mrs hursts gown	 38.57989161136837
intended	 114.19727645802551
have	 16.779460656315514
of all that she had heard it was not to be supposed that any other	 18.687530731884863
sometimes cold did january and february pass away march was to take	 746.3253822162688
other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good lydia has no	 389.2038111298709
be seen the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable	 155.51182898208356
prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate	 334.93470691673383
with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was	 123.08621410649341
hope though you have but a short lease	 185.7883455129765
she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued	 149.65114347949887
hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her	 89.56958227420546
of them talk fast enough and wickham who happened to sit near	 1223.5574489975052
for such a visit was delighted at her entrance she was not equal	 1229.3307308554097
lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking	 310.5072411589335
yes he had no engagement at all for tomorrow and her invitation was	 949.2461688528895
delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits mr	 123.15701113487607

his taste or his good manners	 470.25930505883235
<URL>	 3.007738882596694
turned to him and said	 6.660306203836299
prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished and their	 300.5747841132272
and avarice begin last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me	 506.0232661178919
i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask me as well as lydia	 875.5893335108908
appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings	 1195.6060589653725
he had been some time with mr gardiner who with two or three other	 273.8893578469811
leaving wickham she was sure they should be married some time or	 599.6922923670578
reserved disagreeable girl yet he knew to the contrary himself he	 741.9561005917503
it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should	 578.1391175066719
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the	 83.89484437950364
the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a	 95.4557265451662
and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt let me hear	 123.22268357894019
king and the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth with jane	 131.89743217092095
less interesting mode of attachment be that as it may she saw him go	 1460.6031398826938
aye there she comes continued mrs bennet looking as unconcerned	 376.2810767593481
and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though	 168.8754471311845
these visits she examined into their employments looked at their work	 481.19566403654625
me but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well	 143.16367220113847
he was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that	 180.507655158584
mrs gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked	 621.0039789097913
as you describe mr bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl	 526.4174469867166
she enquired after his sister but could do no more	 231.08950707290097
upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the	 170.22224343530536
quick in its execution he begged to know farther particulars of what he	 60.685585888416945
her no more but though the probability of the statement was admitted at	 65.59696094986806
sorry it went off but these things happen so often a young man such	 1740.2008592874317
or lady concerned in it deserved but at last your uncle was forced	 896.0595401424347
is less certain	 164.6239832544827
yes madam said mrs bennet delighted to speak to a lady catherine	 819.9750505447007
miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a	 692.0842723648695
with a fare from london and as he thought the circumstance of a	 143.61245081944202
the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt it soothed	 34.377417826997046
him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in	 332.0929348609972
five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about	 427.4785035384296
elopement to no creature had it been revealed where secresy was	 267.2148285621529
requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing	 815.2618855958506
of his designing friends and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to	 89.05358708745766
surmount even in speaking to mr bingley whose blind partiality	 533.4560146630314
seemed nothing but absence of mind	 104.79758819592935
my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i	 267.3071162608623
i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she your	 146.11218366141452
very welland this offer of marriage you have refused	 104.35517647378532
thing but himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs gardiner	 189.65174637698564
nowhy should he if it was not allowable for him to gain my	 28.851781274216254
evenings may do a great deal	 87.62205026801074
prejudiced absurd	 2.1555682567671157
how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains i felt a	 1025.5826114167876
the church door and every body had as much to say or to hear on the	 314.5784590559487
elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not	 93.33649713068894
but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so	 652.2913868836639
pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the	 424.89480876925154
money my uncle cried jane what do you mean sir	 439.6242553912487
fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper	 168.40841479947815
what he ever was	 114.74269727559731
doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections you	 481.69384032536914
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his	 60.5062417556704
that mr wickham had accepted their uncles invitation and was then in	 441.0189631773929
her younger daughters she could not take upon her to sayshe could	 586.8334860635587
wickham can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe	 754.9743597274761
mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted and	 163.1376459223693

if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to	 135.46551880910252
younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by	 500.086908716966

daughter	 18.746527952165902
an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth from this day you must	 245.06275234999305

illustration dovedale	 2.1555682567671157

that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as	 156.5290906923516
may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him and to him too	 585.8259217007396
but darcy was clever he was at the same time haughty reserved and	 32.60998627513018
certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i	 878.5770437881212
mrs reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy drawn	 247.03319920159146

against you had they been indifferent or had they even been	 1409.9220697579162
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park when	 669.8402940293312
without actual blame on either side	 194.85751263357776
she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty mrs hurst	 712.7438759847656
of usual cheerfulness but with no farther attempt to distinguish	 373.90242520942695
colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but darcy	 833.8644942230537
would be in her power to say something of the bingleys	 78.67976031323853
make his communication public on the contrary every particular relative	 354.8074413425223
still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth what do i not	 1870.1951113955013
coolly will be rather a confirmation of it if indeed such a report	 165.50584616788424
directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of mr darcys	 109.61822068723193
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage	 227.40190030874913
answered her hopes but alas the ladies had crowded round the table	 343.02538214947367
right my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how	 408.6289551320256
to depart mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing	 173.03687169108707
could not approve him nor could she for a moment repent her refusal or	 58.44754358374376

found wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in	 566.7775141623578
and they must marry yet he is such a man	 159.05662347711532
intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours	 444.19144232556835
mr bingley was good looking and gentlemanlike he had a pleasant	 221.52587009122448
heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day and tell my dear	 1122.3379264762225
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that	 157.04641013483587

in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do	 94.83320581434764
would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur	 182.77607906499387
accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those	 345.8804599330458

happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character	 1006.374152114174
from herself to janefrom jane to bingley her thoughts were in a line	 126.14841298498277
so speedy a return immediately said	 61.72160586388011

formidable by silence but whatever she said was spoken in so	 723.790170317205
himself while his wife seriously commended mr collins for having	 666.063382706328
he did not say what she then took a large house in edwardstreet	 326.17678334232056

to shake off her gravity i am trying to make it out	 23.23778153901743
error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been	 191.08736288513188

that you certainly shall	 94.42498581045692
how should you have liked making sermons	 276.21905327792973
the very next week she remembered also that till the netherfield	 304.3870034489784
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to	 16.838681416934794

happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not	 218.26028245499336

think of us i am sure wickham would like a place at court very	 395.75047210350067

there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those	 34.7397902757054

check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence	 56.68691872243301

her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to	 294.49405626002067
to offend mr darcyyou will never recommend yourself to his friend by	 271.86207662513374

the exertion would soon have been nothing one ought not to	 233.63436242313742
late mr darcys steward let me recommend you however as a friend	 454.32646997301305
turn about the roomi assure you it is very refreshing after sitting	 187.39423600317647
though often standing within a very short distance of her quite	 1236.347046886867

let me first see how he behaves said she it will then be early	 178.9203560981492
upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for	 122.88548575466199
there seemed an embargo on every subject at last she recollected that	 350.4501857247592
in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex	 44.53572534448023
liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a	 375.55193648634423
i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you	 176.77189526992686
loose to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible	 129.00484296506792
enough to make her understand his character	 10.628769839725237
as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side miss	 355.4535465871274
she had herself endured on a similar occasion five and twenty years	 644.8240385832358
pemberley was now georgianas home and the attachment of the sisters	 1186.521308729246
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as	 441.237193738279
pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintance every day but	 3547.3197047172916
superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of	 629.5995393264836
house they could not be necessary and it was not till easterday	 157.73347405996893
she felt herself to be right	 54.247397885529175
say if this be the case he deserves you i could not have parted with	 731.159970595632
i mention it to you mr robinsons asking him how he liked our meryton	 669.2468972117949
but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied	 75.43682961162818
the likeness of mr wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures	 36.68508220442066
to him oh how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation	 85.31765449560758
of my philosophy think only of the past as its remembrance gives you	 77.63303812787302
book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a	 444.6309709234191
elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the	 514.0042610389795
misrepresented	 1.962759145445629
heaven forbidthat would be the greatest misfortune of allto	 26.560978039322343
reason to question at one time she had almost resolved on applying to	 397.81934440400414
formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the	 378.0987188043168
lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so	 1116.3493793070504
elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a	 47.855011272624935
deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is	 451.3159147104796
bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the	 921.8901923458151
economy and other amiable qualifications	 154.9965617608796
out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all	 270.68040444278586
dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken almost as	 633.6066145750743
a little longer on your kindness	 127.1118225432252
campand from her correspondence with her sister there was still less	 84.3838227593404
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners	 268.57943083299955
gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothing	 914.0469092244854
nothing to do elsewhere	 16.679683802597253
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce but as to your	 73.98099425405894
body	 21.491948665705213
should make their appearance at st jamess the whole family in short	 396.3996120073178

you shall hear thenbut prepare yourself for something very dreadful	 93.70794057133367
chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr collins	 56.664066063007404
sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon	 496.8148360559915

noi do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did	 178.75616916783412
heartily they were wished away by some of the family mrs hurst and her	 75.23504222865286
abusive without saying any thing just but one cannot be always laughing	 491.5714250220973
suitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his own	 5.029757298957988
he was silent	 5.199474391410813
her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied	 655.7815810305253
she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton	 400.62528799864964
by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by	 200.78722715487112
miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he	 132.6205633439374
summer	 20.053767843137916
his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as shewed an	 140.64006872184262
women in the room and which he thought the prettiest and his	 219.6867657895316
with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself she was very	 261.2038724330226
the day of his and lydias departure soon came and mrs bennet was	 136.3319106181138
status with the irs	 2.508443829115449

money paid for a work or a replacement copy if a defect in the	 274.1733761165155
wonder at her being where she was	 49.18406180001629
his concern at having been prevented by business they then went away	 311.5519674169217
with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to	 290.6146466844968
her eldest sister ah jane i take your place now and you must go	 268.8395804054297
substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and	 78.26452704645281
he then told her of georgianas delight in her acquaintance and of her	 215.17232473538962
a point should admit of doubt but really i know not what to say	 246.49925074181982
elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else and after a pause of	 186.31489923663605
i should imagine not	 133.31936481295008
all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must yet	 586.695236123375
feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence of those	 30.137816926090764
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting	 531.1760005617264
twelvemonth happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance if	 734.2206877172966
darcy made no answer he seemed scarcely to hear her and was walking up	 356.47796938419
probably more than she felt for herself the carriage was sent to meet	 1399.3649175097141
dearest jane who could have done less for her but make a virtue of it	 449.43851285686725
resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence	 107.89114820976188
and if he does colonel forster will hire him my aunt told me so	 324.61779948617186
feelings though fervent were little displayed and that there was a	 96.87195785832192
soon be the wife of mr darcy console lady catherine as well as	 264.97627269984605
oh my dear father she cried come back and write immediately	 530.6008267283104
for the truth of every thing here related i can appeal more	 52.747310436961044

they each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with mr	 865.4371539102268

mrs bennets schemes for this day were ineffectual bingley was every	 419.99507953407044

child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my	 159.84464531606497
certainly he replied biting his lips elizabeth hoped she had	 460.9026815090938
as the greatest relief and not a day went by without a solitary walk	 418.98146739435623
pens remarkably well	 4.243103389897623
with her he might have better success he stood by her however for	 843.8534618187961
possibility as that she could encourage him herself and her	 217.97151140651377

as they walked home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass	 343.9467098559068
elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer than	 112.62916369764507
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of a	 58.281911705482464

that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion when mr	 160.09339668531376
advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though	 1743.3353518190938
believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this	 524.6450251437142
interferingand elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and	 55.680134836315325
wait in the drawingroom and whose shyness as they had not seen her	 191.39342880346703
she is a most charming young lady indeed lady catherine herself says	 505.7388644396636
herself but that after their removal it had been every where	 460.9051611852793
acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect	 236.88271033959543
disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a	 30.43071045009785
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first	 326.26275127222283
jane had written the direction remarkably ill	 231.48826703131814
enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting	 187.83426022989283
miss bingleys eyes were instantly turned towards darcy and she had	 329.83452512136864
give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them	 249.7217139862215
heaven are quite well	 29.370672409021015
elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her	 23.88486578006211
pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted	 786.273499460576
i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short	 31.49335628672374
making any answer she went on as before	 767.1544735053072
thought she could witness without trepidation	 32.6155172815584
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said	 343.9953900484124
advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts the advice	 173.4115245974312
till it were proved against them but jane knows as well as i do what	 401.2999091826732
pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they	 236.61827642721752
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen she	 506.77224372674993
the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess after	 77.99986060796572
bingleys regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence	 35.106063921039876
have told it all their situation was awkward enough but hers she	 523.2737478084231
that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged she would not	 63.12310758959749
spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer could there be	 1023.4950258802234
tacit engagement with miss de bourgh are you lost to every feeling of	 748.7226931012597
she will never deserve to be happy what a meeting for her when she	 147.93201650117888
sister my dear father i congratulate you	 157.4062231456365
rather offended and therefore checked her laugh miss bingley warmly	 154.88775883218497
certainly replied elizabeththere are such people but i hope i am	 408.9015624912264
former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that	 231.57172236406612
now accepted she had always felt that charlottes opinion of matrimony	 568.9996559571238
similarity in the turn of our mindswe are each of an unsocial	 231.294618551574
their party in the drawingroom the loo table however did not appear	 155.50265265193642
if we are ever able to learn what wickhams debts have been said	 715.6607662254487
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand jane now came up	 229.17636656838505
he shook his headi wish i could call her amiable it gives me pain	 477.56025245562086
others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so	 304.8522059297518
said mrs bennet to her husband and all the others equally well	 136.71492277590914
fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they	 279.3011105146637
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour bingley	 201.29431628772008
the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact	 441.9942428470984
particulars but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to	 133.8802091790986
much better i am sick of them all thank heaven i am going tomorrow	 283.2722000235193
much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of	 323.18808544684475
mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and	 658.1252741544154
can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it	 739.1125071268755
to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had	 606.0394537067118
i hope you will consent to be of the party indeed eliza you will be	 177.5263318189961
his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be	 851.6950212769243
them mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding	 65.95602507315625
imaginary but still he would be her husbandwithout thinking highly	 551.0316802903387
acquaintance that are really accomplished	 158.0521137136365
mr collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which	 243.4943064819637
so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear that	 192.98318906062107
honours us during your stay here her behaviour to my dear charlotte is	 851.8013830789316
no cheerful humour mr darcy was almost as far from her as the table	 880.6751130844603
his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling that had	 215.61141531211612
had often great enjoyment out of doors her favourite walk and where	 540.2409520142708
argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him	 625.037548376008
engagement and dancing with him tonight tell him i hope he will	 325.3303711369045
unaffected though not quite so chatty jane was anxious that no	 145.31962910955912
the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost	 31.685445574396127
the house	 3.2506807177735104
according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that	 221.2029683898736
mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made	 189.08815408369188
you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him	 344.41210519599565
and that its illsuccess might perhaps authorise her to seek the other	 114.8068105510179
you i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you	 898.4530261656524

well jane who is it from what is it about what does he say well	 1004.1433153756537
late to be saving mrs bennet had no turn for economy and her	 279.95277599085983
mr and mrs gardiners coming up they were all pressed to go into the	 90.35060322186476
of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some	 159.81818379529795
the match his being such a charming young man and so rich and living	 1296.4163443113105
they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in	 237.48131410549888
tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of	 190.43228680968656
weeks and to mrs gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction the	 923.9126270518245
ever since he was four years old	 135.5641778232179
thought was still worse not a syllable was uttered by either and	 495.46748895405386
tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in	 1032.4945005240427
silent till they reached the house their father then went to the	 368.49807911180574
a little	 3.752533265421405
though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in	 352.10101487033234
of having a companion	 489.1567159740527
to whom i have related the affair they agree with me in	 792.5339158574797
had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity	 56.842596283056054
a word about it till now	 129.74559678684952
spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to	 122.26640335136096
much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort	 944.961171717616
father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy	 218.53276484051293
and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he	 706.28296371294
to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark	 223.05686683227555
was surprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme	 656.8553994833514
and then we were so merry all the way home we talked and laughed so	 228.20322793767428

providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to	 103.52799839576242
were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere	 77.83857586805675
communication would therefore do for all after a slight preparation	 501.1719334215526
but mr gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours	 635.3588021267236
that is to say you had given your permission i guessed as much and	 466.4192824505982
that whether married or single he must always be her model of the	 352.8630737930393
ever had any thing from him except a few presents well i am so happy	 509.9779811995665

it was two or three days before he could get from her what he	 267.41972041319053

no one made any reply she then yawned again threw aside her book and	 450.4712603978576
your attendance upon her has been too much for you you do not look	 881.5520191851915
