sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane
he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down
of fun the other day at colonel forsters kitty and me were to spend
high she immediately said

feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether
cousins praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
last obliged to accept the secondhand intelligence of their neighbour
what jane felt for bingley her astonishment at his comingat his
her her brothers recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his
interest all her tender feelings and nothing therefore remained to be
but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so
mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him charlotte had seen

them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle and though kitty
she could not think of darcys leaving kent without remembering that
the tables were broke up the carriage was offered to mrs collins
no indeed i felt nothing but surprise
could not exist in the world two men over whom mr darcy could have

for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr
she made no answer
last night names facts every thing mentioned without ceremonyif it
correspond with the sister she will not be able to help calling
take care lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointment
her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend
yes vanity is a weakness indeed but pridewhere there is a real
significant look and smile from mrs annesley to miss darcy had been
delightfully how does georgiana get on darcy
mr and mrs gardiner smiled elizabeth could not help saying it is
elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to
person and address that can captivate a woman
they found mary as usual deep in the study of thorough bass and human
met elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an
were to entertain each other very little was said by either kitty was
wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of
her companions when is your turn to come you will hardly bear to be
have you any other objection said elizabeth than your belief of my
is gone down to her uncle at liverpool gone to stay wickham is safe
bingley if she could but lizzy oh sister it is very hard to think
manhe is a great friend of darcys
while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
manner observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he
with such a family and this consideration leads me moreover to
there was a motive within her of good will which could not be
esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his
laughingly answered
and i ought to feel it
he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but
steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and
otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your
taken to separate mr bingley and jane she had never doubted but she
mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and
charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her
mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
collinses live very comfortable do they well well i only hope it
you observed it mr darcy i am sure said miss bingley and i am
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the
no indeed i do not wish to avoid the walk the distance is nothing
tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
if you do
fitzwilliam i should like to know how he behaves among strangers
she will never play really well unless she practises more and though
wishes and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
than on his ownto convince him therefore that he had deceived
upon yourself alone
jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern she knew but little
is so decidedly beneath my own
but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had
acquaintance the subjection in which his father had brought him up had
of seeing mr darcythat mr darcy might leave the country but that
take his guest into the drawingroom again and when tea was over glad
colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send
accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without
breakfastroom where mrs bennet was alone than she likewise began on
advantage she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but
on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at
her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
ordinary style for i dare not hope he continued in a lower and more
happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more gentle adieus
darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the
income
i did not think caroline in spirits were her words but she was very
through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving mr
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic kitty was the
acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen
evenings scrutiny that though she received his attentions with
determined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets
formidable by silence but whatever she said was spoken in so
their marriage at all more probable supposing him to be attached to
mr collins and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be
proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs
private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before
wickham really is we both know that he has been profligate in every
of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children
darcy had much better finish his letter
here i am determined we must have mrs long and the gouldings soon
all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
looking at the picture it is a handsome face but lizzy you can tell
affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into
this was a sad omen of what her mothers behaviour to the gentleman
father was at leisure to be consulted one days delay she observed
it was a fortnight since mrs bennet had been down stairs but on this
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce but as to your

if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often
changed and she said no more

hundred a year but however do not speak to mr darcy about it
i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley how can mr bingley
illtempered man wickham only shook his head
does not care about you
elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall
that is a question which mr darcy only can answer
one or the other again
of which the time alone could be undecided from that moment i

maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern
in speaking of wickham to mr darcy for now they do appear wholly
and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy

no i believe not

about its relative situation let our first effusions be less
she enquired after his sister but could do no more
urgent business calls us home immediately conceal the unhappy truth as
by mrs hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey and
their two selves only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion
wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of the sight of

confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me
what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of every thing
mr darcy took her advice and did finish his letter
off together

less interesting mode of attachment be that as it may she saw him go
same lydias going to brighton was all that consoled her for the
dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
shortly checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her

original plan
her father lifted up his eyes jane was distressed elizabeth looked
therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that
it was time to be at home

all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshireand give me
though mrs bennets sour looks and illnatured remarks might have been
a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece while these

which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room and
happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in
as i sit by the fire
on one side of your lawn i should be glad to take a turn in it if you
she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out she
yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both

her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in
dying an old maid charlotte herself was tolerably composed she had

heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs her mother
she grew absolutely ashamed of herselfof neither darcy nor wickham

intention but mr darcy chose to doubt itor to treat it as a merely
clergyman and his rights as a rector made him altogether a mixture of
of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirms

that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than

in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her
it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen i was
in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant

gratefully accepted and immediately ordered the party then gathered
still something more to ask of the former my father is going to

delight in the prospect of their relationship they shook hands with
discouraged from speaking again and mr darcys contempt seemed
they walked on without knowing in what direction there was too much to

he then told her of georgianas delight in her acquaintance and of her
female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the
the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost
especially on lydias side but nothing to give him any alarm i am so
though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could
me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying
jane looked at her doubtingly oh lizzy it cannot be i know how much
to such perseverance in wilful selfdeception elizabeth would make no
curricle driving up the street elizabeth immediately recognising the

their journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm and
would be nothing i could see him with perfect indifference but i can
one morning about a week after bingleys engagement with jane had been
about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i
perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any
intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater

only four dances i am sorry to pain youbut so it was he danced only

indeed i am i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier
the compliment of such a mans affection and though her intentions did
not as you represent it had she merely dined with him she might
flirting i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
will easily comprehend from these particulars that mr wickhams
perhaps it would have been better replied her sister but to expose
first introduction he was too happy however to need much attention
secret mrs bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs philips and
lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte
was repeated to colonel f who instantly taking the alarm set off
greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were
on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till
such societybut she had chosen it with her eyes open and though
recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of
coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of every
calculation are heavy indeed but perhaps added he stopping in his

mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise

her aunt now called her to look at a picture she approached and saw

oh mr bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar
her judgment controverted she enquired into charlottes domestic
yesbut as it happens they are all of them very clever
it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose
no one made any reply she then yawned again threw aside her book and
stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines crowded with the young
was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their

he is also handsome replied elizabeth which a young man ought
elizabeth did not know what to make of it had she not seen him in

i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon
though it was not put in as it ought to be it was only said lately
it is not mr bingley said her husband it is a person whom i
it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth the
she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to
over that gravel walk i do not know a place in the country that is
their deserts but with him i believe it does not often happen the
no nothing at all
me i confessfor certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to
himself at netherfield such amiable qualities must speak for
the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have
in this interference from what she had said of her resolution to

the possibility of mr collinss fancying himself in love with her

all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of

might arise unpleasant to more than myself
charlotte once or twice she could discern a faint blush but in general
daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her
his partners oh that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance

cannot escape the acquaintance now
wickham is not so undeserving then as we have thought him said her
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would
that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
enjoyment like reading how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a
stay but real though unavailing concern would to heaven that any
elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was

you are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of your
reserve and caprice that the experience of three and twenty years had
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by

elizabeth would not oppose such an injunctionand a moments
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she

but of this answer lydia heard not a word she seldom listened to any
folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering
