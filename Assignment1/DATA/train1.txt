to oakham mount this morning it is a nice long walk and mr darcy has
it elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed
we were all dancing together at netherfield
it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should
but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely
declared that they were miserable they solaced their wretchedness
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself

standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and
elizabeth smiled

twelvemonth happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance if

language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time
she was engaged one day as she walked in reperusing janes last

any wish of doing him justice he expressed no regret for what he had

inconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
this was not very consoling to mrs bennet and therefore instead of
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn and what with the philipses
satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the
i would not be so fastidious as you are cried bingley for a
but it had not been so in derbyshire there he had talked to her
feelings followed them in silence she was overpowered by shame and
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane
such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not
this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure
turned silently away mrs bennet who fancied she had gained a complete

walk to meryton she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist
darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth

elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the

contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long
to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any

from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink the

colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send

of her chair not knowing which way to look elizabeth found herself
dear sir
