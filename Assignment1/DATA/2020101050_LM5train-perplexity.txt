PRIDE & PREJUDICE.	 34.24156922046106
CHAPTER I.	 254.0372352719546
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession	 39.41435990153084
of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.	 25.656511443153782
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his	 49.5369630378193
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds	 57.48788141824522
of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful	 19.911652443951205
property of some one or other of their daughters.	 84.19325410368509
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that	 41.267973756804885
Netherfield Park is let at last?"	 76.91443445241165
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.	 21.07908518621704
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she	 59.688269988582356
told me all about it."	 69.58477688442264
Mr. Bennet made no answer.	 15.009735574554794
"Do not you want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.	 31.29262405739983
"_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."	 12.982509623548282
This was invitation enough.	 29.66737739162406
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken	 30.067799389392547
by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came	 13.636131596012758
down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much	 67.89990184631064
delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is	 49.66377095264621
to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be	 47.17211173199242
in the house by the end of next week."	 28.240253056277446
"What is his name?"	 61.078828980855015
"Bingley."	 454.778358823175
"Is he married or single?"	 71.44877454881407
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four	 24.539554677074314
or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"	 64.38649893541037
"How so? how can it affect them?"	 105.84444367941983
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You	 14.058590070699848
must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."	 22.862879049868354
"Is that his design in settling here?"	 120.45524564947411
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he	 23.38880237368118
_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as	 38.88431763681387
soon as he comes."	 43.65180429823733
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send	 36.30179052819944
them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are	 45.46175760137096
as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the	 44.93894226185378
party."	 1293.9488738680216
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but	 23.475290826860746
I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now. When a woman has	 17.809999447145824
five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own	 67.92342459325772
beauty."	 2212.078411437485
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."	 21.44163844936354
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into	 21.08023423452625
the neighbourhood."	 69.61857966815941
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."	 16.920527060691878
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would	 56.957968746207555
be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,	 26.934182078107288
merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new	 157.4402327240746
comers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit	 24.430385384063005
him, if you do not."	 28.411559813716426
"You are over scrupulous surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very	 16.057641603958665
glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my	 21.230427252801043
hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though	 38.69321140045496
I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."	 36.45862719184189
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the	 14.868307207937667
others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so	 23.58928536514397
good humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the	 45.49181894829794
preference."	 2651.652844139274
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are	 46.166541946911906
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of	 55.27858045770332
quickness than her sisters."	 32.9001992087311
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take	 20.159124598229283
delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves."	 32.332824031972486
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They	 25.056886003237796
are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration	 41.249790073989445
these twenty years at least."	 31.3938433226576
"Ah! you do not know what I suffer."	 12.330704107545943
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four	 25.278216315965757
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."	 41.33599248237336
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not	 36.666226388136344
visit them."	 134.35418455248612
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them	 23.515581247473513
all."	 281.1320469278742
Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,	 22.028684693399505
reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had	 17.829747022575404
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind	 47.51475170186869
was less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding,	 33.57152668100196
little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented she	 38.113620085365
fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her	 33.32778519431317
daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.	 53.07844855872076
CHAPTER II.	 12.911953956184709
Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He	 15.96405506564304
had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his	 33.77751075357959
wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was	 27.17981274653174
paid, she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following	 34.27806993640263
manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he	 27.642761590165986
suddenly addressed her with,	 39.00280111078705
"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it Lizzy."	 50.924588900583515
"We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes," said her mother	 18.02809835802892
resentfully, "since we are not to visit."	 27.080206802078944
"But you forget, mama," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the	 28.403503896643286
assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him."	 21.534553737013837
"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces	 20.707738208385233
of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion	 22.50687656394876
of her."	 24.152927322591697
"No more have I," said Mr. Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you do	 23.7387341024638
not depend on her serving you."	 58.525075058537475
Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain	 33.943049381194506
herself, began scolding one of her daughters.	 71.49390860803422
"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake! Have a little	 75.87111844347021
compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces."	 30.679661463947074
"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times	 49.85214125842148
them ill."	 412.72513702868105
"I do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kitty fretfully.	 25.064976424470238
"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?"	 72.24981994127887
"To-morrow fortnight."	 130.47857536901483
"Aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs. Long does not come back	 16.70452245173428
till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him,	 26.234594082335466
for she will not know him herself."	 73.40325897752246
"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce	 26.489705426927156
Mr. Bingley to _her_."	 44.65202675071859
"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him	 48.89668118763648
myself; how can you be so teazing?"	 19.268862254039238
"I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly	 35.816075871766394
very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a	 37.48466141338808
fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after	 25.43786241080946
all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as	 55.30903995850956
she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will	 41.00476956198487
take it on myself."	 247.16049754733828
The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, "Nonsense,	 79.18109315994461
nonsense!"	 8789.441735227052
"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he. "Do	 39.0874004618612
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on	 24.779528583289668
them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,	 63.14521088765278
Mary? for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great	 55.782109327770215
books, and make extracts."	 127.26558336294548
Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.	 27.68485453803499
"While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr.	 61.34786128139574
Bingley."	 454.778358823175
"I am sick of Mr. Bingley," cried his wife.	 16.863874367712558
"I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so before? If I	 17.08168802358164
had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on	 36.65903723242531
him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we	 25.505543769263085
cannot escape the acquaintance now."	 165.2363581669323
The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.	 47.630829334468956
Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy	 40.76830615453486
was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the	 22.29191286176887
while.	 485.1868114488692
"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should	 34.915794563406784
persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to	 43.363886446934465
neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a	 47.249914195344004
good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said	 55.28175998986903
a word about it till now."	 92.3458979248966
"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said Mr. Bennet; and,	 31.229517995285295
as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.	 32.702083970871605
"What an excellent father you have, girls," said she, when the door was	 27.985947960645127
shut. "I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;	 22.008594118530844
or me either, for that matter. At our time of life, it is not so	 79.95296489106504
pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but	 51.296408249742505
for your sakes, we would do any thing. Lydia, my love, though you _are_	 54.932798560171896
the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next	 31.0154358620278
ball."	 2287.2042375107944
"Oh!" said Lydia stoutly, "I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the	 24.09820750656037
youngest, I'm the tallest."	 50.50868250449054
The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would	 19.52134705594832
return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to	 37.12999418770201
dinner.	 2091.015003694601
CHAPTER III.	 12.911953956184709
Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five	 59.165620212143246
daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her	 35.18220968356949
husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him	 53.746964303968845
in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and	 42.75031265053046
distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at	 18.71661021169711
last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour	 30.445980571964157
Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been	 55.476977852829854
delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely	 52.13870338631428
agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly	 25.65791598988965
with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of	 21.100335370952028
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively	 47.982207474193686
hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.	 42.64030303240259
"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,"	 37.42828967093633
said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well	 18.262296398958238
married, I shall have nothing to wish for."	 34.48965000755792
In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about ten	 43.07101320781279
minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being	 24.612773782340923
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard	 36.60389940097333
much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more	 87.66293768333394
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper	 47.39578245533543
window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.	 19.238458038728425
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had	 44.60098566203735
Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her	 29.683818403620588
housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley	 31.369485462947893
was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to	 16.50038602738376
accept the honour of their invitation, &c. Mrs. Bennet was quite	 31.51761435420375
disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town	 37.965557344857295
so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that	 26.524353492994656
he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never	 110.90534172216312
settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a	 36.549485105196084
little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a	 26.676064051992213
large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley	 45.66162211276318
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.	 75.13376694178802
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the	 44.07042199707454
day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought	 40.08420326311507
only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin. And when	 49.64282144781751
the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five	 66.80217719589464
altogether; Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and	 77.87146730557707
another young man.	 39.65548930089471
Mr. Bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant	 68.78361824114903
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,	 63.24939728323249
with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely	 34.25462346015557
looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention	 57.40712589582219
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and	 25.772923397836273
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after	 27.816445188578314
his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen	 52.88657399921527
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was	 22.575853340636343
much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great	 38.377940738588364
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust	 49.17306670320559
which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be	 24.37228510817565
proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his	 91.80862424211307
large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most	 66.36491442646935
forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared	 26.880428320622507
with his friend.	 54.9785897173282
Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal	 31.036340726056682
people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,	 50.22320728979559
was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one	 41.48672022668133
himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for	 98.50822707404075
themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced	 29.119968929023184
only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being	 31.648728429277938
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in	 39.56387562781886
walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.	 26.923105045364156
His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in	 20.294088814983773
the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again.	 28.9558654411204
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of	 58.060630492978994
his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his	 49.60492428732499
having slighted one of her daughters.	 45.841773469217486
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit	 33.42109751851832
down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been	 28.22472545507445
standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and	 24.70143939924412
Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his	 27.641338423644637
friend to join it.	 94.99075844671707
"Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance. I hate to see you	 55.050522519071876
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better	 105.54440689979182
dance."	 1840.0404837693914
"I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am	 21.809387503866443
particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this, it	 38.287810816983914
would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not	 28.7723171529428
another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to	 20.778446697901717
stand up with."	 80.5675444619167
"I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Bingley, "for a	 20.08309646260528
kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my	 12.991909582973795
life, as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see	 49.3991867573222
uncommonly pretty."	 199.24784437604512
"_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr.	 31.362902614900825
Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.	 44.430073972041264
"Oh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one	 36.30282403242766
of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I	 37.92288706834349
dare say, very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you."	 30.761149318757454
"Which do you mean?" and turning round, he looked for a moment at	 40.048583278380974
Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said,	 37.760356148600025
"She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no	 20.909492591777955
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted	 51.53090496915875
by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her	 33.53833383012813
smiles, for you are wasting your time with me."	 46.930344940524094
Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth	 53.889291823386735
remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story	 54.95843742053186
however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,	 41.333114933660546
playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.	 55.133595941605165
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.	 14.359128433631849
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield	 29.17400302811821
party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been	 25.58054785251728
distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this, as her	 36.74382500858968
mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's	 53.437695935598775
pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most	 40.87203325611939
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been	 27.243952173206
fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they	 46.59832823574885
had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned therefore in good	 45.537254029397175
spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they	 75.82727802497998
were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a	 43.574359742239444
book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a	 29.63072429703033
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised	 26.394110740269944
such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife's	 19.365595623689202
views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he	 39.62245078292434
had a very different story to hear.	 18.04266650811669
"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most	 19.17590011613258
delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.	 46.26129398822325
Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Every body said how well	 83.41213367859179
she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with	 41.69735792948601
her twice. Only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her	 42.42304203916288
twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second	 26.75867709786746
time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand	 63.150161796444344
up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody	 42.711364949418915
can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going	 38.744420613447
down the dance. So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and	 93.38727720374227
asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss	 52.23324668130323
King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane	 36.468049801922575
again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger----"	 26.28393509962721
"If he had had any compassion for _me_," cried her husband impatiently,	 50.829438382058
"he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of	 22.15141916969831
his partners. Oh! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!"	 25.0105571796905
"Oh! my dear," continued Mrs. Bennet, "I am quite delighted with him. He	 14.058093895065603
is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never	 28.754844531778556
in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the	 14.684011632697946
lace upon Mrs. Hurst's gown----"	 60.13914468357323
Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any	 40.0637605572161
description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch	 24.316190290875284
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some	 55.3376520828429
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.	 9.378172674016723
"But I can assure you," she added, "that Lizzy does not lose much by not	 28.603700897338946
suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at	 32.12572599932867
all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring	 32.694932642631976
him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very	 76.71649577933361
great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my	 33.947467840688105
dear, to have given him one of your set downs. I quite detest the man."	 62.38013114782972
CHAPTER IV.	 12.911953956184709
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in	 26.447481020359966
her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much	 38.474874400040655
she admired him.	 43.83063127692185
"He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good	 19.225120961981542
humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease,	 24.237811036805365
with such perfect good breeding!"	 30.822160005365312
"He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought	 37.63138734054802
likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete."	 81.09481848808863
"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I	 19.028555684712686
did not expect such a compliment."	 25.965047294759895
"Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference between	 46.73377086286331
us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What	 108.72897113678437
could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help	 20.28390363492673
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in	 39.868863590333085
the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is	 52.99785652289296
very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a	 44.90203082572335
stupider person."	 135.09214460043475
"Dear Lizzy!"	 119.11338314978623
"Oh! you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general.	 22.07674480475651
You never see a fault in any body. All the world are good and agreeable	 46.54680313239249
in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life."	 18.773300119818096
"I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak	 31.828018577912204
what I think."	 42.621545362646216
"I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_	 67.48156135071018
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of	 32.537064840313626
others! Affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every	 41.543228974320016
where. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good	 97.67502343974085
of every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of	 60.662508747649966
the bad--belongs to you alone. And so, you like this man's sisters too,	 76.70708014124708
do you? Their manners are not equal to his."	 28.217313331413777
"Certainly not; at first. But they are very pleasing women when you	 26.11247515317546
converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep	 40.80130541394386
his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming	 18.87582029932802
neighbour in her."	 134.05080113094536
Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at	 60.37936517062518
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more	 32.9499962834487
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and	 28.631237032700636
with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very	 35.19724059731746
little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not	 25.73345968770111
deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of	 14.312915567082433
being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited. They were	 75.83626348434144
rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private	 32.45910939527843
seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the	 22.531751483189783
habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people	 59.19628506485953
of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of	 33.536640522516706
themselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in	 46.73724036334386
the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their	 28.56113588103929
memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been	 35.903950488059415
acquired by trade.	 14.319918766901976
Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred	 35.66140248039427
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,	 22.92475874706082
but did not live to do it.--Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and	 60.04220811148497
sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a	 26.43170184819611
good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those	 18.748243232325752
who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the	 34.872586900684716
remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to	 44.991273496940735
purchase.	 9538.865061579381
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but	 27.424764249252934
though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no	 25.490760641607487
means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had	 25.868499293186474
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider	 35.213249708999236
his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of	 45.40023396954174
age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to	 45.36777839621374
look at Netherfield House. He did look at it and into it for half an	 44.449706696102695
hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied	 36.579849640174594
with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.	 106.16468445938918
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a	 18.602133092928938
great opposition of character.--Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the	 29.389166402107925
easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could	 23.352938940461836
offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never	 52.178890531700944
appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the	 64.51220239113297
firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In	 38.32924063764758
understanding Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient,	 36.644003081746106
but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and	 28.841732905875517
fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting. In	 29.670190154533728
that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of	 57.832871290495035
being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offence.	 95.07510664462313
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently	 44.634023199119035
characteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier	 30.54892129306862
girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him,	 36.21370459846789
there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted	 45.701580302766274
with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel	 19.753519873228118
more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people	 57.887146684657594
in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had	 29.92168771676636
felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or	 101.24865859424044
pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too	 65.99149204724922
much.	 416.2524507473654
Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired	 33.08032592898603
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom	 36.40827677322444
they should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore	 26.044154798104255
established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such	 62.176653167529096
commendation to think of her as he chose.	 56.440732510975195
CHAPTER V.	 12.911953956184709
Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets	 43.840273736587434
were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade	 19.672228372670414
in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the	 20.52687147186371
honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty.	 41.924526340628944
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a	 38.85213134092307
disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and	 31.48858051817739
quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a	 64.39902005916424
mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he	 35.58427460808409
could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by	 31.67507383766374
business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For	 60.70826201115088
though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the	 35.52921374136959
contrary, he was all attention to every body. By nature inoffensive,	 56.247113921010126
friendly and obliging, his presentation at St. James's had made him	 17.579807298090163
courteous.	 8.776652323334677
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a	 29.252173775042753
valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet.--They had several children. The	 79.91203331756604
eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven,	 135.85334035572976
was Elizabeth's intimate friend.	 65.41798061796008
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a	 39.5707628227482
ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly	 50.41712141675546
brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.	 56.49141257137919
"_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs. Bennet with civil	 75.95007214212613
self-command to Miss Lucas. "_You_ were Mr. Bingley's first choice."	 31.7912187012148
"Yes;--but he seemed to like his second better."	 66.19259736794706
"Oh!--you mean Jane, I suppose--because he danced with her twice. To be	 37.06156696329144
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he	 40.668320694829724
_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something	 57.52033885631998
about Mr. Robinson."	 111.84126715778802
"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not	 38.52104597289635
I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton	 82.64784844233222
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty	 25.16071077043984
women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his	 34.60588159472148
answering immediately to the last question--Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet	 45.96296014680306
beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point."	 43.09228148616678
"Upon my word!--Well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as	 48.56246912158338
if----but however, it may all come to nothing you know."	 63.16819616266162
"_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza," said	 45.406208775821575
Charlotte. "Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,	 30.68678545882834
is he?--Poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_."	 152.02064397896845
"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his	 33.40123814942842
ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite	 18.580601492755584
a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he	 26.63287187016426
sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips."	 18.606629645009015
"Are you quite sure, Ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?" said	 103.44050597665534
Jane.--"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her."	 33.369722719261006
"Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he	 33.21000436238721
could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at	 34.66338185801995
being spoke to."	 48.284560974503655
"Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks much unless	 30.399011835306567
among his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is remarkably	 74.41815827052115
agreeable."	 986.8837205454901
"I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very	 13.41779011741142
agreeable he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it was;	 47.60103155117896
every body says that he is ate up with pride, and I dare say he had	 17.091172214972396
heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to	 59.43169632387718
the ball in a hack chaise."	 49.99239034386128
"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long," said Miss Lucas, "but I	 41.0644934702119
wish he had danced with Eliza."	 135.7864808768233
"Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with _him_,	 30.9588112982792
if I were you."	 83.32363580110139
"I believe, Ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him."	 30.606340597905064
"His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend _me_ so much as pride	 29.65857495023717
often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so	 65.63461983249148
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour,	 48.32095852228724
should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_	 37.49809670393474
to be proud."	 75.33475029284234
"That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive	 20.77538568204403
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_."	 45.07289473793963
"Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her	 29.311667427781828
reflections, "is a very common failing I believe. By all that I have	 30.174659603157746
ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human	 22.94046120258807
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us	 40.183417975940166
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some	 20.485086107413494
quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different	 36.81838174891735
things, though the words are often used synonimously. A person may be	 64.23097511549551
proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of	 70.7574156124881
ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us."	 65.45716197625484
"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy," cried a young Lucas who came with his	 50.2249828133344
sisters, "I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of	 44.78737026468135
foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day."	 22.668953423156847
"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said Mrs.	 37.4711347914004
Bennet; "and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle	 31.213485522760088
directly."	 2867.1585406385684
The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she	 22.75310344103605
would, and the argument ended only with the visit.	 80.70751925871261
CHAPTER VI.	 12.911953956184709
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit	 62.87374759639542
was returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the	 23.29767182449736
good will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was	 30.002927138400437
found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a	 53.263829231950105
wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the	 46.09920593046708
two eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest	 32.782115989963565
pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of	 72.90373936497765
every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;	 41.86545134013338
though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in	 58.442922780368725
all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. It was	 24.858254674369082
generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to	 49.06899175204825
_her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference	 24.954104132290464
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a	 22.82549135004919
way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it	 30.693852004838547
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane	 20.71865466347929
united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a	 36.144155689663
uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the	 21.453122695926012
suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss	 46.803117911250034
Lucas.	 7471.940782461247
"It may perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to be able to impose	 23.759470989188376
on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be	 28.922337547421773
so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill	 54.64112130057681
from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and	 29.300646434552892
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the	 33.51796114394329
dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every	 24.063524961113036
attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all	 67.85968919362817
_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are	 71.86837379405922
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without	 25.99558238435962
encouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_	 72.85771080232648
affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he	 64.76437571889744
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on."	 30.77168580300583
"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If _I_ can	 46.70651135923775
perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to	 39.487378031810984
discover it too."	 78.527658268264
"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do."	 24.012706925992543
"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal	 33.68005224067006
it, he must find it out."	 58.4577227914967
"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane	 97.21271633809666
meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they	 55.120345487128965
always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that	 41.06365560541477
every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should	 59.198089362125486
therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his	 54.52275690884504
attention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling	 35.791047722550324
in love as much as she chuses."	 27.16485730019028
"Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing is in	 51.980334865315584
question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined	 48.97943213511411
to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But	 21.51141260156256
these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she	 43.18144873875041
cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its	 46.7242436561001
reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four	 50.4781650154282
dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,	 37.97444202008577
and has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite	 41.16482439253363
enough to make her understand his character."	 29.07085085890217
"Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might	 52.10292513481465
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must	 38.3479485877049
remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four	 37.521085545541695
evenings may do a great deal."	 37.40306285254527
"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both	 29.99720134439116
like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other	 52.008799052522335
leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded."	 23.92047402685118
"Well," said Charlotte, "I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if	 48.62876250981695
she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a	 62.601946675923955
chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a	 28.605823365507646
twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If	 60.642279896547144
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or	 21.918446665036686
ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the	 21.49234335807422
least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to	 79.38874012246234
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as	 27.365779414549003
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your	 65.0267882769482
life."	 3523.8946560797235
"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not	 15.7892981782417
sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."	 38.43588698066501
Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth	 34.324896948535425
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some	 33.162122249481016
interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely	 20.244196715110405
allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the	 44.04669595100276
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no	 33.672157522714556
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had	 32.29746075209697
hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered	 52.09623302631472
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To	 42.18274432489488
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had	 24.48321345436485
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry	 31.058503876490224
in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and	 23.78262118493893
pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those	 29.287460641827806
of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of	 19.06664806408797
this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made	 56.37318580283181
himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough	 70.22328122102168
to dance with.	 30.681402645356556
He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing	 36.33938090880719
with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so	 82.39237592534197
drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were	 38.56337116983031
assembled.	 8.776652323334677
"What does Mr. Darcy mean," said she to Charlotte, "by listening to my	 60.399365987334306
conversation with Colonel Forster?"	 28.193921251336004
"That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer."	 25.62598808619471
"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see	 38.65087669919382
what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by	 24.320048138339185
being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him."	 33.92107538816268
On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have	 46.59251358990833
any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such	 61.20815116474209
a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she	 53.74167921521953
turned to him and said,	 82.34250396526438
"Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well	 19.082142587438245
just now, when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at	 36.81059538131051
Meryton?"	 1279.5472411991727
"With great energy;--but it is a subject which always makes a lady	 30.305726627739084
energetic."	 8.776652323334677
"You are severe on us."	 28.313300848411224
"It will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed," said Miss Lucas. "I am going	 30.955409976631376
to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows."	 65.23100779462813
"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me	 23.01362886703235
to play and sing before any body and every body!--If my vanity had taken	 55.40860612684836
a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would	 28.378655876404608
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of	 20.004044129411838
hearing the very best performers." On Miss Lucas's persevering, however,	 77.96963787152742
she added, "Very well; if it must be so, it must." And gravely glancing	 47.69190847896346
at Mr. Darcy, "There is a fine old saying, which every body here is of	 36.23728598564489
course familiar with--'Keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and I	 39.5636549711631
shall keep mine to swell my song."	 39.40365810622495
Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song	 31.37252377602784
or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she	 36.01916048335675
would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her	 26.922696934012233
sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in	 54.223954737751654
the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always	 65.36966545156858
impatient for display.	 54.67407246449699
Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her	 30.744843536985975
application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited	 48.556321550024684
manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she	 19.823800889364765
had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with	 66.76912379247838
much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the	 54.5613603544342
end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by	 47.93307872547486
Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with	 15.223373386785637
some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing	 36.90220441570093
at one end of the room.	 30.693442761495547
Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of	 20.22932572282459
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too	 41.262811052946645
much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas	 20.953924368024992
was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began.	 47.208011944026026
"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!--There	 76.84534415563355
is nothing like dancing after all.--I consider it as one of the first	 27.648672089072143
refinements of polished societies."	 9.002303258780596
"Certainly, Sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue	 70.04966684361523
amongst the less polished societies of the world.--Every savage can	 29.14703079965025
dance."	 1840.0404837693914
Sir William only smiled. "Your friend performs delightfully;" he	 44.19913620907441
continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group;--"and I doubt	 46.87441176569746
not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy."	 34.51673485261141
"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, Sir."	 41.59730147912411
"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do	 97.47000410042578
you often dance at St. James's?"	 27.183403010370732
"Never, sir."	 588.9569661763148
"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"	 19.86584288664966
"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it."	 22.48755613111577
"You have a house in town, I conclude?"	 34.40721412345674
Mr. Darcy bowed.	 21.195863972348125
"I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself--for I am fond of	 35.79249753265829
superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of	 52.14504214135857
London would agree with Lady Lucas."	 82.73046506087799
He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to	 29.528859266465343
make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was	 106.42913776444827
struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to	 26.038901687884014
her,	 78.9221597765657
"My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing?--Mr. Darcy, you must allow	 22.486999591075534
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.--You	 40.74739502124955
cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you."	 39.14692189169446
And taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though	 27.521812118376122
extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly	 44.13020691131542
drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,	 31.72924121989102
"Indeed, Sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.--I entreat you	 23.39035757586837
not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner."	 61.94424975835482
Mr. Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her	 33.47052088011558
hand; but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all	 69.28307807332816
shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.	 48.509845848882634
"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me	 27.664456284978748
the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the	 33.19484451248358
amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us	 32.37329877735868
for one half hour."	 40.17417392343734
"Mr. Darcy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling.	 17.537882714480677
"He is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we	 28.995834800509737
cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a	 45.74432866336205
partner?"	 2736.401994849058
Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not	 31.800875907569303
injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some	 29.278154645506486
complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,	 35.418222935410896
"I can guess the subject of your reverie."	 17.366604532117673
"I should imagine not."	 65.6957371931191
"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings	 29.975920000253097
in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.	 43.53275473568545
I was never more annoyed! The insipidity and yet the noise; the	 34.99480343231995
nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!--What would	 16.563616847567484
I give to hear your strictures on them!"	 71.86186979330805
"Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more	 29.351439598981266
agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure	 18.28108342535181
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."	 34.73730152284956
Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he	 34.128469953971916
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.	 52.77014263557126
Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity,	 29.775714394115045
"Miss Elizabeth Bennet."	 48.93642396876006
"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley. "I am all astonishment.	 37.650973769750436
How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray when am I to wish you	 43.96932855969172
joy?"	 8140.036793435991
"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady's	 34.17285763642195
imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love	 62.87714914664237
to matrimony in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy."	 28.119789891505178
"Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as	 35.87141641797034
absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and	 61.67436686321694
of course she will be always at Pemberley with you."	 37.57214058454115
He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to	 25.219910096970924
entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her	 32.64848714882199
that all was safe, her wit flowed long.	 98.81963874056207
CHAPTER VII.	 12.911953956184709
Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two	 33.71690733118498
thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in	 50.148422685508365
default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's	 22.726574776933777
fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply	 35.65973133882655
the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and	 18.85592247576617
had left her four thousand pounds.	 38.181014157259035
She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their	 30.489347819336103
father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in	 46.0367596704889
London in a respectable line of trade.	 15.759023009248459
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most	 20.774176042686623
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted	 19.277408750162856
thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and	 18.52614123693122
to a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,	 22.7845705516835
Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;	 50.87888237802761
their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing	 28.66325780036146
better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning	 41.14267512972355
hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news	 75.50301025144977
the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some	 38.24588737682729
from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with	 78.8152436442997
news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the	 23.41069474539703
neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the	 34.33272788302343
head quarters.	 251.95579933035307
Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting	 29.761330575809446
intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the	 65.43424645056626
officers' names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret,	 54.68074885151817
and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips	 35.65876611496273
visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity	 34.21589952328597
unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.	 65.90365241261492
Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their	 66.89145443796197
mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of	 28.738255032799213
an ensign.	 60.290885776391455
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.	 23.227543546756962
Bennet coolly observed,	 223.59624337158402
"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two	 31.545623604944506
of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but	 24.2777524065666
I am now convinced."	 13.9176190075276
Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect	 38.163641834517115
indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and	 44.782429076500804
her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the	 18.06031838513776
next morning to London.	 30.193472951292435
"I am astonished, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet, "that you should be so	 11.068163638780549
ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly	 23.21760508095704
of any body's children, it should not be of my own however."	 36.488523801874145
"If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it."	 19.237027795543504
"Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever."	 43.519796097368605
"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I	 33.95645006399472
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must	 44.42055297508257
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly	 29.539946661422206
foolish."	 4089.266945475232
"My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of	 20.061860854445552
their father and mother.--When they get to our age I dare say they will	 46.957978112665586
not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I	 62.3656077283788
liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so I do still at my heart;	 56.33902833068056
and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should	 70.77711606184579
want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel	 39.84914336848553
Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his	 58.71174870760768
regimentals."	 8.776652323334677
"Mama," cried Lydia, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain	 21.4562591452426
Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first	 64.01137158203501
came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library."	 62.77199511082834
Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a	 15.370199049199584
note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited	 54.66163973830613
for an answer. Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was	 34.35866507406205
eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,	 79.23405087261538
"Well, Jane, who is it from? what is it about? what does he say? Well,	 46.737940871493066
Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love."	 30.397573558659055
"It is from Miss Bingley," said Jane, and then read it aloud.	 21.716783953505107
"My dear Friend,	 30.797988270194157
"If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and	 15.82403901631842
me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our	 21.921082749083805
lives, for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never	 25.455119634699248
end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the receipt of	 52.912159655519034
this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.	 46.97572251527744
Yours ever,	 425.3480964718369
"CAROLINE BINGLEY."	 171.27121942313966
"With the officers!" cried Lydia. "I wonder my aunt did not tell us of	 34.43469028227518
_that_."	 78.74485314587258
"Dining out," said Mrs. Bennet, "that is very unlucky."	 55.92394116589593
"Can I have the carriage?" said Jane.	 37.80382195599466
"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to	 22.059951099522138
rain; and then you must stay all night."	 28.831251781238823
"That would be a good scheme," said Elizabeth, "if you were sure that	 22.935021813155647
they would not offer to send her home."	 36.42375839743703
"Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton;	 27.635017009335513
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs."	 39.37760240128481
"I had much rather go in the coach."	 50.80788988976944
"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are	 19.024176569799597
wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?"	 53.9857657598331
"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them."	 42.36762480689425
"But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's purpose	 21.417593129001922
will be answered."	 85.39303720186689
She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses	 39.00856974584695
were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her	 29.52242806966836
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad	 49.507138642143936
day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it	 81.14174142124766
rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was	 37.15956226013874
delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;	 66.57449006217576
Jane certainly could not come back.	 35.93578228138201
"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said Mrs. Bennet, more than	 24.39845272518634
once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next	 58.008191498146466
morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her	 23.52410994983897
contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield	 81.88460121148964
brought the following note for Elizabeth:	 53.57455260870234
"My dearest Lizzy,	 14.331936249814936
"I FIND myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be	 39.12154369725426
imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will	 36.95030931718114
not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also on	 33.954972321877484
my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear	 32.16363165524373
of his having been to me--and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache	 20.554435767300404
there is not much the matter with me.	 34.79815318422123
"Yours, &c."	 79.3466902163023
"Well, my dear," said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note	 44.74032019535655
aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she	 31.470395488783403
should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of	 21.64771781955295
Mr. Bingley, and under your orders."	 32.11325768507857
"Oh! I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little	 24.510736306540405
trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays	 31.43695697015218
there, it is all very well. I would go and see her, if I could have the	 41.89680755690002
carriage."	 1972.6750485708906
Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though	 62.56870075310509
the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking	 33.96119219481632
was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.	 68.81473657767113
"How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a	 15.741161671299386
thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get	 25.979660087535443
there."	 264.1154840987739
"I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want."	 44.08738778016229
"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for the	 44.322966054703286
horses?"	 6144.949731746579
"No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing,	 40.28086839733801
when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner."	 49.20143007365967
"I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed Mary, "but every	 28.124812767964574
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,	 23.666438320579896
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required."	 30.693178973419855
"We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine and	 76.36139504581361
Lydia.--Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set	 19.65126670769668
off together.	 494.1779477798659
"If we make haste," said Lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may	 28.31524330455637
see something of Captain Carter before he goes."	 37.36258487741307
In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one	 20.208500317154222
of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing	 57.62535831175079
field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing	 34.59056035666244
over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within	 47.89738797143977
view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face	 29.06118813422871
glowing with the warmth of exercise.	 27.240849319786783
She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were	 33.21705834722541
assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of	 13.104037244985419
surprise.--That she should have walked three miles so early in the day,	 34.662055694027735
in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs.	 50.2660648142773
Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her	 20.67337288346626
in contempt for it. She was received, however, very politely by them;	 47.762915152735026
and in their brother's manners there was something better than	 23.56187113078959
politeness; there was good humour and kindness.--Mr. Darcy said very	 38.89070159386264
little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between	 52.16661063615158
admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion,	 28.081904034331398
and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The	 54.38097651356348
latter was thinking only of his breakfast.	 172.6979995896486
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss	 39.12130156790643
Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well	 73.77375126999746
enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her	 31.113624919101007
immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving	 30.606929331102382
alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed	 73.03035159281102
for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,	 29.418935465552536
however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together,	 44.36744598533603
could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the	 75.84217296153626
extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended	 92.14487985601933
her.	 78.9221597765657
When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth	 30.88500709345909
began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and	 42.11033184128911
solicitude they shewed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having	 98.27708011702511
examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a	 28.7456070495325
violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;	 36.709369796068344
advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice	 48.47732776033464
was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head	 33.1545437778853
ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were	 16.839510144182636
the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact	 61.8930186077972
nothing to do elsewhere.	 63.687579510935734
When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very	 37.77718578428494
unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only	 66.97119089128661
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern	 58.75648267906308
in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer	 26.319725582442025
of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the	 21.1571256666113
present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was	 60.61315909837045
dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring	 33.84043154363978
back a supply of clothes.	 171.2285813510758
CHAPTER VIII.	 12.911953956184709
At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six	 42.63599067668388
Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil enquiries which then	 33.01871884755404
poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the	 24.60601884262375
much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very	 38.42305755146923
favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing	 43.08775325565658
this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how	 17.843561528661056
shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked	 22.64041598347799
being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their	 43.70297972760109
indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored	 68.94525468810929
Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.	 35.0480339983733
Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could	 28.756886205252137
regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his	 69.30072871906825
attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling	 56.59296829812199
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the	 30.481281302697408
others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was	 51.87088170659823
engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.	 45.89678505247495
Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to	 49.55202130984856
eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish	 39.79725318463659
to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.	 22.859493590348993
When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley	 25.159325082006017
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were	 29.39783637156861
pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;	 27.667505866105145
she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst	 47.956778021492106
thought the same, and added,	 115.85511336165669
"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent	 50.72457081737623
walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really	 51.01942475175038
looked almost wild."	 192.3239896180261
"She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very	 38.330967516476846
nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the	 35.69530704954937
country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowsy!"	 82.1390567282471
"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep	 68.47456963348469
in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to	 20.145976112477616
hide it, not doing its office."	 77.36957413590012
"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa," said Bingley; "but this was	 32.6593134192559
all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably	 80.17247822771863
well, when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat	 28.96825282160763
quite escaped my notice."	 46.11946969952229
"_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure," said Miss Bingley; "and I am	 15.291910350004867
inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such	 36.09604812449347
an exhibition."	 60.290885776391455
"Certainly not."	 69.8428375023485
"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,	 12.60179014752553
above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by	 66.9835944759838
it? It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence,	 37.93118929837144
a most country town indifference to decorum."	 23.353471263777386
"It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said	 36.28697044025452
Bingley.	 454.778358823175
"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy," observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,	 22.450611411434814
"that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine	 67.61391570821448
eyes."	 4960.019050313685
"Not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise."--A	 19.130163370675945
short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again.	 32.48479774949979
"I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet	 52.579007268673564
girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such	 50.461931455317014
a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no	 18.039968455879222
chance of it."	 44.83431062738181
"I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in	 23.78201818952891
Meryton."	 1279.5472411991727
"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside."	 54.8213688771505
"That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.	 28.13284639601382
"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it	 32.07649929672216
would not make them one jot less agreeable."	 47.79931598378699
"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any	 46.428261374427535
consideration in the world," replied Darcy.	 35.32301491602916
To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their	 34.518553965214345
hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of	 14.214526641314448
their dear friend's vulgar relations.	 46.358662378050745
With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on	 37.78441831229834
leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.	 40.21321088565124
She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till	 20.482518629837706
late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and	 24.988972733855093
when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go	 40.345463218839775
down stairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole	 31.43162533727761
party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting	 45.98610354914537
them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the	 42.385679488233436
excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay	 46.45327212688275
below with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.	 40.45213335709289
"Do you prefer reading to cards?" said he; "that is rather singular."	 48.938664995690864
"Miss Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, "despises cards. She is a great	 27.220399956832363
reader and has no pleasure in anything else."	 35.16657557642795
"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried Elizabeth; "I am	 28.735852574160216
_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things."	 25.163090990581537
"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure," said Bingley; "and	 18.064582466289124
I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well."	 28.314578693459808
Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table	 27.894986138296485
where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her	 17.94835909367513
others; all that his library afforded.	 59.07661982032751
"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own	 32.89704935613755
credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more	 26.881850324263198
than I ever look into."	 84.8258383317483
Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those	 44.71612829290584
in the room.	 16.810369185226904
"I am astonished," said Miss Bingley, "that my father should have left	 16.783455213695213
so small a collection of books.--What a delightful library you have at	 22.299263235365647
Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!"	 155.7087653824341
"It ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many	 34.91032138915771
generations."	 8.776652323334677
"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying	 35.33724154617629
books."	 3908.1249658633606
"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as	 27.59108139081555
these."	 1310.9007249153078
"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of	 29.879225481969904
that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be	 28.927987435675597
half as delightful as Pemberley."	 101.74265296722537
"I wish it may."	 39.71450888749737
"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that	 24.757964844814442
neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a	 32.36938676921599
finer county in England than Derbyshire."	 54.5799656756999
"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it."	 31.87570343581511
"I am talking of possibilities, Charles."	 26.911630206770383
"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get	 22.982085173412656
Pemberley by purchase than by imitation."	 86.18125631090834
Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little	 31.107443027776412
attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near	 38.47097362265831
the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest	 22.29729013652022
sister, to observe the game.	 88.13119824635532
"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Miss Bingley; "will	 36.980762176456324
she be as tall as I am?"	 54.25366125841855
"I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or	 86.64813651595708
rather taller."	 84.96200299668814
"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me	 32.09093368467018
so much. Such a countenance, such manners! and so extremely	 76.4873585403982
accomplished for her age! Her performance on the piano-forte is	 89.1642988065118
exquisite."	 8.776652323334677
"It is amazing to me," said Bingley, "how young ladies can have patience	 20.495877579954357
to be so very accomplished, as they all are."	 35.58909523965791
"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?"	 29.996045491975988
"Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover skreens and net	 40.213848686357785
purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and I am sure I	 30.051735079803855
never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being	 42.69579226494508
informed that she was very accomplished."	 38.095427856663015
"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "has	 20.988300857957295
too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no	 63.768044574389776
otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen. But I am very	 24.16657461230392
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I	 44.12026995097886
cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my	 23.87311759037367
acquaintance, that are really accomplished."	 79.48864182888005
"Nor I, I am sure," said Miss Bingley.	 39.2948243153109
"Then," observed Elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your	 32.95275584783054
idea of an accomplished woman."	 44.25909588143827
"Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it."	 22.949582445029566
"Oh! certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really	 38.88428448038203
esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met	 43.19334987082778
with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,	 25.725728218979647
dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all	 43.03470651858113
this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of	 30.243140907547325
walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word	 80.76016570418709
will be but half deserved."	 130.03205204730887
"All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she must yet	 79.75658947830793
add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by	 34.846161212375044
extensive reading."	 129.85521522936926
"I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.	 22.700449254532927
I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_."	 63.260933010216824
"Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all	 25.735216332317172
this?"	 179.3298871670305
"_I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and	 13.585166752286971
application, and elegance, as you describe, united."	 90.0890953776627
Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her	 23.596777662719838
implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who	 50.98876697031505
answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with	 43.80324779513501
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all	 32.25337986953159
conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the	 51.58681821936838
room.	 1975.9306334953155
"Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, "is	 51.590629698816514
one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other	 17.527270007937357
sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it	 26.20108085418929
succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art."	 26.402494845029203
"Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,	 73.7773674356282
"there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend	 30.03616415481895
to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is	 34.81265813844424
despicable."	 8.776652323334677
Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to	 26.97541466990166
continue the subject.	 173.15481086569403
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and	 24.205866739004655
that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones's being sent for	 42.5038306407027
immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could	 88.58058138986868
be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most	 32.362052019584496
eminent physicians. This, she would not hear of; but she was not so	 25.87056355119763
unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled	 19.78915982394059
that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet	 36.039727701764875
were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters	 65.80106798965181
declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,	 37.40770271152327
however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to	 52.087976540659994
his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every	 101.68986799023202
possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.	 49.38043137730294
CHAPTER IX.	 12.911953956184709
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the	 25.49511773835407
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the	 20.283133035533705
enquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,	 33.12205744303032
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his	 18.173401219644468
sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a	 37.030828715691584
note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her	 75.68516425824686
own judgment of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and	 46.642410487469185
its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her	 30.903740238195372
two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.	 36.83143963348952
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been	 38.46677111868936
very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was	 50.411047405209
not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her	 33.97118248964844
restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She	 40.557180875830916
would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried	 28.528058365013194
home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think	 65.21477118280308
it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss	 42.61231998988766
Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all	 95.66149718865421
attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes	 56.169757647864834
that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.	 36.00110111225442
"Indeed I have, Sir," was her answer. "She is a great deal too ill to be	 41.01970897777859
moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass	 46.36730903123532
a little longer on your kindness."	 36.167336609831544
"Removed!" cried Bingley. "It must not be thought of. My sister, I am	 32.19897829715717
sure, will not hear of her removal."	 30.90390118925764
"You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,	 13.054520318357463
"that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she	 39.195370195602
remains with us."	 264.17140105094376
Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.	 12.551534333378493
"I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends I do not	 22.06154065884671
know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a	 30.808140744433377
vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is	 21.32464667778801
always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest	 59.2972931476114
temper I ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to	 58.579033005265515
_her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect	 40.371004137519236
over that gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is	 39.56667716760611
equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I	 23.116321618062166
hope, though you have but a short lease."	 94.24288122552062
"Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if I	 45.96764852626944
should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five	 65.5946671811192
minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here."	 81.3785801076417
"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said Elizabeth.	 19.339312125354915
"You begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning towards her.	 49.5856697049821
"Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly."	 135.0512140595468
"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen	 57.47898278972011
through I am afraid is pitiful."	 71.88792721102443
"That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep,	 38.23476523992093
intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours."	 44.45150081410506
"Lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in	 58.527892093772394
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."	 36.143435843702974
"I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately, "that you were a	 38.7310357970652
studier of character. It must be an amusing study."	 25.4976105905732
"Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at	 63.32466174808254
least that advantage."	 420.5158595433686
"The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but few subjects for	 42.69265628822051
such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined	 25.86681155166493
and unvarying society."	 69.9698778230224
"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be	 36.94685647457829
observed in them for ever."	 273.4970953188583
"Yes, indeed," cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a	 20.105704297254096
country neighbourhood. "I assure you there is quite as much of _that_	 30.374019431165426
going on in the country as in town."	 38.876306315224205
Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,	 35.520462210691186
turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete	 71.08260261116848
victory over him, continued her triumph.	 54.385530889302395
"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for	 44.33546657507712
my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal	 37.28684507939
pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?"	 33.23024158297635
"When I am in the country," he replied, "I never wish to leave it; and	 27.910918260212092
when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their	 51.268783830871115
advantages, and I can be equally happy in either."	 69.62631257500888
"Aye--that is because you have the right disposition. But that	 22.118588110346394
gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing	 43.30320863537896
at all."	 47.76858931556188
"Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for her	 25.561587375064786
mother. "You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there were not	 56.685097068170066
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which	 30.107185256757397
you must acknowledge to be true."	 25.2012965593749
"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with	 52.77963882916206
many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few	 35.390692765569696
neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four and twenty families."	 28.235627299094066
Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his	 87.43992294510619
countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards	 36.67632999893621
Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of	 20.420822540387743
saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if	 73.368513715038
Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.	 20.211742445931577
"Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir	 44.46590948888974
William is, Mr. Bingley--is not he? so much the man of fashion! so	 105.99558696665
genteel and so easy!--He has always something to say to every	 38.62869785301793
body.--_That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy	 30.52538546243137
themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the	 65.32360859175034
matter."	 3809.5302808962356
"Did Charlotte dine with you?"	 35.993850431660455
"No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies. For	 51.34537531383972
my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own	 32.31821047457401
work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently. But every body is to	 47.16799904577476
judge for themselves, and the Lucases are very good sort of girls, I	 35.830423354681415
assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think	 40.67345703065877
Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend."	 58.29098950978702
"She seems a very pleasant young woman," said Bingley.	 30.85358718655028
"Oh! dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself	 51.91380385556805
has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty. I do not like to boast	 67.1215930553715
of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see any body	 32.91159365750978
better looking. It is what every body says. I do not trust my own	 16.848596522410666
partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my	 42.381744029597236
brother Gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my	 28.409443491493338
sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.	 24.94609764421266
But however he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he	 56.58772256419692
wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were."	 46.38724081086246
"And so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently. "There has	 62.02903603804765
been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first	 64.63028436815489
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"	 70.91467140569382
"I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love," said Darcy.	 22.433115109122056
"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Every thing nourishes what is	 62.52810975820611
strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I	 94.28285537038047
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."	 43.76199083412064
Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth	 45.22159695231071
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to	 28.658519087419503
speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.	 33.841072073793306
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to	 30.235528263558418
Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was	 56.407254554204165
unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be	 61.48638074723363
civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part	 101.08169322220691
indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and	 42.09205999559726
soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of	 46.26180610093619
her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to	 14.586654181352856
each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the	 28.137383064827123
youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming	 98.72203504256264
into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.	 29.44729860813011
Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion	 27.77805769344192
and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose	 44.63326217817563
affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high	 37.18761579311919
animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the	 35.42541036655167
attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own	 37.259956590945464
easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very	 39.56143686874354
equal therefore to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and	 31.33712262851979
abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most	 26.919366096498102
shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this	 44.384854451490305
sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear.	 31.270898358063523
"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when	 16.699198051434713
your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of	 34.77647775606237
the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill."	 35.573674731439475
Lydia declared herself satisfied. "Oh! yes--it would be much better to	 36.61274383988322
wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter	 81.09978746988214
would be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball," she	 43.63116302104384
added, "I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel	 64.65872976131901
Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not."	 24.666820807932314
Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned	 27.8093021048538
instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the	 32.27820324629127
remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,	 45.94486109347775
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of	 15.13109454441761
all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_.	 40.34233136555656
CHAPTER X.	 12.911953956184709
The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss	 36.412777437717345
Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who	 27.1271805264227
continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined	 35.833574180584435
their party in the drawing-room. The loo table, however, did not appear.	 22.08714218335683
Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching	 25.31731454207741
the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by	 36.11343967555934
messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and	 19.958260413483305
Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.	 43.72552933878212
Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in	 27.856652240621965
attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual	 35.86948979631428
commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness	 28.522862270247035
of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern	 36.698626186725676
with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was	 25.637769510083682
exactly in unison with her opinion of each.	 45.8048759602572
"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!"	 39.881839442595044
He made no answer.	 15.701992449615815
"You write uncommonly fast."	 40.218992418631515
"You are mistaken. I write rather slowly."	 16.677889454134196
"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the	 22.091422781632083
year! Letters of business too! How odious I should think them!"	 109.55667656168477
"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours."	 42.028930201770734
"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her."	 37.27637747073189
"I have already told her so once, by your desire."	 62.315866084155196
"I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend	 24.159218082826772
pens remarkably well."	 81.2684543279468
"Thank you--but I always mend my own."	 84.97733712820656
"How can you contrive to write so even?"	 45.610485058075604
He was silent.	 43.68194302362812
"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,	 25.452904489465297
and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful	 31.107408439421572
little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss	 50.09110722165787
Grantley's."	 8.776652323334677
"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?--At	 22.78470787337848
present I have not room to do them justice."	 52.61297031369183
"Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you	 33.006241970124016
always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?"	 60.1424451773599
"They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me	 60.25654781931501
to determine."	 147.1922397694238
"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with	 31.684257944939176
ease, cannot write ill."	 264.54894420815197
"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried her	 30.52119707975585
brother--"because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much for	 38.55466493498525
words of four syllables.--Do not you, Darcy?"	 307.72295445153014
"My style of writing is very different from yours."	 40.39097983128978
"Oh!" cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless way	 23.29706042756319
imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest."	 47.864070650246944
"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which	 39.82877752141106
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents."	 62.679049409453434
"Your humility, Mr. Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must disarm reproof."	 39.15625650564896
"Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance of	 30.055300647059592
humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an	 134.63705334025866
indirect boast."	 79.7344760707799
"And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?"	 76.990289081631
"The indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in	 24.51872703455246
writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of	 47.56916384933411
thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think	 34.22563102806605
at least highly interesting. The power of doing any thing with	 35.60729936829793
quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any	 27.159102173733302
attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.	 40.80243079744778
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield	 44.035166876877845
you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of	 28.17816765916912
panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very	 48.88101668616243
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business	 42.99322320586349
undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?"	 27.79974685463812
"Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the	 59.78769183519275
foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I	 39.076723142174416
believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this	 62.863938312289356
moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless	 26.66084168478886
precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies."	 34.07020409496407
"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you	 12.600919823971669
would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as	 36.18756870955633
dependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were	 69.33605906042011
mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay	 52.60989518775622
till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not	 31.1172569860402
go--and, at another word, might stay a month."	 64.64803287768521
"You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr. Bingley did	 52.17148403297262
not do justice to his own disposition. You have shewn him off now much	 47.381661133786594
more than he did himself."	 46.51800377805436
"I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting what my	 50.18603844887099
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am	 24.049971954362555
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means	 55.76675376272955
intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a	 48.0775618311523
circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I	 26.498353920136758
could."	 247.0437237934655
"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention	 39.24830006101291
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"	 41.60475494323961
"Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must speak for	 21.777615426006328
himself."	 543.2586490566042
"You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but	 32.25882135167349
which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to stand	 36.284098542433156
according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that	 28.85639690888573
the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the	 60.87234913877646
delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one	 46.35642661633983
argument in favour of its propriety."	 46.533204834721275
"To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit	 41.400187511474954
with you."	 68.28381329954935
"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of	 45.83297119338889
either."	 1270.2328776036275
"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of	 41.162432264376385
friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make	 106.88064312813374
one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason	 33.37297736388677
one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have	 30.613908448091696
supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the	 105.828466587001
circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour	 62.8062863341895
thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,	 49.92867939947841
where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no	 46.4183496210513
very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying	 44.705023751935855
with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"	 34.022462577752364
"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange	 28.946536179569602
with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to	 50.08710217359413
appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting	 17.797869266923946
between the parties?"	 78.3875205778577
"By all means," cried Bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not	 27.239340408406715
forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more	 32.63730812116146
weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure	 47.62615522843274
you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with	 28.000592195041982
myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not	 22.381048416662495
know a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in	 47.78066158499104
particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening	 40.26323176870077
when he has nothing to do."	 29.508015437086947
Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was	 15.18061137567015
rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly	 54.843818223134534
resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her	 20.004360782985497
brother for talking such nonsense.	 146.42568257146618
"I see your design, Bingley," said his friend.--"You dislike an	 73.55014181919249
argument, and want to silence this."	 116.39796289586147
"Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss	 45.33396771567544
Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very	 36.56506652463163
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."	 83.25885069108297
"What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.	 44.30714063943429
Darcy had much better finish his letter."	 61.5162716730128
Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.	 44.00566396804219
When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth	 28.616082927013828
for the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to	 16.519389116120472
the piano-forte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead	 32.36430714838565
the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she	 48.849435682595555
seated herself.	 602.1412864507403
Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed	 17.506956669011824
Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books	 22.07750839210585
that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed	 29.236558616857216
on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of	 23.438363155230714
admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because	 52.22335498699169
he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine however	 30.0446478552213
at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about	 53.152687631497294
her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than	 50.11169193743992
in any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked	 35.4644195327749
him too little to care for his approbation.	 41.61405298654009
After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a	 42.56341351510069
lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near	 53.92158194003663
Elizabeth, said to her--	 41.114251447936624
"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an	 32.99515603501057
opportunity of dancing a reel?"	 37.187155908657054
She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some	 32.28783018128333
surprise at her silence.	 192.59765802890442
"Oh!" said she, "I heard you before; but I could not immediately	 30.40043495702931
determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,'	 53.87259194810447
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always	 30.46827754469288
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of	 28.622804257762006
their premeditated contempt. I have therefore made up my mind to tell	 43.41774887184314
you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if	 46.64162942521591
you dare."	 138.43869276928953
"Indeed I do not dare."	 17.609737861598767
Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his	 29.055265270853926
gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her	 15.326190696146703
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had	 38.02710818296894
never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really	 49.01225637620357
believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he	 32.370067590229056
should be in some danger.	 37.85428434953802
Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great	 25.935579483990484
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane, received some	 39.23398041159519
assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.	 67.44162137318229
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of	 31.469302875550646
their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.	 34.326370909718044
"I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the	 16.177346970438176
next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this	 66.45815635478979
desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;	 14.577267707882651
and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after	 47.750160650206716
the officers.--And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to	 31.13322778941058
check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,	 78.39656138489549
which your lady possesses."	 122.51631859963076
"Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?"	 28.533802937551005
"Oh! yes.--Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be	 26.580130482342085
placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great uncle	 50.06430560897786
the judge. They are in the same profession, you know; only in different	 61.36671357225784
lines. As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it	 40.65452135725452
taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"	 51.775951088408746
"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their	 26.328541996245896
colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be	 41.57620525930171
copied."	 8.776652323334677
At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs. Hurst and	 31.69810294611884
Elizabeth herself.	 69.79644787698817
"I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in some	 25.445972786090792
confusion, lest they had been overheard.	 17.03932913135494
"You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs. Hurst, "in running away	 74.39678733598035
without telling us that you were coming out."	 51.61260706919539
Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk	 26.1208617620011
by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness	 101.0804741142971
and immediately said,--	 75.65073442272546
"This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the	 22.698491980528956
avenue."	 8.776652323334677
But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,	 27.097260740418307
laughingly answered,	 84.963279402596
"No, no; stay where you are.--You are charmingly group'd, and appear to	 40.2442420610878
uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a	 30.071931588226963
fourth. Good bye."	 35.38343579317968
She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of	 34.35615550523413
being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered	 36.47328550233335
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.	 36.15823675061105
CHAPTER XI.	 12.911953956184709
When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister,	 33.21631475248739
and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the	 40.2069592406907
drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many	 48.734565943204004
professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable	 23.049087606882054
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.	 42.96983589387204
Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an	 59.586291069432846
entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh	 68.03462352072515
at their acquaintance with spirit.	 53.00418846329815
But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object.	 33.911076836894715
Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had	 21.48160611103318
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed	 45.98966121886434
himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst	 32.155472667762126
also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness	 24.952631112891957
and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation. He was full of joy and	 43.674132817621135
attention. The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she	 16.83811613679922
should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to	 54.97070908228021
the other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the	 16.24900327058263
door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else.	 37.25703721315641
Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great	 49.368199695021346
delight.	 2021.951306616539
When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the	 18.691468860906134
card-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.	 36.48438583997859
Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open	 46.12648473387341
petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the	 16.983535606019828
silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her. Mr.	 23.458545511173963
Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the	 37.571848898723125
sophas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;	 46.4610067609474
and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and	 28.555264873639402
rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss	 60.03573439040089
Bennet.	 400.0597342633047
Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.	 19.958570058407563
Darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was	 34.12463528751015
perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She	 34.41319298837597
could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her	 48.910792221483575
question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be	 46.51936857535596
amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the	 19.59776419074893
second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "How pleasant it	 53.79778851660271
is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no	 34.56468607392118
enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a	 54.40358060617106
book!--When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not	 21.268476761548982
an excellent library."	 53.470339832982475
No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and	 48.39387913852549
cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing	 35.06904343830889
her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly	 22.6548218254159
towards him and said,	 49.810296966006824
"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at	 37.580362993698614
Netherfield?--I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult	 47.5481745687634
the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not	 16.47223089976807
some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a	 64.17942919654834
pleasure."	 744.4034853600544
"If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses,	 33.02174144364968
before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and	 46.662634118692615
as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my	 51.18821839144624
cards."	 6612.339934209026
"I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were	 39.6542017803068
carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably	 25.43943929324593
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much	 24.53427473999862
more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the	 29.693283690350526
day."	 1420.2102906013768
"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be	 15.701893171539307
near so much like a ball."	 77.38055936393971
Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about	 21.74112431493543
the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but Darcy, at	 85.6003204950716
whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation	 27.026252076063532
of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to	 41.4298438605362
Elizabeth, said,	 69.9579497452412
"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a	 25.807975137610434
turn about the room.--I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting	 43.795083313078095
so long in one attitude."	 115.18355045640155
Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley	 37.07601281748556
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked	 29.16404548810636
up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as	 29.447447594158973
Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was	 60.20643792741405
directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing,	 56.29431172570957
that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and	 32.44512276462065
down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them	 51.83966014657963
would interfere. "What could he mean? she was dying to know what could	 31.45333956210043
be his meaning"--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand	 56.56853090177085
him?	 219.2887829078639
"Not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe	 32.98997577597949
on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing	 63.672323046041505
about it."	 64.11715101350343
Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in any	 29.64258596501419
thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two	 43.967598066088456
motives.	 4703.756355612438
"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon	 15.06826933248365
as she allowed him to speak. "You either chuse this method of passing	 35.74325923737683
the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret	 58.450917320293016
affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures	 22.19947702136143
appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, I should be	 41.51339536274147
completely in your way;--and if the second, I can admire you much better	 72.10030400206564
as I sit by the fire."	 58.89781210718656
"Oh! shocking!" cried Miss Bingley. "I never heard any thing so	 20.17558776915424
abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?"	 128.3081197008024
"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said Elizabeth. "We	 67.29850190885348
can all plague and punish one another. Teaze him--laugh at	 61.22182002762591
him.--Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done."	 17.114866852636215
"But upon my honour I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has not	 14.758333164099188
yet taught me _that_. Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind! No,	 37.58673946897643
no--I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose	 41.42300534992951
ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr.	 46.84012681207982
Darcy may hug himself."	 133.98045381385245
"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried Elizabeth. "That is an	 19.73531324280596
uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would	 46.81282408684757
be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance. I dearly love a	 41.98167894712228
laugh."	 2433.337542463338
"Miss Bingley," said he, "has given me credit for more than can be. The	 20.247082619833485
wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions,	 32.989643555722566
may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a	 33.16790480323027
joke."	 8.776652323334677
"Certainly," replied Elizabeth--"there are such people, but I hope I am	 41.190540532220794
not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good. Follies	 38.42433503315619
and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, I own, and I	 34.86688154470442
laugh at them whenever I can.--But these, I suppose, are precisely what	 115.24230665342013
you are without."	 182.14443129532705
"Perhaps that is not possible for any one. But it has been the study of	 30.175807000309472
my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong	 74.26452022424127
understanding to ridicule."	 48.84000503346166
"Such as vanity and pride."	 99.73390703631411
"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real	 35.080349826536114
superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."	 32.68599486745838
Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.	 22.68052913193396
"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss	 24.01099686113467
Bingley;--"and pray what is the result?"	 37.62791213189289
"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it	 25.367016490639834
himself without disguise."	 66.22884060102386
"No"--said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,	 22.146166240127144
but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch	 29.528417853168456
for.--It is I believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the	 31.841932929085512
convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of	 15.178454008962117
others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself. My	 69.33232167370677
feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper	 34.33936301737754
would perhaps be called resentful.--My good opinion once lost is lost	 102.33505400283521
for ever."	 131.5831729147483
"_That_ is a failing indeed!"--cried Elizabeth. "Implacable resentment	 47.12255306099256
_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well.--I	 37.6896051688893
really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me."	 48.329242614857215
"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular	 65.70352168458726
evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome."	 108.30393217263175
"And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body."	 32.842220807220066
"And yours," he replied with a smile, "is wilfully to misunderstand	 33.817194657947454
them."	 292.3017873216418
"Do let us have a little music,"--cried Miss Bingley, tired of a	 26.88983601989191
conversation in which she had no share.--"Louisa, you will not mind my	 27.64506779096684
waking Mr. Hurst."	 44.68919721569024
Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was	 22.460852136185476
opened, and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for	 26.04194542909592
it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.	 34.16124636627988
CHAPTER XII.	 12.911953956184709
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the	 44.70100864781464
next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for	 23.26250552252187
them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on	 15.677353963295603
her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which	 21.96859030428602
would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive	 89.56438896326165
them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at	 56.12495170089229
least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.	 40.83309405823346
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage	 52.56076071863079
before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley	 26.930911366086008
and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very	 42.89830464870837
well.--Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively	 60.27508375268071
resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the	 28.006961319932742
contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,	 183.73842378404103
she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at	 36.00183969166298
length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield	 52.296344469800324
that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.	 93.91414728911398
The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was	 45.36504530591915
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on	 41.0120443937574
Jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was	 44.41561246575042
then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike	 30.40883673622805
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.	 60.11303433865093
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so	 31.89416603289858
soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be	 32.172300446756594
safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where	 41.237547718522684
she felt herself to be right.	 30.110067861604737
To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at	 32.78063373893828
Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss	 65.07453650815162
Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teazing than usual to himself.	 22.308616418956802
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration	 38.715253031129905
should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of	 38.45836383471996
influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been	 34.3702379764258
suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight	 25.63124614472857
in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke	 41.897595875182255
ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at	 54.373008624190945
one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most	 54.288552302264
conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.	 24.509976842391335
On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost	 98.76506270169483
all, took place. Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last	 30.00108470193134
very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,	 17.29478451756818
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to	 48.783882983675326
see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most	 55.872345397265356
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former.--Elizabeth took leave of	 21.211973007266412
the whole party in the liveliest spirits.	 19.47747440293542
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet	 24.14159068741929
wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much	 75.97737490718303
trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again.--But their	 55.93193887969931
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really	 57.508441805982265
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The	 30.699030897383352
evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its	 41.693956181929664
animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and	 55.31148427068949
Elizabeth.	 72.33142332012484
They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human	 26.03278140859512
nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations	 55.57803976518237
of thread-bare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had	 22.127321255771758
information for them of a different sort. Much had been done, and much	 97.8999850511723
had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of	 33.458069562286454
the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been	 48.53002771581769
flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going	 27.140366448221513
to be married.	 32.721204549158685
CHAPTER XIII.	 12.911953956184709
"I hope, my dear," said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at	 13.860167296084413
breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,	 33.20032918947018
because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party."	 44.02363303995028
"Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming I am sure,	 31.60940909159276
unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in, and I hope _my_ dinners	 36.00496834809572
are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home."	 24.333683615751113
"The person of whom I speak, is a gentleman and a stranger." Mrs.	 62.296175508782675
Bennet's eyes sparkled.--"A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr. Bingley	 81.73046654287515
I am sure. Why Jane--you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing!	 38.511582291437804
Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley.--But--good	 12.313048471442363
lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day. Lydia,	 25.453649735685726
my love, ring the bell. I must speak to Hill, this moment."	 31.300809007691438
"It is _not_ Mr. Bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom I	 21.17406796069761
never saw in the whole course of my life."	 22.19960151600625
This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being	 41.77024214637305
eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.	 44.21660038512433
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained.	 60.50713270027246
"About a month ago I received this letter, and about a fortnight ago I	 32.367279122187675
answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring	 93.73420970140292
early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead,	 38.963237062677344
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases."	 23.815256808184802
"Oh! my dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.	 17.92707694557666
Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing	 27.800392328612652
in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own	 20.569842736577584
children; and I am sure if I had been you, I should have tried long ago	 26.74041751908998
to do something or other about it."	 68.71082516335036
Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.	 37.7696688315719
They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs.	 21.339400570996514
Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail	 18.207361743133525
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of	 23.333633248562325
five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.	 22.405219807628896
"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Mr. Bennet, "and	 16.102944345595297
nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.	 26.074462562566257
But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little	 23.73278920056482
softened by his manner of expressing himself."	 56.19668878369647
"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it was very impertinent of	 22.78116148624513
him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false	 32.94558518425344
friends. Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father	 67.8225547359292
did before him?"	 145.83867291651637
"Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that	 41.62801179033272
head, as you will hear."	 42.23078131450601
_Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent,	 266.6780561024086
15th October._	 10.85925182058365
DEAR SIR,	 117.4245714297951
The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured	 31.502408233400462
father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the	 57.8065637364782
misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the	 19.42202898859145
breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing	 20.314352553350997
lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good	 47.3538550825851
terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at	 72.65140279359713
variance.--"There, Mrs. Bennet."--My mind however is now made up on	 95.83759269016527
the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been	 60.91930193277158
so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right	 18.982596879336246
Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh,	 21.936535848455623
whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable	 63.86309025014744
rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to	 19.15127703446245
demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be	 40.08438842358894
ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are	 38.766163803713155
instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I	 28.880595238179072
feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in	 19.49426319448307
all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds	 27.653333114204134
I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly	 26.4162252543461
commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the	 26.61905197654432
entail of Longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side,	 34.45014310174345
and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch. I cannot be	 29.339325116579538
otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your	 50.606763590972484
amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to	 22.989970918162342
assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but	 34.86202934996671
of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to receive me	 19.7667401659978
into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on	 70.18105256961485
you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and	 37.59968386232197
shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday	 62.139302604607124
se'night following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as	 48.54497629697297
Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a	 27.704969349667778
Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the	 31.334283064511634
duty of the day. I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to	 44.157139962239434
your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,	 124.15559249366636
WILLIAM COLLINS."	 624.0426917062881
"At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,"	 154.8885086212199
said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. "He seems to be a most	 28.377467226704415
conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and I doubt not will	 33.37296955515063
prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so	 34.76095327998223
indulgent as to let him come to us again."	 44.42496640289662
"There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he	 42.51428295320233
is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to	 24.45170362729405
discourage him."	 36.35125313992519
"Though it is difficult," said Jane, "to guess in what way he can mean	 43.77546915092121
to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his	 90.48830435613395
credit."	 2187.4061340657167
Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady	 28.728856987274725
Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying	 42.2696803220185
his parishioners whenever it were required.	 81.15940009893556
"He must be an oddity, I think," said she. "I cannot make him	 23.77628945596991
out.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he	 32.39926049198114
mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he	 49.91926239751539
would help it, if he could.--Can he be a sensible man, sir?"	 52.17025522019671
"No, my dear; I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the	 32.41073419506743
reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his	 11.351815470028148
letter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him."	 35.19996409430539
"In point of composition," said Mary, "his letter does not seem	 64.47087338844716
defective. The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I	 26.55641672732584
think it is well expressed."	 67.1447195884695
To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any	 53.06936131477888
degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should	 57.281622839287714
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had	 30.380780532941355
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for	 26.662542070780265
their mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will,	 46.93990873881039
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which	 14.672363386567785
astonished her husband and daughters.	 184.8680322171832
Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great	 25.66354058302522
politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the	 63.280500813737476
ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need	 42.471768067241456
of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall,	 26.44851902205372
heavy looking young man of five and twenty. His air was grave and	 87.78938537326601
stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated	 13.822225942034484
before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of	 53.179951965729806
daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this	 36.581909532364584
instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did	 57.804959912994846
not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.	 115.2312111026736
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but	 29.437854741547394
Mrs. Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,	 46.51799120809998
"You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may	 24.404235187590313
prove so; for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so	 88.07619389805782
oddly."	 8.776652323334677
"You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate."	 26.801102662849075
"Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you	 32.63355102634389
must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things	 39.590223248151325
I know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates	 33.08985364899796
will go when once they come to be entailed."	 111.67881396758538
"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and	 15.778778940641606
could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing	 40.010040452697744
forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come	 46.468323085792065
prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more, but perhaps	 37.74659713875803
when we are better acquainted----"	 27.32583672780235
He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each	 21.503734126375704
other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration. The	 30.82742306307619
hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised;	 44.052555123630036
and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs. Bennet's	 27.866762960700044
heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his	 38.896147006858236
own future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and	 47.8425896868362
he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its	 36.34104179664616
cookery was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured	 31.360992490166108
him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good	 24.682402971045498
cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged	 19.833411948983052
pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared	 35.743312099165315
herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a	 36.9915746395673
quarter of an hour.	 57.63920481515392
CHAPTER XIV.	 12.911953956184709
During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants	 55.68908992124246
were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his	 32.293779925113014
guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to	 22.51858870312113
shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady	 26.292158319414156
Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his	 46.71530503759498
comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen	 59.82896605589699
better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him	 51.220056048082874
to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect	 14.778735875852576
he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a	 32.48064073000781
person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself	 43.537578054029396
experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to	 27.874824137221726
approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of	 20.90877007682537
preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,	 23.288680299113487
and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of	 41.5796279196012
quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many	 30.779542185373163
people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her.	 31.556266808822436
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she	 42.07996264398227
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the	 19.138971888924875
neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or	 50.87518146899429
two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to	 66.52238051754738
marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had	 26.95182213637451
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly	 56.93134310483216
approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed	 29.330902449257355
to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs.	 20.46354997635349
"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," said Mrs. Bennet, "and I	 19.499853511285565
dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies	 24.328185606871244
in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?"	 73.41205901707457
"The garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane	 39.251584339959486
from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence."	 33.32098105401746
"I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?"	 122.39012366625369
"She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very	 64.02095698490031
extensive property."	 87.58659652168896
"Ah!" cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than	 45.42664126821654
many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? is she handsome?"	 50.85012230969153
"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says	 29.54277281085313
that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the	 31.456906505393736
handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks	 23.545990346304603
the young woman of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly	 30.995417091888815
constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many	 70.36293963412693
accomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as I am	 22.508933611334708
informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still	 41.34303489222792
resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends	 25.21708548271474
to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies."	 17.99119400923323
"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at	 36.25349386311174
court."	 8.776652323334677
"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;	 28.491758282925886
and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived	 61.70099784433045
the British court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased	 14.461395325906365
with the idea, and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to	 23.51549219642873
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to	 96.50959342005393
ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her	 36.80970099139325
charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most	 40.388766649733554
elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by	 25.102311791715913
her.--These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and	 36.83055200524335
it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to	 18.36947158671524
pay."	 8761.556508485495
"You judge very properly," said Mr. Bennet, "and it is happy for you	 36.13202062585826
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask	 32.35870209283218
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the	 15.361573884703198
moment, or are the result of previous study?"	 86.61304267590165
"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I	 34.29594105946035
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant	 47.90620140807717
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to	 32.00608792053234
give them as unstudied an air as possible."	 55.27790665107327
Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd	 41.03383171153613
as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,	 21.517645491555474
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,	 20.849604448879802
and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in	 51.14825417258136
his pleasure.	 380.90062833172396
By tea-time however the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad to	 31.26495299972192
take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad	 31.60714942191747
to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented,	 24.285029038184646
and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced	 39.673057743135054
it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging	 33.322780559379375
pardon, protested that he never read novels.--Kitty stared at him, and	 36.35330275969119
Lydia exclaimed.--Other books were produced, and after some deliberation	 57.252694026505814
he chose Fordyce's Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and	 50.7572114565834
before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she	 64.12292262839128
interrupted him with,	 85.87762552575036
"Do you know, mama, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard,	 29.84871370031339
and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me so	 29.43013076103391
herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more	 43.08779122087892
about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town."	 30.49914485848386
Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.	 28.487172132685224
Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,	 66.98417268362809
"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books	 26.858387975866304
of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes	 41.856964471194594
me, I confess;--for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to	 45.231502982457336
them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin."	 38.955665436013824
Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at	 35.148799433532524
backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted	 22.545778401783597
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs.	 44.25623663366575
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's	 45.267604562256665
interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would	 48.50957552456412
resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his	 32.24220417937179
young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any	 193.10552259221802
affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared	 57.19499390023758
for backgammon.	 69.07641118507995
CHAPTER XV.	 12.911953956184709
Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had	 15.166815797212811
been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of	 53.89755471168722
his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and	 29.590357985725202
miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he	 25.569966128408172
had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful	 56.44870401650694
acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had	 28.973544699024384
given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good	 27.762370750298448
deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in	 27.303456774730236
retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected	 47.031431356160546
prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de	 25.770816448407626
Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he	 48.30487501294337
felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,	 55.715491686989914
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a	 24.485083693321705
clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of	 39.33009755916502
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.	 51.71705466259177
Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to	 26.84258765791975
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had	 30.50129084383676
a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found	 47.5894054719058
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.	 46.443406435179995
This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's	 40.79333563777251
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and	 34.57245915952692
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own	 23.612465672738622
part.	 1462.9705275615784
His plan did not vary on seeing them.--Miss Bennet's lovely face	 36.22411787841462
confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what	 35.99844267738717
was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled	 42.139467234883476
choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter	 53.184478545116846
of an hour's tête-à-tête with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a	 79.02886714846409
conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally	 37.916370053367444
to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at	 36.225122301747874
Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general	 37.77414109084578
encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.--"As to	 63.5519099628535
her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say--she could	 41.667781998909525
not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her	 25.6609652298577
_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her	 61.893695722696464
to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged."	 36.96918242169615
Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon	 38.29346589163393
done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally	 27.140426778646667
next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.	 50.613113136881374
Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have	 23.294400299230773
two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of	 18.489777630457986
the day before, was now high in her good graces.	 33.06126243115661
Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister	 64.24690850659425
except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,	 25.01826812960181
at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,	 26.268090782778668
and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed	 79.91621788659623
him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with	 80.44575052290014
one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.	 21.444725691748154
Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such	 55.48444390958186
doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been	 22.92382959726478
always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told	 48.789122725036854
Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the	 28.531682040658616
house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,	 60.72115858058964
was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their	 38.666976041587176
walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker	 27.9606822144013
than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and	 43.09828105694947
go.	 1446.3870973879716
In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his	 31.674845277558383
cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of	 75.50974180967644
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_. Their eyes	 39.24655788855789
were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers,	 29.91606538714595
and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin	 26.305512023990982
in a shop window, could recal them.	 27.708792252524127
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom	 23.766947721905684
they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking	 34.59191544334505
with an officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very	 20.17039076800559
Mr. Denny, concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire,	 32.44657258042173
and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger's air,	 40.13997798914209
all wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if	 127.56839719647931
possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of	 32.757330505616316
wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained	 27.729215765120905
the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same	 15.472474714591018
spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to	 25.206577566385427
introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day	 36.478169790852796
before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in	 57.61563758748321
their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted	 27.728665835325078
only regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was	 61.847470501458055
greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine	 53.27892715045411
countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction	 53.802793556592285
was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a	 33.75084516402724
readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the	 12.007503361890349
whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,	 43.344053437324085
when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were	 50.815862366698724
seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group,	 49.281299174279496
the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual	 30.12839670740214
civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the	 30.52285928399824
principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on	 72.35278118556583
purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and	 28.96665872296121
was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they	 40.36774340505977
were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth	 27.200204866740897
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,	 26.039196107046926
was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,	 18.19560656769002
one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments,	 23.390338629001786
touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.	 40.383202812031605
What could be the meaning of it?--It was impossible to imagine; it was	 35.17305696746619
impossible not to long to know.	 87.590993088848
In another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what	 37.53978868711387
passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.	 79.57037323477896
Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of	 27.53616131505758
Mr. Philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's	 51.27848827455952
pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.	 33.75720170705286
Philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the	 32.11175917523234
invitation.	 2809.5209115476605
Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from	 13.832239234951661
their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly	 33.61731536145992
expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own	 75.3218068495579
carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if	 78.11621745150859
she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop boy in the street, who had	 26.49076873830823
told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield	 29.482498015687966
because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed	 46.04704267989157
towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him. She received him with	 56.9762774605662
her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,	 48.89533871972946
apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with	 16.262619379762377
her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be	 22.092824651490638
justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to	 17.332885918596702
her notice. Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good	 27.36533851396025
breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to	 25.52008164764101
by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she	 46.50083615316734
could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had	 45.25365674839295
brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's	 22.849870860111825
commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the last hour,	 21.685962487113827
she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr. Wickham	 33.86964991461957
appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation,	 28.199520339148062
but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the	 35.331592659722496
officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid,	 56.909202566461815
disagreeable fellows." Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the	 24.447106337426323
next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.	 35.812985040075084
Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn	 84.9499739639476
would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Philips	 44.74599734498609
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery	 31.949657719286144
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such	 19.058113117105364
delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.	 32.173357155003686
Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured	 33.47486468662876
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.	 29.83235583423372
As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass	 20.574819673394476
between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or	 37.06214953995347
both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such	 44.90526261801939
behaviour than her sister.	 71.39538845693902
Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs.	 30.30890350710241
Philips's manners and politeness. He protested that except Lady	 52.52600503592933
Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for	 17.310287993314212
she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even	 38.968223331950476
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although	 29.091297674251017
utterly unknown to her before. Something he supposed might be attributed	 74.60210183263938
to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much	 22.1294997440891
attention in the whole course of his life.	 20.651553229132247
CHAPTER XVI.	 12.911953956184709
As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their	 51.098326810902094
aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for	 59.28397128289323
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach	 41.420307429268554
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the	 38.30298909239378
girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,	 22.207134838919576
that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in	 25.010993108066593
the house.	 41.77615155782918
When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.	 38.85887111962495
Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much	 33.64255172418899
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he	 21.080988471151972
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour	 35.211478846930596
at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much	 48.929404919672976
gratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings	 34.253037684587355
was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the	 37.49677280267212
description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found	 36.51670663429923
that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all	 50.66619195558115
the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison	 50.55406210792086
with the housekeeper's room.	 31.108825279835305
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,	 14.916714813340375
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the	 24.797636456733613
improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the	 32.56572353152399
gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive	 44.27282135016041
listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she	 24.3170409394764
heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as	 34.064156004459186
soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,	 24.46918046778722
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine	 27.644587243661505
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the	 26.054616911059078
interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last however. The	 38.17257008358071
gentlemen did approach; and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,	 24.102741410111573
Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking	 24.50792173061099
of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The	 33.957478938286734
officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,	 41.92329542597621
gentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but	 46.33823125764331
Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and	 34.724719788198605
walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,	 37.82686804347295
breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.	 16.90742285444712
Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was	 19.98565977749946
turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated	 35.29020068267219
himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into	 34.06916370251316
conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the	 38.58672420091831
probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,	 27.487289906521784
dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the	 18.016500356843466
skill of the speaker.	 7.303918356018697
With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr. Wickham and the	 27.038813073463928
officers, Mr. Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the	 22.195664371165073
young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a	 38.31075329072356
kind listener in Mrs. Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most	 43.721026433207484
abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.	 13.744739286383764
When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her	 20.159308361029876
in return, by sitting down to whist.	 35.54258413956695
"I know little of the game, at present," said he, "but I shall be glad	 33.99005829183796
to improve myself, for in my situation of life----" Mrs. Philips was	 32.97019625843565
very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.	 51.746553236997386
Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he	 30.28318967739144
received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there	 42.284625718892734
seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most	 45.11462435471631
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,	 21.199459792931673
she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets	 47.51923132118334
and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in	 46.66550340514187
particular. Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was	 27.549824241241488
therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to	 27.227260525612866
hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to	 42.51851484523481
be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not	 17.376705347873138
even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity however was unexpectedly	 51.996022743668235
relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far	 57.01987808361751
Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in	 69.97654782557443
an hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.	 44.053291042710626
"About a month," said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject	 31.608957598734005
drop, added, "He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I	 21.821177805320094
understand."	 3744.590232124949
"Yes," replied Wickham;--"his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten	 161.47092513939674
thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of	 26.2747444894219
giving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been	 33.865961434505984
connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy."	 53.01059983820272
Elizabeth could not but look surprised.	 29.087780543633933
"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after	 43.1929552416405
seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting	 134.4310621171711
yesterday.--Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?"	 24.733644278607027
"As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth warmly,--"I have spent	 27.615652336114465
four days in the same house with him, and I think him very	 30.67494657133502
disagreeable."	 1974.0752064033145
"I have no right to give _my_ opinion," said Wickham, "as to his being	 23.571704094332624
agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him	 36.46361168767278
too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_ to	 24.453669267103905
be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general	 41.622742531986866
astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly	 30.284001322763082
anywhere else.--Here you are in your own family."	 18.813840119664544
"Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the	 18.493552888177675
neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in	 30.099294093469915
Hertfordshire. Every body is disgusted with his pride. You will not find	 28.70931580554644
him more favourably spoken of by any one."	 76.16531291336483
"I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short	 23.769943541221565
interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond	 57.77832911632723
their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The	 21.140389397274717
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his	 45.324815477829276
high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen."	 46.73181879559272
"I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an	 50.972329963665075
ill-tempered man." Wickham only shook his head.	 64.05028149147238
"I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is	 25.50490219513486
likely to be in this country much longer."	 37.489977961491675
"I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I	 18.719409324511293
was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will	 36.03972942218932
not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood."	 34.04228909047366
"Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_	 16.69625842200572
wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on friendly terms,	 46.564778869559454
and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for	 16.115119640959023
avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world; a sense of	 29.42687322224338
very great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.	 31.382662287938995
His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men	 31.91299079947603
that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be	 43.49710050972325
in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a	 34.24518748797185
thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been	 81.8615336012084
scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every	 25.874111551300423
thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory	 63.060886259224226
of his father."	 37.70468815360697
Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with	 36.59452292045599
all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.	 46.81340679047834
Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the	 43.920071544242106
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he	 27.2005142332528
had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but	 48.8324742925103
very intelligible gallantry.	 60.66564293085774
"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added,	 43.733783723424864
"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I knew it to be a	 36.09941633460657
most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me	 32.107415004087926
farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great	 38.12378852769902
attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.	 79.70241584806838
Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and	 39.585040544436694
my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.	 54.346685799935145
A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have	 63.98950578300994
now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I	 31.123566202725197
was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in	 22.921145255264094
possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we	 73.73740611199524
were speaking of just now."	 88.11165260755782
"Indeed!"	 546.1473961954408
"Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best	 18.41009704112018
living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.	 29.810075983611046
I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,	 22.86832068422868
and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given	 34.85476205203936
elsewhere."	 8.776652323334677
"Good heavens!" cried Elizabeth; "but how could _that_ be?--How could	 71.55937662441514
his will be disregarded?--Why did not you seek legal redress?"	 27.754102386039403
"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to	 20.635264771522955
give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the	 38.07888182852648
intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely	 70.94581970325973
conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim	 27.118842736594576
to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.	 89.46190468551411
Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I	 25.68111284949219
was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no	 39.344642097348675
less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done	 45.874051734635295
any thing to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I	 34.12433338051586
may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too	 23.16943661224006
freely. I can recal nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very	 32.38526602430311
different sort of men, and that he hates me."	 29.402218716111395
"This is quite shocking!--He deserves to be publicly disgraced."	 21.116602501046398
"Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I	 30.331544070444757
can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_."	 38.45880920092656
Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than	 67.11112127551465
ever as he expressed them.	 65.3654302376514
"But what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive?--what	 25.36847871897284
can have induced him to behave so cruelly?"	 26.554200416869335
"A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but	 38.81190388911851
attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me	 28.456204395335714
less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon	 58.91442796633541
attachment to me, irritated him I believe very early in life. He had not	 29.009798136285433
a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of	 38.255915070721926
preference which was often given me."	 59.51443700564941
"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked	 20.36254443782426
him, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be	 27.389515860652995
despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of	 24.932940626021136
descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as	 20.20544863159626
this!"	 179.3298871670305
After a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, "I _do_ remember	 24.992420550073952
his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his	 24.335466639398877
resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition must	 34.425631018264184
be dreadful."	 156.50291479231782
"I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham, "_I_ can	 17.190188795863065
hardly be just to him."	 137.72317718393327
Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "To	 27.652761544362708
treat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his	 47.134997380553685
father!"--She could have added, "A young man too, like _you_, whose very	 34.67240178405831
countenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but she contented	 53.7075522942665
herself with "And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from	 61.38125917890856
childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest	 28.030709732320865
manner!"	 1199.7215049482604
"We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest	 23.07416892281919
part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,	 29.74088603326834
sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_	 51.62328351488501
father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips,	 78.83164468192473
appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use	 55.25178009830282
to the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the	 18.93344747710076
Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most	 26.901457703675877
intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to	 51.21914176694053
be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance,	 31.365880101473874
and when immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a	 24.351736201682808
voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to	 20.120444523247905
be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself."	 57.47815908654011
"How strange!" cried Elizabeth. "How abominable!--I wonder that the very	 43.36462321851448
pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you!--If from no better	 52.37528253970841
motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for	 15.034234607149264
dishonesty I must call it."	 28.67975761206469
"It _is_ wonderful,"--replied Wickham,--"for almost all his actions may	 45.051199028383365
be traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend. It has	 45.18069730365532
connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are none	 47.87469700874339
of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger	 28.009857213463707
impulses even than pride."	 108.96021098133652
"Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?"	 112.95553031142427
"Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his	 32.62328123733523
money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve	 18.5088514504404
the poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what	 39.877236341241186
his father was, have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to	 87.52192404063045
degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the	 16.244615666484542
Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,	 37.41068950727292
which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful	 28.413448323946213
guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the	 24.62158767345567
most attentive and best of brothers."	 80.86926737514143
"What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?"	 22.478138361733212
He shook his head.--"I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain	 64.2954145295988
to speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother,--very,	 23.837462703066404
very proud.--As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and	 57.77181066753158
extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her	 42.8888623763542
amusement. But she is nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about	 31.25363524022024
fifteen or sixteen, and I understand highly accomplished. Since her	 29.163876336947496
father's death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her,	 38.48123960439626
and superintends her education."	 35.103903759245895
After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not	 32.67022060868913
help reverting once more to the first, and saying,	 151.72243790951367
"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley,	 27.945112744171897
who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,	 27.977940213342933
be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other?--Do you	 28.996405233874693
know Mr. Bingley?"	 70.60455356846066
"Not at all."	 21.190918361127586
"He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.	 36.63433084502044
Darcy is."	 67.72182511515118
"Probably not;--but Mr. Darcy can please where he chuses. He does not	 37.56170280037167
want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth	 39.16956414855791
his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a	 39.55628084155918
very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride	 50.77788710963907
never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just,	 64.22766961301112
sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,--allowing	 62.49308252653191
something for fortune and figure."	 219.99716785900165
The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round	 32.211244235209435
the other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin	 27.7296497633066
Elizabeth and Mrs. Philips.--The usual inquiries as to his success were	 42.90547832015142
made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point;	 53.19985631169899
but when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured	 35.714657554081214
her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance,	 27.46144534736656
that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not	 30.49601042054045
make herself uneasy.	 89.83612766588259
"I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a	 20.473387544867496
card table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I	 40.27573811568802
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There	 61.01612525634271
are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady	 62.24058268307785
Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding	 15.007147984271864
little matters."	 173.96863106086857
Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for	 31.52987928086456
a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation	 25.251487905804687
were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.	 20.879643788994606
"Lady Catherine de Bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a	 19.54865964852729
living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her	 31.23863063475605
notice, but he certainly has not known her long."	 82.11388486782413
"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy	 32.29783997886768
were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy."	 43.457781602865424
"No, indeed, I did not.--I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's	 56.51468215917317
connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before	 39.872959135095165
yesterday."	 14009.341549002183
"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is	 18.30943419943452
believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates."	 43.25663104669832
This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss	 77.68169166144433
Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her	 86.38479515207852
affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already	 39.76977607402999
self-destined to another.	 47.552797155641706
"Mr. Collins," said she, "speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her	 44.681768336992775
daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,	 63.23810168059034
I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his	 43.457130456187365
patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman."	 52.38496135590442
"I believe her to be both in a great degree," replied Wickham; "I have	 19.153770083742558
not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked	 21.1776256292782
her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the	 26.917055156872465
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe	 30.23584359364125
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from	 49.53875546651207
her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who	 37.89090325658031
chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of	 51.99828767582527
the first class."	 33.12669962339932
Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and	 30.722034226359344
they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put	 38.19162762209276
an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.	 21.7157622907211
Wickham's attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of	 23.991432613112273
Mrs. Philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every	 44.473796263145346
body. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done	 137.90154827334118
gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could	 18.93691319862818
think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all	 28.435470793048797
the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as	 33.65996261354166
they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia	 100.99678323012495
talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the	 30.176585978801853
fish she had won, and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and	 36.56630810697772
Mrs. Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses	 33.0644783589735
at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing	 36.06729700721449
that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage	 43.82129540988373
before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.	 20.896366867994352
CHAPTER XVII.	 12.911953956184709
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day, what had passed between Mr.	 17.125286262371798
Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she	 39.098802169719406
knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.	 24.100553028395325
Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the	 30.33024404148621
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham.--The	 14.997684165678322
possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to	 40.38336470300951
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be	 63.92011728902561
done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and	 38.941953315692935
throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be	 39.24121027403607
otherwise explained.	 90.44400343812096
"They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, in some way or	 34.562048824097
other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps	 52.93653290941439
misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to	 35.117799885534346
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,	 33.53159668915253
without actual blame on either side."	 36.22647468657407
"Very true, indeed;--and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in	 34.36008725844574
behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the	 11.97577783492583
business?--Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of	 30.10040263926878
somebody."	 2762.733748111059
"Laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my	 23.466325569385603
opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light	 39.2656229360757
it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a	 35.24898577813558
manner,--one, whom his father had promised to provide for.--It is	 39.57563513436715
impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his	 60.19422067202208
character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so	 65.96906728752923
excessively deceived in him? oh! no."	 55.664304267850525
"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than	 46.80142880829922
that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me	 22.72213570672391
last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony.--If it	 28.477532451605597
be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his	 60.007701667812256
looks."	 2740.07090489856
"It is difficult indeed--it is distressing.--One does not know what to	 22.867618656372013
think."	 907.8524435790247
"I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think."	 25.55821295399788
But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr.	 71.36300445693092
Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the	 41.965968101803945
affair became public.	 413.92789037421795
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this	 19.846406365292392
conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom	 34.212631134896164
they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their	 39.77060841918176
personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was	 57.561931424972165
fixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see	 30.03896449418498
their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and	 40.41526338862597
repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their	 56.4946808882403
separation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention;	 36.70084024872634
avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth,	 29.56426052560573
and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from	 33.12811868756085
their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and	 35.584354097127324
hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities.	 42.551034455527876
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every	 23.74822602528236
female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in	 38.81671157029941
compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by	 24.31620821331995
receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a	 38.330234921508485
ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the	 43.09453919313288
society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and	 26.020517746074596
Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.	 64.39311775438844
Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr. Darcy's	 31.09471029439964
looks and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia,	 82.0552632336054
depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though	 44.20652356796963
they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr.	 76.81593348620748
Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and	 29.72254628763822
a ball was at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family	 63.44499303976609
that she had no disinclination for it.	 22.864113871758192
"While I can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough.--I	 38.56122533936413
think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.	 67.50595650395569
Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who	 48.007056381139826
consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every	 76.08166539643625
body."	 1802.601955491761
Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did	 35.67565381075247
not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking	 18.91293342384137
him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if he	 30.418729549697215
did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's	 39.68360639915677
amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no	 22.737383658038087
scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke	 29.30048208870188
either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to	 19.799372099690913
dance.	 1840.0404837693914
"I am by no means of opinion, I assure you," said he, "that a ball of	 20.43224491404762
this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can	 34.84573721358167
have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself	 32.94122875191294
that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins	 11.404663142333114
in the course of the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting	 18.059728079389007
yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a	 41.82318118678057
preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right	 38.628483456240446
cause, and not to any disrespect for her."	 56.229088536114574
Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being	 57.17780556849624
engaged by Wickham for those very dances:--and to have Mr. Collins	 60.4962623289245
instead! her liveliness had been never worse timed. There was no help	 59.395144570151025
for it however. Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own was per force	 61.78599215814741
delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as	 41.57318487313472
good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his	 33.617440500541875
gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.--It now first	 131.34768970679414
struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of	 28.040642738313817
being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a	 29.765317151219932
quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.	 44.37080569020121
The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing	 68.1642646901352
civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a	 72.12162094426901
compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than	 31.04596858469619
gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before	 28.025216329821994
her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage	 21.058895883712292
was exceedingly agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth however did not chuse to	 33.51327361931421
take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the	 61.13314738770608
consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and	 59.376339031789485
till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.	 42.951719823789055
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the	 32.57598861729453
younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time,	 25.008417936658844
for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was	 28.856147535043867
such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No	 65.70278577882719
aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;--the very shoe-roses	 63.089023684767284
for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some	 41.513026250586826
trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the	 19.87297796302819
improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than	 16.422948842631875
a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and	 31.44209808273155
Monday, endurable to Kitty and Lydia.	 58.00568150333888
CHAPTER XVIII.	 12.911953956184709
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in	 54.93815430428398
vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a	 34.702440491352434
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of	 22.631803370317233
meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that	 31.324304949054422
might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than	 42.29809487154394
usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all	 30.98489365916875
that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than	 30.32981577313297
might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the	 18.54079410858725
dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's	 35.69053658641184
pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this	 33.36700849963541
was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was	 28.246439884159532
pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and	 45.09458751209913
who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business	 27.32116226225789
the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant	 19.61917163819671
smile,	 8602.587385058287
"I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if	 29.556694803167925
he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here."	 38.00867935530047
This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by	 33.860120929570726
Elizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for	 41.67808515628763
Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling	 118.57722503631845
of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate	 26.84415467104463
disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to	 21.593358725521036
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to	 26.444570699753783
make.--Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to	 33.12502108393715
Wickham. She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and	 28.351965091722366
turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly	 14.193044068804184
surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality	 35.7507229239399
provoked her.	 25.673099276579286
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect	 30.734106206718337
of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her	 26.683174529745187
spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had	 30.237858289469948
not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to	 20.561054452845415
the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular	 30.44685607575286
notice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress;	 56.943585218734654
they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,	 17.34682522592675
apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being	 39.063166459914996
aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable	 70.57342467993212
partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from	 55.036174770402816
him was ecstacy.	 68.89223229480024
She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of	 29.044496933310654
Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances	 52.522718836733866
were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with	 31.780590437558182
her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took	 21.395526751903756
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without	 43.89719274015695
knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again	 38.96692934655342
immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of	 27.29545935124793
mind; Charlotte tried to console her.	 57.38720553789154
"I dare say you will find him very agreeable."	 15.06747451209475
"Heaven forbid!--_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--To	 27.789947838135625
find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--Do not wish me	 87.52594453964744
such an evil."	 48.19298541947946
When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her	 48.80660426332597
hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a	 31.07070724074899
simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant	 31.20851121167576
in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no	 26.752452783348794
answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which	 28.0559309124487
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and	 27.783583800790893
reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it.	 49.738842141264705
They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to	 31.032495992830565
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at	 40.35154646524332
first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would	 61.711755339943544
be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made	 51.89768073699069
some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent.	 23.304114682466757
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with	 19.864233556893165
"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy.--_I_ talked about	 53.55031954898851
the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of	 20.825950788268678
the room, or the number of couples."	 15.4822516825653
He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be	 31.335116873787822
said.	 737.87269013595
"Very well.--That reply will do for the present.--Perhaps by and bye I	 46.25905124016452
may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public	 47.26551782945204
ones.--But _now_ we may be silent."	 54.51143223226608
"Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?"	 48.72373466634256
"Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be	 66.36502147170586
entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of	 25.06161792635203
_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the	 24.94565873572139
trouble of saying as little as possible."	 34.01646033205874
"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you	 28.85499063370993
imagine that you are gratifying mine?"	 23.87646851366834
"Both," replied Elizabeth archly; "for I have always seen a great	 24.992318828320418
similarity in the turn of our minds.--We are each of an unsocial,	 26.59953393720843
taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say	 33.06209224904274
something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to	 43.26595720402001
posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."	 10.100790215162423
"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,"	 14.976366579913938
said he. "How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say.--_You_	 36.42706131097113
think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."	 61.278533026167146
"I must not decide on my own performance."	 19.52822283488235
He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down	 12.33997502247649
the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often	 40.79222106826839
walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist	 26.27196561745041
the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just	 52.162390743442664
been forming a new acquaintance."	 36.659927552165115
The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his	 30.043761973558272
features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself	 49.923000305643704
for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a	 25.54662661432625
constrained manner said,	 92.36354013665587
"Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his	 22.920161443096482
_making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,	 41.10901762358061
is less certain."	 148.75899421036738
"He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship," replied Elizabeth	 24.708877808849188
with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all	 25.747489719014272
his life."	 146.91194638365718
Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At	 16.236340423844997
that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass	 27.04141322920745
through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.	 34.11267502255632
Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his	 39.1125621589726
dancing and his partner.	 126.64529237159594
"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir. Such very	 17.702243351746443
superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the	 25.047821822466926
first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not	 27.474691601565084
disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,	 60.76931440020805
especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza, (glancing	 26.019086326123052
at her sister and Bingley,) shall take place. What congratulations will	 75.30119388359854
then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you,	 56.425450308779524
Sir.--You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching	 21.02828428527262
converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."	 30.954932171276234
The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir	 43.97620659835487
William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his	 34.327916961052374
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and	 43.56145765913969
Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,	 63.933517966323905
he turned to his partner, and said,	 54.986718302034745
"Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of."	 16.207759453410823
"I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have	 12.888918456452144
interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for	 49.77856543974846
themselves.--We have tried two or three subjects already without	 24.55368858747186
success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine."	 53.78955917502396
"What think you of books?" said he, smiling.	 64.9437225664645
"Books--Oh! no.--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same	 35.03286393004374
feelings."	 603.8040643000694
"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be	 38.60349565001563
no want of subject.--We may compare our different opinions."	 36.025561125666144
"No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of	 27.44114594263922
something else."	 76.56680026920095
"The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?" said he,	 44.270328493329075
with a look of doubt.	 42.22551201860281
"Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her	 77.56778476622225
thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared	 52.88501226559793
by her suddenly exclaiming, "I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,	 59.02778671451721
that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was	 51.82371790061798
unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being	 33.96631837760808
created_."	 8965.87542987636
"I am," said he, with a firm voice.	 25.47526909916136
"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"	 35.8701226764827
"I hope not."	 52.774136743910965
"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,	 29.639438283563145
to be secure of judging properly at first."	 54.68998979632412
"May I ask to what these questions tend?"	 72.08006125760093
"Merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she, endeavouring	 52.96010742721293
to shake off her gravity. "I am trying to make it out."	 20.541865763376375
"And what is your success?"	 39.693708275127705
She shook her head. "I do not get on at all. I hear such different	 37.73197923990158
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."	 35.15204934881989
"I can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that report may vary	 42.19783872123373
greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were	 33.62159704443021
not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to	 26.85186714580064
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."	 50.15505411937391
"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another	 26.428638874222795
opportunity."	 1869.2878224654853
"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied.	 45.11162691073864
She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in	 26.91907074616978
silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for	 36.14635920029435
in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her,	 42.6552473907152
which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against	 67.25553311281699
another.	 1075.302356544936
They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with	 22.482710979511456
an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her,	 40.42192531897509
"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George	 33.52009881696847
Wickham!--Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a	 36.348890744413964
thousand questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you,	 38.747440607058586
among his other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the	 53.91897840446634
late Mr. Darcy's steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend,	 44.406983531887995
not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr.	 50.04138275243941
Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he	 35.90233107438367
has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has	 16.937673466502844
treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the	 25.04535332585752
particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to	 22.743018385948805
blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that	 25.60534938070531
though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his	 34.196404395787894
invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had	 15.581519074932585
taken himself out of the way. His coming into the country at all, is a	 43.97098369742842
most insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.	 49.669727507416255
I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt;	 22.265335787332376
but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better."	 39.288371890727895
"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said	 44.60222058000807
Elizabeth angrily; "for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse	 32.20524374132618
than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can	 35.7785020248185
assure you, he informed me himself."	 72.68350046341978
"I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.	 11.22975487586571
"Excuse my interference.--It was kindly meant."	 142.84035849833626
"Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself.--"You are much mistaken if	 33.767862557651675
you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see	 31.471422355925267
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.	 30.407164405223522
Darcy." She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make	 24.000390918499097
inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of	 46.63654449927299
such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently	 25.357635978384373
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the	 21.26539798884486
evening.--Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment	 37.313482413685506
solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing	 28.273396281904553
else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for	 40.66358608816348
happiness.	 1004.284033796578
"I want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her	 34.80056170504344
sister's, "what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have	 38.74065851146231
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case	 31.035557737638722
you may be sure of my pardon."	 27.36535031619989
"No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing	 24.569251822444006
satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his	 20.309102146866362
history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have	 28.348373635875706
principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,	 39.19883842595062
the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that	 22.000008788184637
Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has	 29.688396581746844
received; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his	 19.863596653785198
sister's, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am	 22.6904544245219
afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's	 43.280376380879176
regard."	 2276.9904695029727
"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?"	 26.96545795376991
"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton."	 35.734134840084955
"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am	 24.05090524097373
perfectly satisfied. But what does he say of the living?"	 49.94800987149134
"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard	 42.76622296358052
them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to	 28.98441370492296
him _conditionally_ only."	 192.96097901624455
"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity," said Elizabeth warmly;	 20.035138405432896
"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.	 87.3112702760399
Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but	 34.76977591687117
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt	 32.56368925584694
the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of	 53.11682109580839
both gentlemen as I did before."	 282.11482156284984
She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on	 54.029161202674395
which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with	 25.986582720999923
delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of	 75.92952098519176
Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence	 31.91998786438117
in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew	 40.717059452461264
to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last	 41.30164366799932
partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them and	 69.61704048160897
told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to	 15.231328836609661
make a most important discovery.	 28.09051164940313
"I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now	 38.3671022820548
in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the	 21.083492697959464
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of	 25.52367302620704
this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother	 26.34538673759858
Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would	 46.61732167106152
have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de	 37.23126102683062
Bourgh in this assembly!--I am most thankful that the discovery is made	 73.34862727092903
in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,	 24.133646593990946
and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total	 35.53666067927386
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology."	 106.95995110985834
"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?"	 13.43269152122756
"Indeed I am. I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.	 18.198757617911703
I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_. It will be in my power to	 15.901325530438402
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night."	 43.47605787929586
Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him	 18.57532625012235
that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as	 35.29992298593901
an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it	 36.59406094669326
was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either	 38.30537512553087
side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in	 59.95800853431392
consequence, to begin the acquaintance.--Mr. Collins listened to her	 49.133473735894995
with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she	 34.978767080955045
ceased speaking, replied thus,	 774.1507853042243
"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your	 18.17770419407948
excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your	 28.424210176807183
understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference	 30.31684558309887
between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those	 33.72321398831666
which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider	 32.558420281789715
the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank	 30.18228419947041
in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the	 31.934921935002116
same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates	 19.33276362660073
of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look	 29.33106264360489
on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your	 39.16132688414434
advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though	 69.90544079372391
in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and	 49.36667245978957
habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like	 19.021349536045182
yourself." And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose	 29.044346090620742
reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at	 31.895102084973935
being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with	 107.94974962358262
a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if	 28.25650995065489
hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology,"	 27.803521661179275
"Hunsford," and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh."--It vexed her to see him	 47.99431765855844
expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained	 31.0165436665996
wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied	 57.541035882600795
with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not	 13.749383257389532
discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed	 33.06100930847623
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the	 22.43883593463809
end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.	 42.945304338006586
Collins then returned to Elizabeth.	 39.15349900796808
"I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my	 18.17217843473472
reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered	 52.872850792036914
me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,	 35.3335924807556
that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be	 20.035337789794852
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very	 33.23646052326316
handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him."	 54.288708373081164
As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned	 49.11198220016193
her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley, and the	 33.698352738773124
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,	 27.11553255911989
made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in	 55.01847920298015
that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection	 71.5255918340308
could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of	 37.5106713554256
endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts	 71.48574857574457
she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to	 49.07511410070318
venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to	 30.751262956664842
supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which	 33.51964387664128
placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find	 33.906112745171946
that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,	 57.871444893381934
openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be	 40.3952759808996
soon married to Mr. Bingley.--It was an animating subject, and Mrs.	 48.75962297078942
Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of	 27.780109046219692
the match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living	 47.797966080696
but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;	 32.68508981286896
and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of	 43.152516666244594
Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as	 37.66866103278534
she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger	 43.09916623891229
daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of	 90.31087464273931
other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be	 42.09523757225703
able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that	 33.324740602299954
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was	 23.179768369052876
necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on	 59.89995239040804
such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.	 41.0500590399969
Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She	 45.14478418503831
concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally	 39.787810168616176
fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no	 81.78241086369056
chance of it.	 44.83431062738181
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's	 11.151347776092862
words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible	 30.40738823689525
whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the	 20.641967909951493
chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her	 18.135498179822942
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.	 70.12780255855145
"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am	 18.311103166688547
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say	 38.11101959575539
nothing _he_ may not like to hear."	 59.926068844097856
"For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower.--What advantage can it be to you	 114.60622301340004
to offend Mr. Darcy?--You will never recommend yourself to his friend by	 30.14798046375837
so doing."	 174.44057334078403
Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother	 37.88265970623302
would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed	 31.91795199529803
and blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently	 19.842294858985724
glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what	 34.297797897400216
she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was	 23.158469661504515
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression	 53.57150105364311
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and	 38.245499450435815
steady gravity.	 176.20061072215313
At length however Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who	 20.055631853772358
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no	 19.315276258577317
likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.	 13.135642780752457
Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of	 28.705116785581705
tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she	 80.46077907404981
had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,	 57.402074690376466
preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent	 35.56002106266846
entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of	 14.116175117404673
complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an	 23.64711945238895
opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.	 27.631019937687697
Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she	 16.253059472546504
watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience	 52.88544593561735
which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving	 70.29918560019834
amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be	 40.30693378278011
prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute	 39.65362411883256
began another. Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display;	 21.640893836831548
her voice was weak, and her manner affected.--Elizabeth was in agonies.	 32.23812157551205
She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly	 25.860080369552442
talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making	 40.878664071506435
signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however	 26.60754801762642
impenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his	 19.42298762563482
interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,	 45.25805703143678
and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,	 49.94294825594557
"That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough.	 25.538611949203624
Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."	 54.57291102304704
Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and	 64.77164265542655
Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid	 30.621490881635058
her anxiety had done no good.--Others of the party were now applied to.	 18.82041744890829
"If I," said Mr. Collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I	 27.767992662892752
should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an	 26.75269989472079
air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly	 73.23559258181483
compatible with the profession of a clergyman.--I do not mean however to	 24.059536140812952
assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to	 25.87016123972714
music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The	 49.88479818484101
rector of a parish has much to do.--In the first place, he must make	 29.04940428067823
such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not	 29.564449866518
offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time	 28.288877906119737
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care	 38.1411616555034
and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making	 27.501802389580767
as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance	 28.763161901636987
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every	 25.028089412559996
body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot	 43.47950207219026
acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should	 25.257959191145122
omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected	 40.5653621304167
with the family." And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech,	 36.56609237574157
which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.--Many	 27.77773634448379
stared.--Many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet	 44.364183470321265
himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having	 35.598767668408314
spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that	 77.22206763294399
he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.	 23.680927534014877
To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to	 47.21524561175667
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would	 39.37427855205492
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or	 37.51793798207476
finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister	 74.19029428068825
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his	 27.503205945541193
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he	 29.5898194153396
must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should	 44.81832574150673
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and	 30.47280115275295
she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or	 27.010995913684024
the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.	 24.615269109136452
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teazed by	 18.625506612759292
Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he	 22.704331427153726
could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her	 25.734612043254536
power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with	 22.082116580427883
somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.	 21.370006149523235
He assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;	 32.05511437532623
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to	 28.69780287749925
her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her	 32.80526538847134
the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed	 33.36032933153315
her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and	 16.232968322276704
good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.	 97.24780734195507
She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy's farther notice;	 10.026209377533657
though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite	 23.558741927171383
disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the	 20.97692178151971
probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in	 21.7123317271723
it.	 110.84070322522837
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a	 34.413435970299915
manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of	 20.17995493775693
an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how	 28.11714579817077
heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her	 31.92392463487154
sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and	 41.79722150772729
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed	 48.55818937636999
every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a	 34.37519230807553
languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the	 11.923565120625518
long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his	 22.686498620561107
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and	 22.429285920062334
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said	 35.20981704895814
nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.	 60.47832703580827
Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the	 21.214655428085134
rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a	 52.31139822813066
silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too	 53.484485131627814
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord,	 37.87312889739712
how tired I am!" accompanied by a violent yawn.	 23.52976498217132
When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly	 23.929402788425207
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and	 39.304675463793
addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy	 41.388853018613766
he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,	 34.888176223792996
without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful	 30.861323993547465
pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of	 38.4284484276664
waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to	 40.546917875699336
go the next day for a short time.	 57.67881438721873
Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the	 21.023742761056738
delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of	 27.34692862761048
settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly	 38.53410229247421
see her daughter settled at Netherfield, in the course of three or four	 23.736709532436187
months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought	 43.44027936719903
with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.	 32.18936339692928
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the	 33.49119798720965
man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each	 66.82124560556491
was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.	 26.577774629379196
CHAPTER XIX.	 12.911953956184709
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his	 30.17732586385741
declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as	 35.12454399226566
his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having	 61.98334484756241
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the	 40.03679374783529
moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the	 36.15370638341425
observances which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding	 21.963735428016527
Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon	 41.727610405866855
after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,	 40.95481842866293
"May I hope, Madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,	 57.985058967460546
when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the	 25.94066378519648
course of this morning?"	 74.03555495390094
Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, Mrs.	 32.85634693727379
Bennet instantly answered,	 106.89178910716961
"Oh dear!--Yes--certainly.--I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am	 21.89219665654654
sure she can have no objection.--Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs." And	 52.5466458745163
gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth	 54.902769660706134
called out,	 82.90232639440518
"Dear Ma'am, do not go.--I beg you will not go.--Mr. Collins must excuse	 30.995979076436353
me.--He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear. I am	 21.44795543982817
going away myself."	 107.83532473622483
"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.--I desire you will stay where you are."--And	 35.27506418511983
upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about	 110.91167171817668
to escape, she added, "Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing	 60.89279722001218
Mr. Collins."	 18.726384204252756
Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's	 28.414158769293536
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it	 37.596090634803105
over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried	 34.32267325068675
to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided	 44.04560546038809
between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as	 34.4629319047888
soon as they were gone Mr. Collins began.	 27.40538019608002
"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from	 21.5449122314272
doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You	 59.747955833899915
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little	 51.06382647277992
unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected	 13.589479530217146
mother's permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport	 31.7602875418799
of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to	 27.027694113663678
dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as	 32.95787093215736
soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my	 37.688871069396285
future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this	 35.678305139179386
subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for	 30.430806879462175
marrying--and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of	 38.16214879171513
selecting a wife, as I certainly did."	 33.84601407893655
The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away	 30.6286129753614
with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not	 52.43774869323907
use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and	 47.27922650834188
he continued:	 93.27868662138269
"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for	 51.64559120856636
every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example	 129.44430077825018
of matrimony in his parish. Secondly, that I am convinced it will add	 27.696386874503986
very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have	 37.632703904371404
mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation	 48.80161920646618
of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.	 16.009072086417255
Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this	 77.8332983020801
subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left	 44.85280605845322
Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was	 31.667949584673384
arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'Mr. Collins, you	 39.22966769758624
must marry. A clergyman like you must marry.--Chuse properly, chuse a	 44.62345337827725
gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,	 35.53268458891694
useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small	 39.55234283097975
income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as	 50.21302813305131
you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the	 38.83406115806412
way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and	 25.269876212367816
kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the	 20.035019725886865
advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond any	 27.379137300632962
thing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be	 40.92839240124433
acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect	 68.30868055805391
which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general	 101.3267510009748
intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views	 68.44623151382612
were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I	 21.11662798863007
assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that	 37.17028789695532
being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured	 34.08779028768263
father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy	 37.56371550345927
myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that	 43.50241844643296
the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy	 53.158172662187894
event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be	 53.57512587572344
for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I	 26.342233289169226
flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing	 27.122456582810837
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the	 28.4937902066318
violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and	 23.115044983258755
shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well	 41.554342648562844
aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds	 25.05229042921076
in the 4 per cents. which will not be yours till after your mother's	 33.61599250887852
decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,	 23.274785029076146
therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that	 35.09746523997259
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married."	 48.17769306284442
It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.	 16.534518277414787
"You are too hasty, Sir," she cried. "You forget that I have made no	 36.28914105585409
answer. Let me do it without farther loss of time. Accept my thanks for	 32.55982259574922
the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of	 20.940611211701977
your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline	 14.935464460272833
them."	 292.3017873216418
"I am not now to learn," replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the	 27.98729354808467
hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the	 38.99271971859479
man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their	 70.11636727635624
favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a	 93.14325278550022
third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just	 44.348632634847796
said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long."	 53.71910969929634
"Upon my word, Sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is rather an	 63.02700321524885
extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not	 26.273745134752765
one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so	 47.86020369811296
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second	 28.805597523049276
time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal.--You could not make _me_	 25.29034207150251
happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who	 21.12919888599858
would make _you_ so.--Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I	 74.26942882333748
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the	 43.748567726761834
situation."	 2547.2571975390756
"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," said Mr. Collins	 40.204371253076964
very gravely--"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all	 24.846637974634746
disapprove of you. And you may be certain that when I have the honour of	 13.768097923618788
seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,	 24.976132157163246
economy, and other amiable qualifications."	 58.989550083467265
"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must	 34.41043791928265
give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of	 31.26721907519656
believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by	 50.45610037093321
refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.	 61.061572117691775
In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your	 40.017291113183006
feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn	 49.78018499193454
estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be	 45.04493230643965
considered, therefore, as finally settled." And rising as she thus	 82.26464347714386
spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus	 42.99779875787938
addressed her,	 160.83793760940156
"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I	 20.059793759892106
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given	 19.9802519956763
me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I	 27.504513020474562
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the	 24.34146778659188
first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to	 44.3538717029176
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the	 17.80088066074499
female character."	 234.9023973739822
"Really, Mr. Collins," cried Elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me	 54.57270660453912
exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form	 76.44357415277926
of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as	 23.876224774610016
may convince you of its being one."	 49.142097478435005
"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your	 17.237630554747266
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for	 54.424905011412335
believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand	 36.93314599610835
is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would	 54.06229547135406
be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections	 23.944090918766616
with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are	 29.139750326405366
circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther	 57.10409618253698
consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no	 26.75927584942446
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your	 49.555471888114816
portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the	 36.85930433711224
effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must	 25.857332110657353
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I	 20.660872809058922
shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by	 46.550288212525906
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females."	 16.869009680316186
"I do assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension whatever to that kind	 29.065138492208376
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would	 35.59546087678294
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you	 32.49058144316861
again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but	 48.54781359545782
to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect	 56.511606142643636
forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant	 44.01731593754968
female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the	 27.022308558799683
truth from her heart."	 68.59263089184931
"You are uniformly charming!" cried he, with an air of awkward	 39.96729234345541
gallantry; "and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express	 36.83852931599292
authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of	 54.16539592801743
being acceptable."	 105.5604120531185
To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no	 43.085280112388524
reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he	 81.44763249278013
persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering	 42.603658044333805
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered	 20.64444810999592
in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could	 24.53679192162372
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.	 18.5058752053963
CHAPTER XX.	 12.911953956184709
Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his	 24.547146380076466
successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule	 37.4464579055588
to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the	 20.380415813828286
door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she	 43.09754421252456
entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in	 26.344209009787736
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins	 43.314323155118245
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then	 43.8891677004506
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result	 24.850746203899046
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the	 24.782372506948697
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow	 60.176181640822506
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.	 38.05634476787128
This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet;--she would have been	 40.58118374463386
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage	 25.99503629495807
him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe	 33.278613781678786
it, and could not help saying so.	 21.556743064467344
"But depend upon it, Mr. Collins," she added, "that Lizzy shall be	 25.744212745192165
brought to reason. I will speak to her about it myself directly. She is	 62.2349248034209
a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but	 20.084607860619176
I will _make_ her know it."	 58.499965119601505
"Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam," cried Mr. Collins; "but if she	 42.5965062478197
is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would	 45.598889436701704
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who	 31.483234212041538
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she	 68.90483237302607
actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to	 50.69086413229539
force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of	 71.22029102193122
temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity."	 38.591249578533514
"Sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. "Lizzy is	 37.75234238905098
only headstrong in such matters as these. In every thing else she is as	 34.575933411098056
good natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and	 33.61850688575074
we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure."	 29.834325705587176
She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her	 29.2632982024318
husband, called out as she entered the library,	 46.79493900802554
"Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.	 31.829469867904805
You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will	 67.27969085762021
not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and	 34.68147867507228
not have _her_."	 145.93278029362497
Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them	 41.175449375400966
on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by	 13.009818923786021
her communication.	 147.04071282127495
"I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had	 19.358167614682692
finished her speech. "Of what are you talking?"	 66.77831168444507
"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,	 43.80057952604558
and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy."	 26.484324404726305
"And what am I to do on the occasion?--It seems an hopeless business."	 69.55301996745958
"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her	 45.06868478461075
marrying him."	 194.09689561148073
"Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion."	 41.25970384914896
Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the	 20.9630872797944
library.	 4505.944044823731
"Come here, child," cried her father as she appeared. "I have sent for	 50.61890177111549
you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made	 53.69843999350411
you an offer of marriage. Is it true?" Elizabeth replied that it was.	 27.359350364342447
"Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?"	 31.35126449042181
"I have, Sir."	 41.15183335445898
"Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your	 66.82113692505027
accepting it. Is not it so, Mrs. Bennet?"	 30.761380424307553
"Yes, or I will never see her again."	 32.205056688142186
"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must	 110.90782175755834
be a stranger to one of your parents.--Your mother will never see you	 29.157894274761606
again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again	 18.686672584367848
if you _do_."	 26.961404739632066
Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;	 23.19104366236881
but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the	 41.57455786758909
affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.	 63.14309053425632
"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way? You promised me	 17.866960229482878
to _insist_ upon her marrying him."	 21.14121999311115
"My dear," replied her husband, "I have two small favours to request.	 40.043215785250666
First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the	 26.949394361971756
present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the	 21.93573467861955
library to myself as soon as may be."	 33.67295885537105
Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did	 33.89682742507773
Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;	 40.78526610119648
coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in	 22.444906155344764
her interest, but Jane with all possible mildness declined	 78.40405597160063
interfering;--and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and	 37.48401164406552
sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks. Though her manner	 55.499384311781625
varied however, her determination never did.	 48.83125113076956
Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.	 17.878167104197356
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin	 47.47924375837043
could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other	 51.749738101984704
way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her	 30.334110897518467
deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.	 49.49485298066748
While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend	 36.43232340154241
the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to	 40.66815877974373
her, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are come, for there is such	 36.47005324842191
fun here!--What do you think has happened this morning?--Mr. Collins has	 71.91831301578982
made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him."	 40.37911343343521
Charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,	 26.099359464178576
who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the	 27.10734113321518
breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on	 39.36490836305949
the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating	 25.472799368363326
her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her	 28.08858533594525
family. "Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas," she added in a melancholy tone,	 26.516277417504103
"for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used,	 41.9170563059617
nobody feels for my poor nerves."	 56.99772034413038
Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.	 25.633207122610372
"Aye, there she comes," continued Mrs. Bennet, "looking as unconcerned	 52.46814354154363
as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided	 43.229879052296695
she can have her own way.--But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take	 47.59354757633163
it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,	 43.93319877379176
you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is	 14.208759809798742
to maintain you when your father is dead.--_I_ shall not be able to keep	 18.73398325741886
you--and so I warn you.--I have done with you from this very day.--I	 58.10962723800595
told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you	 27.68476420055241
again, and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in	 25.14817655679537
talking to undutiful children.--Not that I have much pleasure indeed in	 40.989846403261204
talking to any body. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints	 38.801962715272396
can have no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I	 37.369305986544305
suffer!--But it is always so. Those who do not complain are never	 36.44157227004165
pitied."	 8.776652323334677
Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any	 52.538805210385306
attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation.	 65.66272276546414
She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till	 57.62848715871807
they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more stately	 24.28823126904309
than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,	 64.4603103731465
"Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and	 20.935674107729593
let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together."	 49.95308989759747
Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but	 43.4408379477654
Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,	 75.87774021969395
detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after	 28.462721449064865
herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little	 38.99139041289372
curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending	 33.92154120548509
not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected	 13.038960826227544
conversation.--"Oh! Mr. Collins!"--	 16.8988774248376
"My dear Madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point.	 21.31348780904683
Far be it from me," he presently continued in a voice that marked his	 69.83713219858622
displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to	 44.26277958243099
inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man	 24.9647081760011
who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I	 15.3480731790164
trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my	 53.51694545877387
positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I	 31.76089686177738
have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the	 41.68614994341133
blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.	 23.638890887017013
You will not, I hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your	 30.926228665404178
family, my dear Madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your	 31.442388715441222
daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the	 49.2677536948014
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.	 32.59889008339464
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission	 43.74028389218881
from your daughter's lips instead of your own. But we are all liable to	 19.47775246376589
error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair. My object	 51.473514779634975
has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due	 51.84810274835559
consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_	 73.7163911391875
has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise."	 18.857200014423814
CHAPTER XXI.	 12.911953956184709
The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and	 17.21300385891841
Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily	 58.44176195000093
attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.	 49.98390691706958
As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not	 47.62925508477998
by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by	 47.46240912743591
stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to	 24.333131615316216
her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of	 18.59069403856776
himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose	 29.200041039795828
civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and	 36.3493527022174
especially to her friend.	 59.144397535568125
The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill humour or ill	 43.075421790334964
health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth	 49.936964492399476
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did	 25.329956981327584
not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on	 36.04725452645185
Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.	 125.76171808830239
After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham	 39.43805148257945
were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.	 38.02053683418271
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their	 29.92836938732118
aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was	 31.5079662228245
well talked over.--To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged	 134.21939550475062
that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed.	 18.17060515781128
"I found," said he, "as the time drew near, that I had better not meet	 30.520559937026306
Mr. Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so	 40.01289257088703
many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes	 38.127045261291116
might arise unpleasant to more than myself."	 28.91691854013278
She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full	 35.291792017163544
discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly	 40.45173640495346
bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with	 58.03935528358537
them to Longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her.	 37.348111331833486
His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the	 32.12351467571389
compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an	 40.13953056056096
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.	 43.48354412894548
Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came	 37.82775479187236
from Netherfield, and was opened immediately. The envelope contained a	 51.75784689783752
sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's	 40.299120546258294
fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as	 44.579865300853754
she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.	 43.27409293219651
Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to	 38.1184277266582
join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but	 48.62827952908128
Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention	 42.50378939321971
even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,	 69.76025711795812
than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs. When they	 42.58658722624738
had gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,	 106.04624421396838
"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a	 63.37681339182159
good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are	 37.90527330728635
on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.	 24.424636693367145
You shall hear what she says."	 25.450208464566902
She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information	 20.800743224474676
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,	 30.143581908602773
and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr.	 70.29145741669369
Hurst had a house. The next was in these words. "I do not pretend to	 46.08098344143495
regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my	 59.21855234761179
dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many	 113.09712887896245
returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean	 26.857682527617992
while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most	 57.52392806612017
unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that." To these high	 79.96845468856041
flown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of	 20.76459251377368
distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she	 23.232935743774924
saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their	 27.305048996326263
absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as	 75.91156897698463
to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon	 26.521994095216105
cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.	 29.483662323404225
"It is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be	 14.70871300166277
able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not	 83.16103146094576
hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks	 32.8563720274417
forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful	 81.21307719254801
intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater	 83.31590100184529
satisfaction as sisters?--Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by	 39.3106093969867
them."	 292.3017873216418
"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into	 63.497522911803635
Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you--	 46.43828967581149
"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which	 39.18958448816811
took him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we	 34.8492421491308
are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when	 28.743668114522343
Charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have	 37.282530130381495
determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend	 35.03569090620299
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance are	 45.29288476691817
already there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest	 52.464566556469414
friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I	 31.58515105133139
despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in	 32.39616113188035
the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux	 42.84226460175264
will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of	 26.843112902359277
whom we shall deprive you."	 55.179420955942845
"It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more this	 40.47730129172208
winter."	 11507.549288798064
"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_."	 19.464436347706965
"Why will you think so? It must be his own doing.--He is his own master.	 36.41324813291048
But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which	 27.95208298849585
particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_." "Mr. Darcy	 29.640177076568982
is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are	 33.24953703378738
scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana	 37.789702289990124
Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the	 48.26882079235034
affection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into	 173.27974774725007
something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of	 63.24533439191361
her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before	 37.392652999951295
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the	 20.463748504351898
country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them	 30.764931936559545
unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already, he will have	 52.87880209381114
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her	 46.43999989752496
relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's	 122.79310281614497
partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most	 42.80666355629558
capable of engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances to	 62.004508013891524
favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest	 70.2695408615111
Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness	 31.512149729203614
of so many?"	 80.27895575553234
"What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?"--said Jane as she	 60.57912304141529
finished it. "Is it not clear enough?--Does it not expressly declare	 65.364337410213
that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she	 66.51617109877328
is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she	 20.73259110564509
suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to	 48.87350757631558
put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?"	 40.70636947577697
"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.--Will you hear it?"	 56.330888039703986
"Most willingly."	 66.52625594793118
"You shall have it in few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is	 40.00830403575461
in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to	 20.533903344620754
town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he	 33.6385978534236
does not care about you."	 21.753142554970054
Jane shook her head.	 18.252358395246038
"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.--No one who has ever seen you	 66.13336376975504
together, can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley I am sure cannot. She is	 78.35567216901056
not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy	 33.04926094576619
for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is	 37.38379676151909
this. We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the	 23.509298766016155
more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that	 42.43022174833944
when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in	 55.9770032336078
achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I	 38.93506741765419
dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,	 32.84691554515805
my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley	 46.76018932228945
tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest	 54.840891151157486
degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on	 34.55939222816272
Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of	 23.128446638526167
being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend."	 22.753059381990898
"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your	 74.75770072277301
representation of all this, might make me quite easy. But I know the	 32.08921591870256
foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any	 29.26420003070595
one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived	 40.22287860331705
herself."	 374.1154146567428
"That is right.--You could not have started a more happy idea, since you	 20.370654340211246
will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived by all means.	 38.9987384643614
You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer."	 47.26383222108975
"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in	 58.545741026121014
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry	 30.594436241093412
elsewhere?"	 8.776652323334677
"You must decide for yourself," said Elizabeth, "and if upon mature	 48.45816810410577
deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is	 30.80381685657794
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by	 34.75525406790312
all means to refuse him."	 35.22194545902339
"How can you talk so?"--said Jane faintly smiling,--"You must know that	 45.76309183253376
though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could	 29.80801773968898
not hesitate."	 38.10055011462249
"I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider	 39.29112829973516
your situation with much compassion."	 120.94782451068859
"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be	 23.623580221118917
required. A thousand things may arise in six months!"	 51.465353899293696
The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost	 25.54489701993193
contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's	 42.19750750232573
interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those	 49.96448353714312
wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man	 64.66390174757716
so totally independent of every one.	 42.51192143526476
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on	 23.17986842810037
the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.	 41.84918102987605
Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,	 49.48535935799696
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that	 43.258192942805955
Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.	 88.87362072825314
They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the	 25.22818602387385
family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;	 18.243893273312313
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,	 29.862353105007266
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen	 41.33618904136081
to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together. After	 27.154533735985783
lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking	 45.674239193263915
that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn,	 24.648094220391215
and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though	 48.51113490625789
he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have	 24.16340292087136
two full courses.	 95.37577739474538
CHAPTER XXII.	 12.911953956184709
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again during the	 30.98106587695493
chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.	 32.57890316135236
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. "It keeps him in good	 39.43668470411939
humour," said she, "and I am more obliged to you than I can express."	 48.94535574126462
Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and	 42.20067586082269
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was	 28.5647243270426
very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth	 129.4646205371201
had any conception of;--its object was nothing less, than to secure her	 29.83094329289711
from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards	 41.95929358404248
herself. Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so	 156.37930629862544
favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost	 25.398324432637757
sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.	 46.82721864530685
But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his	 23.197335914212978
character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next	 35.874963024837896
morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw	 24.44152597536067
himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,	 25.01195675235836
from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to	 27.398008046335217
conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known	 30.29652784798085
till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost	 104.77208622752433
secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,	 54.67913552345222
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His	 18.378928773654522
reception however was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas perceived	 54.07419295671032
him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly	 27.123442164864333
set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had she dared	 43.13027250116161
to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.	 28.65466688075067
In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow, every	 66.3744338084187
thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they	 32.646708193451055
entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was	 37.58817753899512
to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be	 19.299055050602487
waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his	 59.515030780499174
happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must	 30.0754461584104
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its	 44.702107300171605
continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and	 16.302731108142797
disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that	 26.791119843441045
establishment were gained.	 385.80319953262835
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;	 28.844762654389047
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins's present	 30.7158074219895
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom	 22.841593746777075
they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were	 39.017175822060686
exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more	 60.508654421563755
interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer	 37.01618586574018
Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided	 36.76738729551745
opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the	 35.20776935486961
Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife	 34.506540415007855
should make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family in short	 30.81023529931729
were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes	 22.894892122081643
of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have	 24.01266921289392
done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's	 32.28113282509415
dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had	 49.61181554400448
gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were	 85.1584121927772
in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor	 35.102174465833535
agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be	 36.324076901266835
imaginary. But still he would be her husband.--Without thinking highly	 103.93432054330881
either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it	 87.47876950249638
was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small	 49.08435148804572
fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their	 78.04766082408818
pleasantest preservative from want. This preservative she had now	 50.769942061422874
obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been	 27.340677111228146
handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable	 37.62635287453783
circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to	 59.04783042617184
Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other	 54.51260290282692
person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though	 79.2173999402586
her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such	 17.784258282652203
disapprobation. She resolved to give her the information herself, and	 40.84861507755621
therefore charged Mr. Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner,	 48.32909540644976
to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family. A promise	 28.536805560960673
of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept	 30.009264209261982
without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst	 41.804270732901315
forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some	 28.75375525510058
ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great	 17.721009678022998
self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.	 25.181253196449536
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the	 26.87991220670517
family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved	 26.11936132241806
for the night; and Mrs. Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said	 25.69793588269382
how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his	 29.96254311593387
other engagements might allow him to visit them.	 26.762594734749793
"My dear Madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly	 24.27083267150684
gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you	 30.877828329280934
may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as	 18.199559490991042
possible."	 1439.6424216076052
They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for	 15.29451779098279
so speedy a return, immediately said,	 104.67207306640492
"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my	 30.487376692214806
good sir?--You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of	 36.68163085499283
offending your patroness."	 63.54164459633825
"My dear sir," replied Mr. Collins, "I am particularly obliged to you	 16.46221072286555
for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so	 23.77434886953658
material a step without her ladyship's concurrence."	 75.04438633755066
"You cannot be too much on your guard. Risk any thing rather than her	 12.823154286636578
displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us	 29.29241501107264
again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,	 37.69231881716009
and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence."	 57.00110915529716
"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such	 26.864232258104202
affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive	 42.877224586208605
from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of	 31.16927621360259
your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins,	 32.82765723273273
though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall	 25.26497630409066
now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting	 44.43032952212756
my cousin Elizabeth."	 209.1570002678304
With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally	 50.32318299958001
surprised to find that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished	 48.1059996141938
to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of	 37.283927767420494
her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.	 23.548195613971323
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a	 32.48241958353399
solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no	 26.6683815911545
means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and	 67.81194111836756
improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very	 32.91755116765668
agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this	 39.69477592592807
kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a	 44.91283594842187
private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.	 26.535056114048214
The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her	 21.782840937506766
friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but	 24.642535278875673
that Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from	 39.70960932675813
possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her	 42.706730278521185
astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the	 45.667039895476485
bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,	 11.786240085696344
"Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte,--impossible!"	 66.65181515351789
The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her	 26.649496985278525
story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a	 40.86216887002123
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon	 45.568154478883145
regained her composure, and calmly replied,	 51.41178658020541
"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?--Do you think it incredible	 31.383925606403423
that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,	 22.637453374873004
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"	 22.41273844990881
But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort	 28.561709403403253
for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect	 42.45125463532716
of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished	 23.43872202781909
her all imaginable happiness.	 170.18843505689102
"I see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte,--"you must be	 43.518853723665224
surprised, very much surprised,--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to	 56.62498380612002
marry you. But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you	 36.090612661345396
will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic you know. I	 21.04968569395313
never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's	 69.47958521223647
character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my	 32.856980312667716
chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on	 55.10609200290604
entering the marriage state."	 64.48096240351822
Elizabeth quietly answered "Undoubtedly;"--and after an awkward pause,	 33.37913210902039
they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much	 18.88330307165422
longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It	 27.888034772538084
was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so	 28.894315728102583
unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers	 28.25533839860559
of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being	 34.823018983614055
now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony	 36.91426388020768
was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it	 14.55697243014609
possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every	 70.869234923066
better feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins,	 57.71688688535053
was a most humiliating picture!--And to the pang of a friend disgracing	 16.68636630353456
herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction	 33.03713096883835
that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot	 21.166824655018733
she had chosen.	 32.074430812650974
CHAPTER XXIII.	 12.911953956184709
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what	 28.338739281374973
she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it,	 35.144695862417464
when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to	 44.17149019580987
announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,	 24.139494642578097
and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the	 22.76474807426624
houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,	 32.616617265567065
but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than	 27.13861240398382
politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and Lydia, always	 44.45518606777053
unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,	 35.571867926371496
"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story?--Do not you know	 27.973978764879316
that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?"	 35.43197122213596
Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne	 11.224757375993859
without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried	 43.429955334551266
him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the	 32.72433647670504
truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the	 36.86401504642193
most forbearing courtesy.	 26.70388821487571
Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant	 45.11264741756568
a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by	 50.335983359250505
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and	 50.999386214124996
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,	 20.8339684647981
by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she	 14.779819584612577
was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the	 23.868389555145573
happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character	 42.84102014824376
of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.	 33.58156668081714
Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while	 17.189975344401763
Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings	 29.828427111057934
found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving	 26.280145349138177
the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins	 20.715319527724134
had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy	 24.7509108589374
together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two	 35.314573675677515
inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that	 58.50818082950194
Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that	 17.776429995813633
she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two	 73.95359426540381
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could	 20.46476862458842
console and nothing appease her.--Nor did that day wear out her	 164.75416951962276
resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without	 96.88892476739993
scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William	 23.301856882008217
or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she	 51.30938600911329
could at all forgive their daughter.	 58.92076584605095
Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such	 27.308912635162994
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for	 26.18112275031067
it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had	 23.327928000387082
been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and	 32.96886870228775
more foolish than his daughter!	 35.54345255790932
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said	 65.95060224679871
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;	 81.50031887286914
nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and	 49.29766144620773
Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a	 32.683464010668324
clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news	 32.64795349326911
to spread at Meryton.	 43.38453104836667
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on	 21.323759759538962
Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she	 38.42538306184213
called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,	 27.367854019091336
though Mrs. Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been	 25.962723126688566
enough to drive happiness away.	 57.134113271212094
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them	 31.710824943597586
mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no	 16.85660668205671
real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her	 73.47951840110457
disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her	 67.80670649471521
sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could	 105.06230672450762
never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as	 73.35615824480504
Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.	 42.474949541092926
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting	 23.160204292480618
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised	 60.93851510423915
letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their	 46.965076283679586
father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a	 43.353722434908285
twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging	 34.44656053366987
his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many	 20.92250081606629
rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection	 38.84073037948469
of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was	 14.823871692321934
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready	 28.436736771989153
to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither	 41.42970888756827
he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,	 20.305687202006357
he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take	 40.05654419419967
place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable	 17.046838387346288
argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him	 73.75085078448092
the happiest of men.	 15.865039502241713
Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of	 17.22209762404653
pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary she was as much disposed to	 17.63153508975243
complain of it as her husband.--It was very strange that he should come	 23.23653927982393
to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient	 20.239177319061582
and exceedingly troublesome.--She hated having visitors in the house	 58.52909151662775
while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the	 67.17349829318054
most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they	 56.45280152725797
gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continued	 41.470746421678676
absence.	 3779.3937401499625
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after	 83.54426124010313
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the	 34.82037643415864
report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to	 56.28378628660471
Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.	 46.48062943464216
Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous	 36.74051816307551
falsehood.	 8.776652323334677
Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that	 46.45375427026409
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she	 35.23734338789911
was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so	 39.49395289892893
dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its	 11.539914085796285
frequently recurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters	 55.37256362765078
and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss	 42.59102242639996
Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for	 33.311260357976586
the strength of his attachment.	 13.45639815371866
As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more	 60.609736775164436
painful than Elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of	 54.399354818913054
concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject	 59.17575236764638
was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an	 80.33850994199989
hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her	 16.349139113289027
impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he	 55.75350134259676
did not come back, she should think herself very ill used. It needed all	 32.948632286729904
Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable	 78.63951796464552
tranquillity.	 2349.196044979379
Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his	 17.31565614962975
reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his	 32.09862385537992
first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;	 64.98316391871094
and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them	 35.941617625430474
from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by	 19.10504236440305
him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time	 90.20906981251854
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.	 28.63948655756078
Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of any	 21.164632717848143
thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and	 30.28829238307207
wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of	 46.17628512232017
Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she	 37.48734231811955
regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see	 24.18219820614655
them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and	 43.871729898229084
whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that	 16.601699084798035
they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself	 21.7234461237496
and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She	 21.422006403550267
complained bitterly of all this to her husband.	 25.12311974680976
"Indeed, Mr. Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that Charlotte	 16.587905974620522
Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to	 27.57469807348929
make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!"	 47.560838814038895
"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for	 18.23833120276299
better things. Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor."	 16.92453625547963
This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and, therefore, instead of	 19.6154030798137
making any answer, she went on as before,	 81.84104720147
"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was	 16.791923585142804
not for the entail I should not mind it."	 30.734724900811553

Collins too!--Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?"	 62.17335075703383
"I leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr. Bennet.	 44.14528957930257

CHAPTER I.	 254.0372352719546
Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first	 29.034893861971128
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for	 47.85593239186921
the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had	 50.909628367532136
time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left	 28.864926383256673
the country.	 52.207351272420375
Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of	 42.029301740901055
the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the	 25.554938176726562
writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy's praise occupied	 69.92311775718974
the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline	 53.247830899930726
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict	 10.382674045505018
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former	 15.835698622461386
letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an	 26.90537148322334
inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of	 16.43192032158012
the latter with regard to new furniture.	 75.78618257004436
Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,	 47.7161204523123
heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern	 44.64436087559872
for her sister, and resentment against all the others. To Caroline's	 30.412316137092933
assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no	 13.379137778838263
credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she	 21.201145889945366
had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she	 31.889490203311848
could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness	 52.27009920071123
of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave	 31.613589066541458
of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to	 34.67203778052895
the caprice of their inclinations. Had his own happiness, however, been	 22.680707368512966
the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what	 26.157192317111058
ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she	 67.88713613567154
thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on	 42.27476344840029
which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She	 34.103278700996775
could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley's regard had really	 52.19084453671285
died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he	 29.856671027354565
had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his	 23.463779539736127
observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be	 52.710210249722685
materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained	 41.42063715403635
the same, her peace equally wounded.	 101.07969129631483
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to	 21.599901215568295
Elizabeth; but at last on Mrs. Bennet's leaving them together, after a	 37.834854475504095
longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could	 53.43796684289008
not help saying,	 41.003022727975086
"Oh! that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no	 57.082956828640825
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I	 45.01784692687915
will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall	 42.46245104156304
all be as we were before."	 130.35689149685595
Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said	 33.43039299080935
nothing.	 421.23545976312556
"You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you have no	 41.388011777335194
reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my	 31.503110224335096
acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear,	 60.77898750434227
and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not _that_ pain. A	 50.192906410759775
little time therefore.--I shall certainly try to get the better."	 88.75582337240844
With a stronger voice she soon added, "I have this comfort immediately,	 41.853528178728546
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it	 20.82902078806314
has done no harm to any one but myself."	 43.781045628997454
"My dear Jane!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "you are too good. Your sweetness	 26.093973025161873
and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to	 19.005183334618263
you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you	 41.83851582133034
deserve."	 7215.009090329725
Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back	 37.81482572103916
the praise on her sister's warm affection.	 47.71527396844967
"Nay," said Elizabeth, "this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the	 53.347705397171225
world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of any body. _I_ only	 42.38004913891494
want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be	 45.264388588559385
afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your	 34.874900300250445
privilege of universal good will. You need not. There are few people	 20.54968076221959
whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see	 79.00967601801177
of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms	 91.79743815202146
my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the	 19.02069381029683
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit	 38.10496998563096
or sense. I have met with two instances lately; one I will not mention;	 59.4840050214529
the other is Charlotte's marriage. It is unaccountable! in every view it	 30.854553759051022
is unaccountable!"	 76.02745322177897
"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will	 17.986678549674483
ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of	 34.00309694441255
situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins's respectability, and	 66.01796302389995
Charlotte's prudent, steady character. Remember that she is one of a	 39.637066728321685
large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be	 42.343786990004254
ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something	 62.92693612144961
like regard and esteem for our cousin."	 81.2559798207355
"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else	 28.96390727748593
could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that	 31.20215386551552
Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her	 37.07741011264144
understanding, than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is	 58.61871829569589
a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well	 47.68679156158383
as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries	 36.18897585389149
him, cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her,	 45.02180017524821
though it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one	 31.663033384707056
individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor	 35.143385023596096
endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and	 41.944305372325765
insensibility of danger, security for happiness."	 124.05089483610564
"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied	 43.536828377953626
Jane, "and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy	 34.8700288698479
together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You	 92.63628648300849
mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I intreat	 50.776416631298446
you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and	 41.32037369041579
saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy	 29.969453457958107
ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man	 31.833509044931404
to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but	 22.255133857035517
our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than	 135.51306784342893
it does."	 124.4987597509137
"And men take care that they should."	 37.04212614075165
"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea	 25.722863557785
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine."	 49.64866004572878
"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's conduct to design,"	 25.326882720003812
said Elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others	 39.82835162627572
unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,	 31.411554090365964
want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution,	 48.43325620216684
will do the business."	 122.49523581737803
"And do you impute it to either of those?"	 51.43856326317767
"Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what	 40.65214323299227
I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can."	 43.570129289851415
"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him."	 51.59118519982497
"Yes, in conjunction with his friend."	 53.61927349245637
"I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can	 51.94746923523017
only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can	 36.920136387257735
secure it."	 148.75340222194632
"Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his	 60.93882682376402
happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they	 63.80451932878983
may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great	 39.1505244307582
connections, and pride."	 308.8264719955019
"Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse Miss Darcy," replied Jane;	 45.874787997528
"but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have	 46.564474311550555
known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love	 68.4193380206359
her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely	 28.897456316994763
they should have opposed their brother's. What sister would think	 51.48807885475448
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very	 41.34201084956445
objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try	 44.93201515863235
to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an	 52.11881455551539
affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most	 99.13305410983341
unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been	 19.0592867821639
mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of	 24.763729935641113
what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it	 44.76911720409645
in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood."	 35.59740728158285
Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley's	 23.120450498929895
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.	 53.270731747138996
Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no	 26.998149405811773
more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account	 33.02252170883031
for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it	 56.24012204225559
with less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what	 32.559314021550705
she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely	 32.30867526187439
the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw	 23.690299382759076
her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at	 37.82811235121538
the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet's best	 26.065054189966425
comfort was, that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.	 32.13059106307902
Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. "So, Lizzy," said he one day,	 36.80664517783592
"your sister is crossed in love I find. I congratulate her. Next to	 47.08515694874872
being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.	 20.709555283223104
It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among	 37.658534326194754
her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to be	 27.865487102634546
long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough at	 108.3238222193771
Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham	 25.861008779764173
be _your_ man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably."	 45.50659212862364
"Thank you, Sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not	 24.882294803316196
all expect Jane's good fortune."	 61.75434440961569
"True," said Mr. Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of	 20.49158949267624
that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always	 29.49481428873615
make the most of it."	 112.96989526763946
Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom,	 38.49598767849466
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn	 47.84512147540336
family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now	 47.14730204323087
added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already	 57.2171705208333
heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,	 35.50858448022799
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was	 17.48610702963431
pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they	 49.10199497168485
had known any thing of the matter.	 22.66002199380084
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any	 24.8615025411942
extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of	 21.594518880185902
Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for	 64.89572188527497
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else	 27.72748829835056
Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.	 25.194792425394965
CHAPTER II.	 12.911953956184709
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr.	 33.51755192981272
Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of	 65.75916188715478
Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his	 29.78870091894491
side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason	 31.798957806028078
to hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day	 54.7192211925363
would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave	 32.870886937803895
of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished	 48.74522035593127
his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father	 26.948501949387808
another letter of thanks.	 111.00976176462564
On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her	 25.183526752144502
brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at	 38.76089371882949
Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man, greatly	 36.236479863222975
superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield	 53.69807909706104
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by	 18.647803286994684
trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well	 14.176579952294285
bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than	 28.521124628838674
Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant	 36.286639971976676
woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the	 38.55967690776638
two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular	 62.06594894469121
regard. They had frequently been staying with her in town.	 39.88344743056045
The first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival, was to	 20.024832245455894
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was	 29.422057932293423
done, she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.	 42.97142924766534
Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They	 59.894828244738605
had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her	 53.03242128558267
girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing	 36.849782199643684
in it.	 92.71026957922234
"I do not blame Jane," she continued, "for Jane would have got Mr.	 34.15206497829444
Bingley, if she could. But, Lizzy! Oh, sister! it is very hard to think	 31.508214801507673
that she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by this time, had not it	 25.555731701240898
been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,	 50.06197011367896
and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have	 36.30164610409754
a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as	 25.04119355856822
much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed,	 36.403384322994334
sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of	 43.996450780080416
them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted	 18.952930091975876
so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves	 57.015786373603085
before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the	 60.01418281744673
greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of	 19.913159937534495
long sleeves."	 60.9926781932734
Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in	 29.44687856793006
the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her	 43.368244311334
sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the	 83.20629796749547
conversation.	 760.6645577472327
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. "It	 54.19237339557232
seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane," said she. "I am	 24.939611261549317
sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such	 66.59158997782812
as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl	 31.533942805766266
for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets	 21.914900893481285
her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent."	 33.12200712025419
"An excellent consolation in its way," said Elizabeth, "but it will not	 32.89074875840194
do for _us_. We do not suffer by _accident_. It does not often happen	 20.15293685431891
that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of	 26.27790564344396
independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in	 23.684127585075682
love with only a few days before."	 35.425458237452
"But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so	 49.804057478929565
doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as	 22.288007993154338
often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance,	 38.252984295937395
as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingley's	 46.189887221693134
love?"	 1808.7012440758792
"I never saw a more promising inclination. He was growing quite	 35.31662010888095
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time	 38.076894003784986
they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he	 36.75629908334979
offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and I	 25.86955833315229
spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be	 40.68528443130009
finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?"	 37.1839804404102
"Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor	 43.50007264374303
Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get	 45.22455289548079
over it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you	 61.76813177360051
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she	 44.33767186384991
would be prevailed on to go back with us? Change of scene might be of	 25.68506020689805
service--and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as	 60.78256333100694
anything."	 8.776652323334677
Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded	 30.311955208970712
of her sister's ready acquiescence.	 28.545456167197052
"I hope," added Mrs. Gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to	 32.899715308478406
this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of	 31.743012968596684
town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go	 79.89830280874659
out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,	 26.001058486785578
unless he really comes to see her."	 22.246319250536562
"And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his	 23.204789853289853
friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a	 30.43034647606391
part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may	 40.04694198174256
perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would	 43.67385123155926
hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its	 94.95929995209507
impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley	 36.092205627567466
never stirs without him."	 246.42188841896368
"So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane	 44.376365550899564
correspond with the sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling."	 28.88921623887565
"She will drop the acquaintance entirely."	 41.19852356444572
But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this	 49.852408180478406
point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being	 45.312462517325976
withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which	 42.535864803102825
convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely	 25.918325441461096
hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that	 42.4821425350142
his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends	 25.237787711990244
successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's	 19.190496143527085
attractions.	 9107.640786451831
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the	 21.77680826660248
Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she	 39.48912351670127
hoped that, by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother,	 38.568886225583974
she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of	 29.284617849322558
seeing him.	 56.20250946993053
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses,	 21.26059523967665
the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its	 32.12786188445452
engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment	 61.097141513749044
of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family	 22.095093609946144
dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always	 70.20791114408051
made part of it, of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and	 57.379737286915045
on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's	 20.17079209834292
warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing	 44.82463352008104
them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference	 51.2435528472426
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she	 13.697272849960838
resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left	 31.5108247026697
Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such	 38.51241818754161
an attachment.	 194.28830868504244
To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,	 42.25008747710478
unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,	 41.329036024552316
before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part	 56.606115705341736
of Derbyshire, to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many	 54.33092051711153
acquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since	 89.16587993047747
the death of Darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power	 30.22526526845395
to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had	 26.62606409668408
been in the way of procuring.	 27.135095415200574
Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by	 20.59536435426491
character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject	 90.94537057556485
of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley, with the	 32.554587195594486
minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her	 82.83808074747067
tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was	 27.26268353204645
delighting both him and herself. On being made acquainted with the	 36.94283509441709
present Mr. Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of	 25.445953456728127
that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree	 63.45164484008107
with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard	 39.66420985398095
Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured	 53.280081572320086
boy.	 8.776652323334677
CHAPTER III.	 12.911953956184709
Mrs. Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on	 31.208931497824455
the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after	 21.751568175916024
honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:	 36.05906441813562
"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you	 56.35456831167156
are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking	 28.01884440963035
openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve	 56.94636037546839
yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of	 27.450721341944607
fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against	 41.2065792034567
_him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he	 22.318673867002843
ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is--you	 39.21030429201776
must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all	 37.354389007630076
expect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and	 75.93770140473626
good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father."	 14.651819927037442
"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."	 38.621676891323915
"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."	 20.830957121433933
"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of	 23.57267316644703
myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I	 31.93625565634909
can prevent it."	 65.75694462550683
"Elizabeth, you are not serious now."	 25.208800005645426
"I beg your pardon. I will try again. At present I am not in love with	 17.699435780020174
Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,	 89.70330532111517
the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to	 20.201809525675404
me--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence	 41.289980718044895
of it.--Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy!--My father's opinion of me does	 52.45346182884927
me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My	 24.807957854729164
father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I	 34.052071145095006
should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but	 20.569706572961895
since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are	 50.940238334870315
seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into	 70.99907573401643
engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many	 43.17789354883973
of my fellow creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it	 42.18620072500244
would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not	 22.42456400378069
to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first	 19.84494777394734
object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short,	 30.26130938655485
I will do my best."	 49.961012992762875
"Perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very	 28.62507383812332
often. At least, you should not _remind_ your Mother of inviting him."	 33.02845391397029
"As I did the other day," said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; "very	 26.56363266024639
true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine	 34.550623321787505
that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been	 28.573857750300732
so frequently invited this week. You know my mother's ideas as to the	 33.731132823635676
necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my	 60.74110987055251
honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now, I hope you	 22.562787396332507
are satisfied."	 177.160968111382
Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth having thanked her for	 32.52447137392234
the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice	 29.46963266144414
being given on such a point, without being resented.	 48.86945083290441
Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted	 31.01143476115119
by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases,	 47.58221551977306
his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was	 34.35538011613158
now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think	 25.47344103859822
it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that	 21.251657229104797
she "_wished_ they might be happy." Thursday was to be the wedding day,	 45.233917184694654
and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose	 31.003268975475418
to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and	 26.98283111605238
reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her	 28.1467128190179
out of the room. As they went down stairs together, Charlotte said,	 32.281726111489306
"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza."	 36.80318675360576
"_That_ you certainly shall."	 48.0966057744839
"And I have another favour to ask. Will you come and see me?"	 51.85537850052034
"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire."	 47.775085942423544
"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to	 15.032040308818369
come to Hunsford."	 88.85797314341379
Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the	 24.451023253116205
visit.	 4164.504307858599
"My father and Maria are to come to me in March," added Charlotte, "and	 41.3732640354515
I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be	 17.38083948716473
as welcome to me as either of them."	 54.29133946424124
The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from	 24.895755454989033
the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the	 30.78545777870604
subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their	 48.688500813476544
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it	 38.9132739670738
should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never	 78.10321614090175
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,	 55.730560653541225
and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the	 26.773242205822473
sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte's first letters	 60.27669492778696
were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be	 22.551928797078677
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would	 44.6769962078314
like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to	 35.84147948903413
be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte	 54.59951280837302
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She	 27.50758050548002
wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing	 112.11478110285836
which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and	 57.71589584265036
roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most	 38.74906167358986
friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and	 30.939874006193307
Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait	 48.46944913127686
for her own visit there, to know the rest.	 58.42614143494769
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their	 13.664876647845995
safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it	 51.23814357218505
would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.	 20.126494346030167
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience	 36.15102955158413
generally is. Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or	 74.02313915908795
hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that	 57.912482305185826
her last letter to her friend from Longbourn, had by some accident been	 50.27007783256242
lost.	 7991.902524097421
"My aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the	 52.29201442568935
town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor-street."	 24.068022113172443
She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.	 33.38059714349581
"I did not think Caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very	 34.98368478808173
glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming	 36.86064116187891
to London. I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.	 71.6626647291296
I enquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much	 55.42847027933431
engaged with Mr. Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that	 52.63768443472557
Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was	 38.74573464158584
not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall	 34.03758005326275
soon see them here."	 363.7341222374078
Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her, that	 48.00955615203982
accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in town.	 68.75262911305201
Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to	 23.02251697953782
persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be	 19.138415646416664
blind to Miss Bingley's inattention. After waiting at home every morning	 39.872090096827556
for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the	 49.52301638318837
visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,	 28.490047070206355
the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no	 38.43392948536806
longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will	 42.8077255268412
prove what she felt.	 95.06821308855523
"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in	 21.45322721884077
her better judgment, at my expence, when I confess myself to have	 32.26540954744783
been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me. But, my	 23.392079323654908
dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me	 60.38690319599649
obstinate if I still assert, that, considering what her behaviour	 59.830115582499104
was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at	 32.84126375069452
all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but	 67.34892508819544
if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should	 33.02676510164551
be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;	 51.92678035476151
and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the mean time. When	 80.43978114735224
she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it;	 16.260784204263565
she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said	 60.72117085355362
not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so	 21.971337403034152
altered a creature, that when she went away, I was perfectly	 63.74902639270061
resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I	 66.32167598285564
cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out as	 34.21497049338476
she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on	 68.66920518692258
her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been	 44.77322726749831
acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her	 33.50827418892448
brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and	 23.763435742919388
though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she	 53.37639377830724
feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so	 43.31968856432144
deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may	 55.90990152079511
feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder,	 64.5187376136927
however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at	 61.404929321496
all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. He knows of my	 41.802236967984
being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and	 35.63639591863188
yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to	 38.733036271669015
persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot	 20.033206899381923
understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should	 21.17994075405751
be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of	 24.729868102922783
duplicity in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful	 31.71920809767995
thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,	 108.03129997523845
and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear	 13.40591934028201
from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never	 59.57835507110524
returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not	 51.80143672997058
with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely	 38.74641832721693
glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at	 47.895060120752824
Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am	 32.34186662351358
sure you will be very comfortable there.	 21.028747694467427
"Your's, &c."	 79.3466902163023
This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she	 66.71347390981533
considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.	 31.263918865424742
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not	 38.26333120131581
even wish for any renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every	 38.932241155691855
review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible	 23.100423413537765
advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.	 73.37660954591993
Darcy's sister, as, by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly	 42.83441014297671
regret what he had thrown away.	 62.02270562528824
Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise	 50.136461260220436
concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had	 49.69479734198375
such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to	 77.50969789734089
herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,	 63.74812983410904
he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to	 18.54063936012029
see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.	 34.9142469707574
Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied	 29.493403731538976
with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune	 31.372262840498298
permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most	 20.75986016350822
remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself	 34.344832970641725
agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than	 88.64281605766926
in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.	 33.804040907782095
Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to	 33.29583503194444
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was	 28.09366718900456
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very	 81.39321541392208
sincerely wish him happy.	 195.95729228945456
All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the	 32.30776654026794
circumstances, she thus went on:--"I am now convinced, my dear aunt,	 82.13799919201287
that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that	 46.02707384129598
pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name,	 36.11954385965609
and wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial	 50.42728222322735
towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find	 58.826641285483056
out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think	 28.42492593362335
her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My	 20.773920619296998
watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more	 20.14336368403024
interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love	 82.73138621847114
with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.	 23.223264856078753
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take	 69.56861058001405
his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways	 44.161047116776196
of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that	 25.171744070915583
handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the	 41.49155266465444
plain."	 6295.930475980366
CHAPTER IV.	 12.911953956184709
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise	 35.90732039004966
diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and	 42.28708675047242
sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take	 65.65098127508278
Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of	 33.242127939553825
going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan,	 66.75027383574037
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure	 43.707779763579104
as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing	 34.25881305682136
Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was	 22.344330622918136
novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such	 36.325092632108166
uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change	 36.604500016661035
was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her	 41.717377158899296
a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have	 36.72451054178961
been very sorry for any delay. Every thing, however, went on smoothly,	 41.6566872329737
and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch. She was	 31.174958405170994
to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of	 22.258467418696114
spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became	 37.407787762130354
perfect as plan could be.	 63.08593231042124
The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,	 49.68653346993929
and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he	 66.28709713966353
told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.	 56.2464843314492
The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on	 28.043424052833707
his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that	 53.272929387467045
Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the	 33.25772386075927
first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner	 52.960241089844864
of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what	 59.28276196595494
she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their	 20.999310858878175
opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide,	 37.55936361066263
there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her	 34.324696085743525
to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced,	 43.80928752106119
that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the	 25.15495528498243
amiable and pleasing.	 444.30257360299765
Her fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think	 55.24588674625237
him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good	 27.91787655262275
humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that	 39.67138879922812
could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight	 69.77748166770239
as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had	 20.250520468010706
known Sir William's too long. He could tell her nothing new of the	 36.19742658512239
wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn	 16.406122352850627
out like his information.	 187.7244765149472
It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early	 40.26181849052844
as to be in Gracechurch-street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's	 30.800339146554585
door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when	 50.530319879150966
they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,	 38.45143327401127
looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and	 36.40583891754636
lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,	 31.74905851239747
whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to	 26.706167348160132
wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her	 31.087278133997607
for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and	 68.79312999785733
kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and	 54.97862561613262
shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.	 13.48614820144413
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first subject was her	 53.14338510090709
sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to	 27.016228103633484
her minute enquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her	 54.46392378296139
spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to	 26.491779633498222
hope, that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the	 17.448258123581112
particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch-street, and	 57.37498162933505
repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and	 32.67968786357498
herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the	 53.74241093256118
acquaintance.	 617.5701551018765
Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and	 29.704138407750296
complimented her on bearing it so well.	 45.81628583732511
"But, my dear Elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is Miss King? I	 18.25750573800456
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary."	 16.05864947969773
"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,	 24.007380209529583
between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,	 55.51994248049736
and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,	 29.04617588244277
because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a	 19.380479355988797
girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is	 21.235411793112103
mercenary."	 3316.0297255954856
"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know	 18.881266963229184
what to think."	 74.0383687591955
"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her."	 15.079100055817452
"But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's	 50.14401338331122
death made her mistress of this fortune."	 61.49584627878716
"No--why should he? If it was not allowable for him to gain _my_	 27.84946569388789
affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for	 55.175960643344936
making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally	 40.53224077022551
poor?"	 2460.98093384194
"But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so	 27.91470005048494
soon after this event."	 50.72438711190555
"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant	 33.26699561365732
decorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,	 23.064765729339786
why should _we_?"	 104.69899497199167
"_Her_ not objecting, does not justify _him_. It only shews her being	 45.32814662194254
deficient in something herself--sense or feeling."	 56.248164684473636
"Well," cried Elizabeth, "have it as you choose. _He_ shall be	 60.6193022952504
mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish."	 87.85780636807671
"No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,	 36.38309623051383
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire."	 15.841151985252543
"Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in	 21.294354377162456
Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not	 41.27150553520007
much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow	 19.4558166423648
where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has	 37.73947069509089
neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones	 97.40958404742737
worth knowing, after all."	 315.47995367500727
"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment."	 76.79159902020152
Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the	 25.591695640392746
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in	 31.016263661669008
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.	 46.34737733856861
"We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said Mrs.	 68.24763247401022
Gardiner, "but perhaps to the Lakes."	 91.20072821728752
No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her	 28.41202665019862
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. "My dear, dear	 34.70466096991129
aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight! what felicity! You give me	 72.83095455007548
fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are men	 50.976554931096366
to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And	 35.776045481874306
when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without	 26.13521194042233
being able to give one accurate idea of any thing. We _will_ know where	 42.41023958021552
we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains,	 33.965089861867405
and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when	 48.29321088881258
we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling	 49.660998225592735
about its relative situation. Let _our_ first effusions be less	 145.1753358942599
insupportable than those of the generality of travellers."	 12.531384936236556
CHAPTER V.	 12.911953956184709
Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to	 56.5241665424455
Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had	 26.613217558121562
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,	 31.312617966689515
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.	 16.97229020722988
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in	 26.675421718102204
search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.	 27.396465247595227
The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth	 17.498710695182027
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.	 25.71618911792049
At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the road,	 32.056294514526655
the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every	 26.58608399359933
thing declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at	 44.128000331503046
the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a	 20.404037170261816
short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole	 26.65313753559058
party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the	 19.305913417903927
sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest	 23.611382982455673
pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when	 73.55125603846152
she found herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her	 32.355005832553765
cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility	 31.587414910790358
was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate	 41.460512477717145
to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family. They were then,	 44.62505709600589
with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance,	 21.24042790048646
taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he	 17.13432167981241
welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble	 26.69788008426338
abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.	 45.0329987992521
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help	 12.617243827068835
fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect	 23.167553191481677
and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if	 32.622289187419625
wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though	 29.332670433340194
every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him	 23.983759623503143
by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend	 45.04764572431994
that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion. When Mr.	 41.58428466880097
Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,	 67.26726296051318
which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on	 44.791531887134084
Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general	 29.452217261611718
Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire every	 39.024205170813474
article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to	 19.418752471004957
give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London,	 38.935339844791095
Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large	 21.15852264037497
and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.	 40.86567732520864
To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and	 24.055010001071697
Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked	 64.8560919989219
of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as	 18.988408750132926
much as possible. Here, leading the way through every walk and cross	 30.713195740717346
walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he	 31.946588449890537
asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left	 66.82702155183779
beauty entirely behind. He could number the fields in every direction,	 41.06091933283473
and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump. But	 30.873788119750742
of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom	 53.91492063128035
could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings,	 28.215028807888682
afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly	 68.52847569515215
opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome modern building, well	 42.782002265349625
situated on rising ground.	 35.468338208096384
From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows,	 31.42585718548942
but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white	 24.403023807703903
frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte	 28.173308630844684
took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,	 40.93723238962436
probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's	 45.869748754698115
help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every	 74.76114938904558
thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of	 20.541155188412837
which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be	 56.25111172803998
forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by	 42.489858923934904
Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often	 55.0005448949075
forgotten.	 3802.419885523714
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It	 21.803934751947867
was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining	 33.46087983689766
in, observed,	 370.3269692365401
"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine	 31.040966983303488
de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will	 25.200753377956488
be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I	 30.032942314115704
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when	 30.94726052914859
service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will	 44.91679496215141
include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she	 61.84221927488889
honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is	 41.30620042916585
charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to	 42.055554211632746
walk home. Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us. I	 48.00808751821578
_should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several."	 52.60919439829867
"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added	 17.034204430856864
Charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour."	 33.544968526235394
"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of	 18.603114370364718
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference."	 101.47590441021498
The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and	 43.21568305316727
telling again what had been already written; and when it closed,	 68.11659473593835
Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon	 24.610765791358393
Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,	 33.013593912538944
and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it	 33.5886399623623
was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would	 71.32399710727454
pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious	 21.418635107891628
interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with	 10.96960143751201
Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.	 94.27635280819975
About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready	 14.98158751205161
for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in	 46.92714049203406
confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up	 31.051616939828122
stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened the	 43.04013721621363
door, and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with	 51.058990498391374
agitation, cried out,	 74.07202211681864
"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for	 16.53141662218409
there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make	 25.88875428803629
haste, and come down this moment."	 84.90226517316862
Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,	 42.379877158114
and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest	 32.81200788277236
of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the	 40.553252394045465
garden gate.	 521.5216838698078
"And is this all?" cried Elizabeth. "I expected at least that the pigs	 43.069940349854974
were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her	 29.751603053069417
daughter!"	 2681.0246436106154
"La! my dear," said Maria quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not Lady	 33.781427284655486
Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them. The	 47.203368884249656
other is Miss De Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little	 36.859197483851204
creature. Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!"	 35.26654148150522
"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.	 33.538315541662136
Why does she not come in?"	 121.75817733992622
"Oh! Charlotte says, she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours	 53.88579233997252
when Miss De Bourgh comes in."	 20.763856508725723
"I like her appearance," said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. "She	 59.95381781034052
looks sickly and cross.--Yes, she will do for him very well. She will	 41.68704748791005
make him a very proper wife."	 23.287757091548123
Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in	 22.197584903806728
conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high	 40.857355487367336
diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the	 13.327213426864873
greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh	 26.743331772503627
looked that way.	 651.9593732564465
At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and	 38.722274985313234
the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two	 32.18334903418305
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which	 35.74558317449103
Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked	 45.080465276852166
to dine at Rosings the next day.	 25.14107058215877
CHAPTER VI.	 12.911953956184709
Mr. Collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete.	 20.028664010122984
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering	 13.854101213042723
visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his	 93.52171422072405
wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of	 42.279888126625856
doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady	 55.95825095538881
Catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.	 39.330444719681275
"I confess," said he, "that I should not have been at all surprised by	 18.265783131460257
her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at	 26.678492232448914
Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it	 34.86615634092983
would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who	 58.956298510326484
could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there	 36.53610211368818
(an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after	 26.20330577764889
your arrival!"	 237.18940443828677
"I am the less surprised at what has happened," replied Sir William,	 28.72350196426224
"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which	 91.58400964815948
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the Court, such	 19.942890252283757
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."	 12.386017424314408
Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but	 33.55725852044725
their visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in	 29.567882903934127
what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many	 28.696539341806126
servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.	 51.104882659449615
When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,	 21.78209399226347
"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady	 14.462921917100994
Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which	 68.5387207836081
becomes herself and daughter. I would advise you merely to put on	 49.15753456705578
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion	 26.356745958309844
for any thing more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for	 39.41943534506765
being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank	 26.87941439574107
preserved."	 8.776652323334677
While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different	 27.520131182158003
doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much	 71.35368010748407
objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.--Such formidable accounts of	 15.347379065619842
her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas,	 35.66745610189824
who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her	 22.465007656711002
introduction at Rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had	 41.456078679706344
done to his presentation at St. James's.	 22.22550665509303
As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile	 55.61005949566744
across the park.--Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and	 48.65135124856679
Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such	 25.43768009318438
raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but	 40.64647623866073
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the	 15.818911928630227
house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally	 46.120701137207476
cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh.	 110.97471116882197
When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every	 38.57995499691181
moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly	 33.30277446888939
calm.--Elizabeth's courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of	 16.72380386529697
Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or	 32.02267007710896
miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she	 27.174103381949436
thought she could witness without trepidation.	 36.463454303572206
From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a	 22.31583294867525
rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed	 119.97906661265029
the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine,	 32.3262923078073
her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting.--Her Ladyship, with great	 48.032770120201874
condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it	 42.04016535679847
with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was	 22.196823823742626
performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks	 41.20700199444053
which he would have thought necessary.	 16.91018447771858
In spite of having been at St. James's, Sir William was so completely	 15.57658336564614
awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage	 30.959181854577036
enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;	 17.762783139945373
and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge	 20.642831963984708
of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself	 83.91246404910899
quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her	 37.19603057726297
composedly.--Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with	 27.817387262264354
strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome. Her air	 48.830651296947266
was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to	 54.05202707235668
make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered	 34.28383553257425
formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so	 69.049384137872
authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr.	 64.4487315909781
Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the	 32.7887119114494
day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had	 30.987048925208292
represented.	 8209.092228515536
When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment	 37.51318209378612
she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the	 22.826222232638735
daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment, at her	 75.03056928074517
being so thin, and so small. There was neither in figure nor face, any	 43.74708604960631
likeness between the ladies. Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly; her	 11.67373964518452
features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very	 61.27177744830329
little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance	 19.44949677351742
there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening	 20.89239908270821
to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before	 30.36627477505244
her eyes.	 92.61072267224485
After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows,	 12.032072250656979
to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its	 46.117616399906034
beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much	 27.09255838750224
better worth looking at in the summer.	 36.80216136340692
The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,	 40.13502315454058
and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he	 18.663760025593113
had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by	 25.873125606198524
her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish	 45.664337080689094
nothing greater.--He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted	 34.66250298486647
alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir	 47.37815389301034
William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law	 36.736909725068735
said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.	 42.79312903953226
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and	 17.681675765907933
gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved	 45.856253811233465
a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth	 46.537187751777154
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated	 31.522298775453997
between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in	 64.10442795628167
listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all	 37.152240542528546
dinner time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little	 31.005197707107353
Miss De Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she	 27.7983996866965
were indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the	 25.321881649734436
gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.	 96.68928579014724
When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be	 20.76626824094307
done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any	 58.918517038998566
intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every	 67.61170549981655
subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have	 26.748367418260194
her judgment controverted. She enquired into Charlotte's domestic	 49.17388938448624
concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice,	 25.875177781496962
as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be	 18.281953255123717
regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the	 15.963603571114428
care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was	 25.793148621811234
beneath this great Lady's attention, which could furnish her with an	 34.46320082972581
occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with	 23.784690904099676
Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and	 44.46542551664809
Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew	 42.05846949380389
the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel,	 33.08151807524559
pretty kind of girl. She asked her at different times, how many sisters	 33.64470488698584
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of	 49.128803362765844
them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they	 36.318613449793475
had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her	 37.467786519851785
mother's maiden name?--Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her	 28.808228419963417
questions, but answered them very composedly.--Lady Catherine then	 207.69155314470228
observed,	 2828.4902232359277
"Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your	 29.59550120082596
sake," turning to Charlotte, "I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no	 97.0485568391385
occasion for entailing estates from the female line.--It was not thought	 39.50626734992743
necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family.--Do you play and sing, Miss	 113.11391344807215
Bennet?"	 400.0597342633047
"A little."	 79.45334843614422
"Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our	 41.50516599188011
instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it	 60.60755605441557
some day.--Do your sisters play and sing?"	 44.59865835221073
"One of them does."	 59.26795010416131
"Why did not you all learn?--You ought all to have learned. The Miss	 56.01411988067921
Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as	 61.368434438433226
your's.--Do you draw?"	 29.313568240083573
"No, not at all."	 41.95995992662923
"What, none of you?"	 68.31698349381686
"Not one."	 99.40516552183246
"That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother	 25.536500243717295
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters."	 40.298281549488365
"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London."	 42.83344027483766
"Has your governess left you?"	 155.05682236061443
"We never had any governess."	 37.035544248984955
"No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home	 67.32702656942594
without a governess!--I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must	 42.98222345016733
have been quite a slave to your education."	 29.300928038734586
Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not	 20.114633330305477
been the case.	 136.74851717484154
"Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess you must	 47.364173771958335
have been neglected."	 17.69966087390791
"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as	 60.96940989238977
wished to learn, never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to	 34.65152596261011
read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be	 37.200503920976146
idle, certainly might."	 774.3338862370622
"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had	 40.808704362588564
known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage	 27.222878963521445
one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady	 34.09957227883427
and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is	 35.529913881657485
wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that	 16.091952412169565
way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces	 39.29357783609721
of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and	 54.655734726782796
it was but the other day, that I recommended another young person, who	 40.156541376091425
was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite	 50.58841557600198
delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe's	 85.03626787390326
calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. 'Lady	 79.42960609768315
Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of your	 39.873110221847604
younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?"	 81.57812509480975
"Yes, Ma'am, all."	 49.13961141262736
"All!--What, all five out at once? Very odd!--And you only the	 85.7844754165139
second.--The younger ones out before the elder are married!--Your	 25.427597610820694
younger sisters must be very young?"	 40.100377108148294
"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much	 49.649575572938936
in company. But really, Ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon	 22.93183770343146
younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and	 16.634453814338084
amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to	 55.02558960328057
marry early.--The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of	 78.2732401749328
youth, as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive!--I think it	 50.59292376206385
would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of	 21.388406541852614
mind."	 4205.8057904202615
"Upon my word," said her Ladyship, "you give your opinion very	 32.707815608680434
decidedly for so young a person.--Pray, what is your age?"	 48.07335889484142
"With three younger sisters grown up," replied Elizabeth smiling, "your	 54.603448784884904
Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."	 57.66175246274865
Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;	 37.59460478206905
and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever	 18.681807925815225
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.	 46.635815399155376
"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not	 21.47630136229904
conceal your age."	 318.13827759592255
"I am not one and twenty."	 42.96828558442006
When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables	 26.87625508720679
were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat	 40.83794051552068
down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the	 23.33270423660358
two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her	 20.925653518267026
party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was	 84.71137876119835
uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson	 19.23501348479764
expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or	 60.82191912616774
having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the	 42.78244467058258
other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes	 29.194500482451332
of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins	 43.56947444577483
was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her	 36.79801455596908
for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.	 36.36665742436416
Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes	 24.98073599967687
and noble names.	 193.3742168052822
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,	 30.96742196417698
the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,	 28.804266932465456
gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. The party then gathered	 42.306607092165294
round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were	 54.87248313519226
to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the	 27.17118500685866
arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.	 30.684345384891607
Collins's side, and as many bows on Sir William's, they departed. As	 85.34321587235047
soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her	 25.16968033894856
cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which,	 30.834174652759046
for Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But	 61.899334671347276
her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means	 29.222352058049548
satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship's	 27.17464726603376
praise into his own hands.	 67.39466602444763
CHAPTER VII.	 12.911953956184709
Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough	 21.723730218552806
to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of	 27.789959969242187
her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met	 39.848224225571926
with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his mornings	 39.525606523075936
to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he	 28.50560463306439
went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and	 22.617983542592864
Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin	 24.610626918351723
by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and	 15.741777546883798
dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading	 57.4651586308315
and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which	 43.00296771206027
fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.	 30.05342630924235
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer	 32.032397417236226
the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a	 43.807391666049945
pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent	 30.779682058875736
reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been	 36.658949361328034
much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and	 48.60732686915878
she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.	 41.244482937248534
From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and	 36.06531817931636
were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went	 34.2269627384539
along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,	 46.60529853816802
which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened	 60.60694290029667
almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had	 36.66861061170465
a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever	 45.61232178948835
prevailed on to get out.	 46.93425584842985
Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and	 17.26023850307189
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;	 21.238588389161617
and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings	 45.42382676159278
to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many	 52.820328482766925
hours. Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,	 26.031577784627473
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during	 30.96656888112723
these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,	 50.94661951817062
and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement	 37.97941453210587
of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she	 21.88996360371824
accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding	 45.702592511744506
out that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.	 30.91632899201752
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the	 29.314752293619463
commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate	 12.689556296419884
in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by	 28.27779817382141
Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be	 28.2407780592116
quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the	 21.175132243570573
village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold	 16.468693379845718
them into harmony and plenty.	 30.78578618988101
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;	 46.92494934716595
and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card	 43.425255551440955
table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of	 22.947111327602265
the first. Their other engagements were few; as the style of living of	 78.93075345111464
the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the Collinses' reach. This	 64.3381376168083
however was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time	 73.66683408180427
comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with	 52.58150356623986
Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she	 29.181138900730087
had often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where	 57.72314278911611
she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was	 23.44867985535824
along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was	 37.53186918645226
a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and	 33.39075485788916
where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.	 17.050608084855227
In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.	 32.151398574707734
Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an	 34.52307805993193
addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be	 22.577410591037335
important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy	 53.70232162865342
was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were	 20.087904482412434
not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would	 37.623280504705704
furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and	 37.56337018265601
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him	 40.28839068248488
were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined	 27.702701923920767
by Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest	 28.625181990504966
satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and	 38.712334769401245
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by	 23.050675391939404
Miss Lucas and herself.	 82.33819006086573
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage, for Mr. Collins was walking	 29.267633557380538
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,	 14.782174287996039
in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow	 34.55593332850363
as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great	 25.939081523032854
intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his	 39.21792454592837
respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for	 43.10852412454961
Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of	 24.381249139727224
his uncle, Lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party, when	 34.383867957846725
Mr. Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen	 19.56773502064728
them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running	 35.01717016250343
into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,	 84.43183293938424
"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would	 31.71848735339656
never have come so soon to wait upon me."	 90.04629299095164
Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,	 32.83799880695406
before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly	 27.43763969030567
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,	 23.396002074838258
who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and	 101.40787638621477
address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been	 37.05397091493947
used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual	 50.441789139435805
reserve, to Mrs. Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her	 20.82277027329517
friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely	 62.65825726560892
curtseyed to him, without saying a word.	 14.313685913766346
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the	 21.095186259467642
readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but	 27.117550247094414
his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and	 18.966837003173357
garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body.	 30.35436375159635
At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of	 28.019589474128534
Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual	 23.915018426609436
way, and after a moment's pause, added,	 25.56810546644134
"My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never	 25.791296005189476
happened to see her there?"	 46.61019819348716
She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see	 20.11796562108693
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the	 17.516920021129252
Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he	 44.20906345245063
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The	 19.67993330705213
subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went	 33.22475176396796
away.	 3305.001899524869
CHAPTER VIII.	 12.911953956184709
Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage,	 19.947692047792277
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of	 28.68741457148275
their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they	 23.390717308935887
received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the	 30.628662177132217
house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,	 45.547521459925406
almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by	 44.81753750863124
such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to	 44.361188819703926
come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little	 33.5654766801373
of either Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called	 57.51605284785864
at the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had	 20.54977515584625
only seen at church.	 244.72347326482898
The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined	 56.36943523462296
the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room. Her ladyship received them	 40.11419834512525
civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so	 16.694543016337587
acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,	 26.77854734354287
almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,	 27.68528070218279
much more than to any other person in the room.	 17.690926218953212
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a	 17.28159775294221
welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had	 38.93792447458612
moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and	 59.05049739165731
talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying	 108.21885851077937
at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so	 46.14099903539037
well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much	 67.27493997897078
spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as	 29.03877245902752
well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned	 52.31708501668384
towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a	 32.265887577533576
while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not	 27.329015497153893
scruple to call out,	 39.423257112916055
"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking	 21.058080645327966
of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is."	 14.234570876668283
"We are speaking of music, Madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid	 24.57437346105522
a reply.	 502.83608101364536
"Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I	 34.37086495119394
must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.	 36.459069405349226
There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment	 20.254035427098508
of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I	 38.509981402682996
should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health	 47.552446681544545
had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed	 22.705205292465855
delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?"	 134.98356574568982
Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.	 27.59270772270601
"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said Lady	 19.70742583668829
Catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,	 43.84075004088349
if she does not practise a great deal."	 15.565981751969122
"I assure you, Madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice.	 20.542227154517043
She practises very constantly."	 34.80827662529037
"So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write	 38.758669903528265
to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often	 53.05470861003362
tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired,	 54.792734485692726
without constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that	 25.62621505505844
she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though	 37.48413074160471
Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often	 30.721873488712784
told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in	 46.66539820464468
Mrs. Jenkinson's room. She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that	 68.97444449897537
part of the house."	 22.040815062468678
Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made	 22.819084775727507
no answer.	 104.82691787327784
When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having	 29.595070824420933
promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He	 31.38209757471158
drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then	 35.82335109903466
talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from	 37.89349598230895
her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte,	 46.270921762073456
stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's	 29.557667500075592
countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first	 55.13458768619338
convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,	 47.832034458040205
"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear	 28.76647137417503
me? But I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well.	 21.511113461035062
There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at	 30.000174086761323
the will of others. My courage always rises with every attempt to	 53.25095238227086
intimidate me."	 46.457861253467364
"I shall not say that you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could	 15.492998359286602
not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I	 17.192968447102313
have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you	 22.73752566724519
find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact	 96.23373074756698
are not your own."	 59.3944359096301
Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to	 28.888967184417474
Colonel Fitzwilliam, "Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of	 17.747251863769094
me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky	 29.37259472864639
in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a	 31.99752470972457
part of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree	 29.91290732368029
of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention	 45.847977976483726
all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me	 44.11197889421988
leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,	 25.401080229704853
and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear."	 55.69035397666026
"I am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly.	 11.904786733131392
"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried Colonel	 23.587896221594058
Fitzwilliam. "I should like to know how he behaves among strangers."	 31.96104342289985
"You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.	 53.30886065887478
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,	 39.82774763504466
was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced	 42.678064548728145
only four dances! I am sorry to pain you--but so it was. He danced only	 44.003220786727546
four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge,	 64.82750841862318
more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr.	 35.73864099819747
Darcy, you cannot deny the fact."	 47.33897933427427
"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly	 34.14015619810858
beyond my own party."	 86.05984376415479
"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room. Well, Colonel	 84.66066406254413
Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders."	 107.75038092563832
"Perhaps," said Darcy, "I should have judged better, had I sought an	 79.02991554060357
introduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers."	 38.73268196994306
"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said Elizabeth, still	 52.47499913369189
addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. "Shall we ask him why a man of sense and	 20.49655385541162
education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend	 30.729617799432113
himself to strangers?"	 129.8027116349836
"I can answer your question," said Fitzwilliam, "without applying to	 30.936408830035795
him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble."	 46.00538139293658
"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said Darcy,	 47.92534376466791
"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot	 43.10614301709897
catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their	 46.92104502350536
concerns, as I often see done."	 81.74515681467902
"My fingers," said Elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the	 33.28021022689922
masterly manner which I see so many women's do. They have not the same	 32.951204601280864
force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I	 44.337987190664194
have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take the	 20.61788225928987
trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as	 19.572181535486322
capable as any other woman's of superior execution."	 87.42519502687973
Darcy smiled and said, "You are perfectly right. You have employed your	 38.69210145937357
time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can	 41.1427198397625
think any thing wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers."	 42.97801256020524
Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know	 22.727127145669378
what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.	 26.72229880146326
Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said	 19.38689489564234
to Darcy,	 234.69823089251003
"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and	 23.19804811376232
could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion	 19.984514601518732
of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's. Anne would have	 34.41923997956019
been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn."	 50.00427260935599
Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his	 23.358966698456666
cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she	 58.429310672967034
discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss	 21.339558770129425
De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have	 33.44382658051944
been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.	 54.876136193063935
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing	 36.635627317141065
with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received	 77.09023573922745
them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the	 16.36581678615245
gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was	 18.888713638492764
ready to take them all home.	 58.20219722865055
CHAPTER IX.	 12.911953956184709
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane,	 23.63622349093716
while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,	 24.349333691156495
when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a	 24.958921719385874
visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be	 21.43624980482881
Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her	 41.53479333015542
half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,	 41.856887785393006
when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr.	 25.716690334632343
Darcy only, entered the room.	 42.746506460849695
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his	 35.81292335735167
intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to	 26.333619905843165
be within.	 271.7023107867283
They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were made,	 32.09272797808697
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely	 55.16088915652494
necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence	 68.25373340148379
recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling	 36.8730407929131
curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty	 18.140834095325907
departure, she observed,	 59.76179813693228
"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!	 100.89865697764046
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you	 18.666121370748623
all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day	 103.38627614260373
before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London."	 82.74225024246272
"Perfectly so--I thank you."	 141.48068812304604
She found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short	 27.69604456684328
pause, added,	 159.26599890074516
"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever	 27.179057462645723
returning to Netherfield again?"	 28.11364688422641
"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend	 19.17296500505776
very little of his time there in future. He has many friends, and he is	 96.15896518677262
at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually	 78.68625232215896
increasing."	 7208.241702827903
"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the	 29.23016373972937
neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we	 47.25823703481565
might possibly get a settled family there. But perhaps Mr. Bingley did	 45.71526182537185
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as	 24.533129966284342
for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same	 34.23990774910681
principle."	 8.776652323334677
"I should not be surprised," said Darcy, "if he were to give it up, as	 24.617555426397523
soon as any eligible purchase offers."	 33.64513646727133
Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his	 18.47665051525652
friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the	 39.9310303548875
trouble of finding a subject to him.	 41.18356717077512
He took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very comfortable	 41.05181108628347
house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.	 58.07709884382687
Collins first came to Hunsford."	 48.479640807384506
"I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her	 17.725266062174313
kindness on a more grateful object."	 48.88641158857352
"Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife."	 33.85067868980568
"Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of	 28.694611349587834
the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made	 27.479592861592597
him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though	 46.919455535818116
I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest	 30.09404226636656
thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a	 53.96281732126705
prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her."	 16.964878644220555
"It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a	 27.653687034315276
distance of her own family and friends."	 64.3614234136736
"An easy distance do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles."	 31.08362382329175
"And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day's	 38.15158636680095
journey. Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance."	 55.35454218507148
"I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_	 38.44786237743846
of the match," cried Elizabeth. "I should never have said Mrs. Collins	 33.569034028171515
was settled _near_ her family."	 34.422101458913154
"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Any thing beyond	 20.202798103305437
the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far."	 66.5381258284881
As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she	 21.878333718797762
understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and	 35.47547226897693
Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,	 48.91828038140463
"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her	 17.74695236471017
family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many	 102.78349880245649
varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expence of	 26.850723466142806
travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the	 54.66457666896975
case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not	 50.92530688617892
such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my	 65.57562404243384
friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_	 34.959225685215976
the present distance."	 34.610861794733665
Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "_You_ cannot	 60.529599766091586
have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have	 33.760158022851854
been always at Longbourn."	 87.93601231538378
Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of	 50.12805130857344
feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,	 55.27502527781973
glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,	 30.78856143414641
"Are you pleased with Kent?"	 46.25224833540979
A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side	 20.412918198039158
calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte	 17.720355201920782
and her sister, just returned from their walk. The tête-à-tête surprised	 28.92562798181298
them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding	 27.84243741950426
on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying	 10.693045046555575
much to any body, went away.	 23.25386236758368
"What can be the meaning of this!" said Charlotte, as soon as he was	 21.82198644716742
gone. "My dear Eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have	 24.98311888919718
called on us in this familiar way."	 32.27661530645079
But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,	 72.7916372428025
even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various	 36.64055783924674
conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from	 41.69529502680289
the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable	 54.79003016487192
from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there	 31.309618573195674
was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be	 27.13880071187505
always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the	 20.000013941632915
pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the	 33.13978865041013
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither	 40.96619458827684
almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes	 30.209594660139405
separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their	 47.285223268349284
aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he	 22.75137254214031
had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended	 71.27943290712348
him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in	 27.14305498607403
being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her	 32.654050817850624
former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw	 23.758644636799126
there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,	 19.938839911889
she believed he might have the best informed mind.	 31.23342168862279
But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult	 66.82397709190363
to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there	 46.38558735282741
ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it	 28.52657154199147
seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to	 44.72963989067041
propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really	 97.33421824657358
animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel	 53.47515115176249
Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was	 47.88702161333414
generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told	 60.19836081488516
her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of	 42.84272992315602
love, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself	 59.836292571821815
seriously to work to find it out.--She watched him whenever they were at	 44.763786504654604
Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He	 39.926364514006146
certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that	 31.76043911713292
look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often	 47.32487991268637
doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it	 65.39486901711727
seemed nothing but absence of mind.	 112.21705588643208
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his	 29.583640223937675
being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.	 29.367930659405168
Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of	 20.02236110985952
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her	 45.470532795293515
opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would	 96.85879641833304
vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.	 16.24364954935998
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying	 97.80160622019133
Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he	 37.79883503729248
certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,	 25.519954315715534
to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage	 22.941843816945127
in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.	 34.18247529433963
CHAPTER X.	 12.911953956184709
More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly	 46.08519663984271
meet Mr. Darcy.--She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that	 34.83046710893537
should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever	 43.07698652457598
happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a	 30.944367264931063
favourite haunt of hers.--How it could occur a second time therefore was	 37.69280465362092
very odd!--Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like wilful	 93.3107727747573
ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not	 18.2264201934497
merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he	 33.94527384926823
actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never	 55.493942141466675
said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of	 37.434041627423454
listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre	 29.592968604745785
that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in	 43.55104302318505
being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr.	 45.51330133738602
and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her	 26.719335658166
not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever	 46.030418135690574
she came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too. His words	 55.93914868145887
seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts?	 46.16425606107562
She supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what	 62.38649908833431
might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was	 21.97080657297972
quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the	 26.93243643586459
Parsonage.	 3818.0991242085106
She was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing Jane's last	 86.05384971035156
letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not	 24.41174588612698
written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy,	 49.720645279283836
she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting	 46.93900987663758
away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,	 64.53596249896161
"I did not know before that you ever walked this way."	 38.888154974365044
"I have been making the tour of the Park," he replied, "as I generally	 37.281640319851135
do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are	 32.15616438299271
you going much farther?"	 409.7834945081388
"No, I should have turned in a moment."	 44.59887863321823
And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage	 30.842787815078882
together.	 1306.2245712140734
"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?" said she.	 45.594167341527424
"Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He	 22.601824122965482
arranges the business just as he pleases."	 32.24642532258432
"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least	 46.32222458061264
great pleasure in the power of choice. I do not know any body who seems	 16.257543133270666
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy."	 37.93297232671771
"He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.	 36.511693226757814
"But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than	 60.34593883240997
many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak	 42.363629530150604
feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and	 23.266584190191566
dependence."	 4457.450851624783
"In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little of	 33.24913842677644
either. Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and	 72.46317955659522
dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going	 93.89167985460996
wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?"	 46.61235941009814
"These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have	 40.35575798865027
experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater	 59.174744127896474
weight, I may suffer from the want of money. Younger sons cannot marry	 44.51725689784745
where they like."	 138.43745685040767
"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often	 85.13799382383723
do."	 500.3182253163882
"Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in	 61.287666879516195
my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to	 70.83503030176863
money."	 1569.7718828140833
"Is this," thought Elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she coloured at the	 44.271473677217294
idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "And pray, what is	 36.98160625411825
the usual price of an Earl's younger son? Unless the elder brother is	 21.078366733555534
very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."	 22.11729152819926
He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt	 32.46977174813209
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,	 30.128073229690425
she soon afterwards said,	 59.7603460644888
"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of	 31.09108023273602
having somebody at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a	 27.71704024375928
lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps his sister does as well	 40.370902736958854
for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he	 59.81965609638065
likes with her."	 173.8371524574997
"No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must	 41.77927596339914
divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy."	 22.68458338691691
"Are you, indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your	 60.913073760813035
charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age, are sometimes a	 55.65567764984436
little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she	 39.458198122028634
may like to have her own way."	 65.2138861211425
As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner	 33.951227545721956
in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to	 39.84526307988337
give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other	 34.92587607007109
got pretty near the truth. She directly replied,	 106.90058508290387
"You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare	 18.545888025498524
say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a	 19.725220319891267
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and	 23.56981620663183
Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them."	 22.20929134118915
"I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like	 37.86422510397805
man--he is a great friend of Darcy's."	 53.70617484443844
"Oh! yes," said Elizabeth drily--"Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.	 45.991353410709706
Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him."	 46.7928447625725
"Care of him!--Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in	 29.80783178532671
those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in	 48.49042128175418
our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to	 54.554928197810824
him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that	 20.61584433207627
Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture."	 52.74551300036315
"What is it you mean?"	 47.23501340429856
"It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be	 27.331481345353165
generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family,	 46.92270189526216
it would be an unpleasant thing."	 14.983302473936627
"You may depend upon my not mentioning it."	 21.81546960766053
"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be	 19.407213950494963
Bingley. What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself	 78.47356502705087
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most	 24.320663839623258
imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other	 35.971786653006006
particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him	 35.634125308885594
the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from	 43.2500295939779
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer."	 43.31302411943349
"Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?"	 54.399174623669275
"I understood that there were some very strong objections against the	 17.690713161787556
lady."	 540.1136531019139
"And what arts did he use to separate them?"	 36.281145306795175
"He did not talk to me of his own arts," said Fitzwilliam smiling. "He	 31.25286199182689
only told me, what I have now told you."	 31.788436100032065
Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with	 16.584074990001962
indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she	 37.85655522966939
was so thoughtful.	 41.47922493420093
"I am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she. "Your	 21.244046605745805
cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?"	 82.46000891469495
"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"	 35.41949219867925
"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of	 28.237084807265163
his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to	 41.35927375654753
determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy." "But,"	 46.38862790421681
she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the	 26.179498015194945
particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed	 15.490900794235088
that there was much affection in the case."	 35.356196091461584
"That is not an unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, "but it is	 23.148524422704174
lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."	 48.406004128133695
This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of	 49.0279284519126
Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,	 16.478582325343694
therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent	 65.21334262683739
matters till they reached the parsonage. There, shut into her own room,	 59.31898260779542
as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption	 20.95206726306783
of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other	 14.591506695393473
people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There	 64.19996255295868
could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom Mr. Darcy could have	 23.87591757667604
such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures	 15.654240627572761
taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she	 27.502729163851605
had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and	 21.043438757307797
arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,	 39.475133742087095
_he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that	 30.678213868230465
Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a	 44.652834879934794
while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart	 55.13054010751417
in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have	 26.55277778940143
inflicted.	 8.776652323334677
"There were some very strong objections against the lady," were Colonel	 24.027378291023687
Fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her	 60.20316380451909
having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in	 70.58276720078577
business in London.	 163.54073775455103
"To Jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of	 27.280837140103543
objection. All loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding	 101.9582657060107
excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could	 116.38809321543657
any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some	 58.87669254246299
peculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain,	 34.94376746361688
and respectability which he will probably never reach." When she thought	 63.8224117906794
of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would	 46.45717841058995
not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr.	 33.604820518702006
Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from	 60.73560747340111
the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want	 44.61674363881161
of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly	 12.954410691538751
governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of	 16.99307847931555
retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.	 21.758975286675696
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a	 38.09733099071613
headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to	 58.08236773345442
her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her	 28.486230468335776
cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,	 44.20954810464337
seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much	 35.29748956501043
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but Mr. Collins	 44.92437207823401
could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather	 31.113840644399026
displeased by her staying at home.	 26.970233282229216
CHAPTER XI.	 12.911953956184709
When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as	 23.477957843093524
much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the	 22.909393335126666
examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her	 30.67384551782767
being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any	 66.88097513289517
revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.	 37.3237164417323
But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that	 51.49427565319102
cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,	 21.90079818536133
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly	 24.0182539296243
disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth	 67.8471110706318
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an	 20.272366795612747
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's	 49.832497943897664
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a	 17.684056537840885
keener sense of her sister's sufferings. It was some consolation to	 17.941061690050965
think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,	 40.168266073811736
and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be	 82.28024163018588
with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her	 12.703353811078395
spirits, by all that affection could do.	 80.78558147636393
She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent, without remembering that	 29.396087353496537
his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear	 22.14409593709713
that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not	 27.759696593847135
mean to be unhappy about him.	 43.949951063348024
While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the	 16.8920341756691
door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its	 20.24161891333033
being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in	 37.756940732107736
the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her. But	 37.958524952416056
this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently	 27.062037925453826
affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the	 42.291755044526134
room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her	 34.8674537720354
health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.	 38.955237218064774
She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and	 11.17962621702749
then getting up walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but said	 39.98392006825373
not a word. After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an	 23.31068151406096
agitated manner, and thus began,	 39.80847190666102
"In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be	 28.71949162104549
repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love	 26.22704090940677
you."	 90.8842218880159
Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,	 31.32606920399952
doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement,	 133.35303513645837
and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her,	 29.50140571768834
immediately followed. He spoke well, but there were feelings besides	 99.65974414740339
those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the	 38.115923323268476
subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--of	 55.77392785092679
its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had	 55.24577592612605
always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed	 66.94861858551558
due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to	 39.747969188553895
recommend his suit.	 322.99127209440934
In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to	 13.756451442829905
the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did	 23.039872185882086
not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to	 22.81191827249251
receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost	 64.46947345182649
all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to	 62.990573890072035
answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with	 62.56460639229055
representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of	 19.356547505205107
all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with	 40.4892374544205
expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of	 20.06208960286706
his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of	 38.33669678141954
a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his	 35.75683786896281
countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only	 96.17911451460705
exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her	 45.21532184238112
cheeks, and she said,	 23.38646618497487
"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to	 25.105519101603406
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however	 39.17366724650819
unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be	 53.81951282782032
felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I	 28.384684369862157
cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly	 34.01333245364901
bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any	 25.941848858917517
one. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of	 35.98895977984169
short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the	 49.78781781042279
acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming	 28.041562602112936
it after this explanation."	 149.261463604485
Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed	 26.288044106195862
on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than	 25.7808746886592
surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of	 33.15437575669875
his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the	 21.88793918618337
appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed	 32.72489332456894
himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings	 56.83569940984428
dreadful. At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,	 52.143249997660206
"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I	 21.835603253603846
might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at	 53.30643139715208
civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance."	 54.18494779188587
"I might as well enquire," replied she, "why with so evident a design of	 47.23823685093005
offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me	 16.21125611281629
against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?	 80.95073833634842
Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have	 39.12275993922244
other provocations. You know I have. Had not my own feelings decided	 30.83420446972684
against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been	 86.83472834426026
favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept	 31.10782398678829
the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the	 22.91463966860446
happiness of a most beloved sister?"	 69.26654417349494
As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion	 21.76329211188913
was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she	 40.507752186278104
continued.	 1565.0452216792298
"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can	 23.503902768011375
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,	 60.84343655633689
you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means	 27.747417646544
of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the	 42.38146816922699
world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for	 39.40889629065891
disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest	 26.48427600747597
kind."	 2663.643689825788
She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening	 33.32091146257101
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.	 19.648411975582228
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.	 33.103195943903444
"Can you deny that you have done it?" she repeated.	 30.13655525523057
With assumed tranquillity he then replied, "I have no wish of denying	 29.33244796236682
that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your	 20.584353790023183
sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been	 42.250520684473905
kinder than towards myself."	 90.51407905175593
Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,	 40.54852510777742
but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.	 29.52638648579008
"But it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike	 42.129229044190865
is founded. Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was	 46.200206852849085
decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received	 44.291836013542024
many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to	 39.573064470574955
say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?	 62.25679382331848
or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?"	 97.5522905156035
"You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said Darcy in	 41.40704142110565
a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.	 37.498709464165515
"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an	 85.29694917259387
interest in him?"	 123.70981940550809
"His misfortunes!" repeated Darcy contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes	 84.62814509239733
have been great indeed."	 52.0536869256993
"And of your infliction," cried Elizabeth with energy. "You have reduced	 24.617323646521903
him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty. You have	 19.859208257116038
withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for	 28.416812087279073
him. You have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence	 35.21347814230768
which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this! and	 53.819207990569176
yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and	 41.22169450556761
ridicule."	 8.776652323334677
"And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,	 38.974813966364835
"is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I	 18.498047707967014
thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this	 44.01557323117884
calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps," added he, stopping in his	 36.31352906800029
walk, and turning towards her, "these offences might have been	 26.878088137557036
overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the	 19.907327871881442
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These	 56.72260311320785
bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I with greater policy	 30.960491284425125
concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being	 59.58625086925783
impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by	 57.94835694082778
reflection, by every thing. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.	 60.64554404419765
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just.	 63.31320507602402
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?	 18.831265156315894
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life	 29.54810083856066
is so decidedly beneath my own?"	 34.2754436960544
Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to	 40.50994756270732
the utmost to speak with composure when she said,	 78.41503940227915
"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your	 14.499973151735617
declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the	 22.248650891178954
concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a	 40.02172697920522
more gentleman-like manner."	 44.31329105134675
She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,	 41.80427721667369
"You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way	 26.77374484457244
that would have tempted me to accept it."	 23.021546863643678
Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an	 27.16162195399142
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on.	 23.01102078661327
"From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my	 38.64509976769354
acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest	 48.50413084389616
belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the	 23.2681833571482
feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of	 41.85173683913605
disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a	 45.612240742221
dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the	 39.6703386137717
last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry."	 21.200057797392013
"You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your	 39.012099921246225
feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.	 42.51744498427303
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best	 34.99971664740544
wishes for your health and happiness."	 54.48696182551384
And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him	 38.83252056488751
the next moment open the front door and quit the house.	 36.12039457750499
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great. She knew not how to	 22.506639686804032
support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an	 66.15900547384388
hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was	 49.25573853525554
increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of	 22.454111476589425
marriage from Mr. Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for	 18.86660579856068
so many months! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all	 24.723368951073226
the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her	 29.86135238568174
sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case,	 30.769937064626035
was almost incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously	 24.10601278686798
so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride, his	 112.6409038339007
shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane, his	 23.75751732680414
unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it,	 26.63323940599363
and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his	 30.465691740945335
cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the	 27.15600258236876
pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.	 60.09347572583027
She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady	 37.050393972584544
Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter	 34.28371839312563
Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.	 65.23987102586177
CHAPTER XII.	 12.911953956184709
Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations	 18.007251534225862
which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the	 18.975734640135965
surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing	 17.853055154173543
else, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after	 72.69069177276974
breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding	 32.7047133278845
directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's	 26.81771621906183
sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,	 55.208322075242314
she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road.	 35.44751888209443
The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed	 38.06895669079011
one of the gates into the ground.	 25.657118312335037
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was	 11.711608373280159
tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and	 17.616998464025322
look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent, had	 38.567525953994604
made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the	 16.036945008123332
verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk,	 21.456035982949363
when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which	 20.325778298664883
edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr.	 37.91912550730183
Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced, was now	 51.08988462643474
near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced	 32.37445323552186
her name. She had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in	 43.817896854985065
a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the	 25.949479802743372
gate. He had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter,	 92.9537015547593
which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, "I	 61.89748779114748
have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.	 29.02938817717804
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"--And then, with a	 44.67385162056284
slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of	 28.913874162584673
sight.	 4014.8117263307754
With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,	 33.66263573766039
Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,	 45.89150379428898
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written	 108.35315233474975
quite through, in a very close hand.--The envelope itself was likewise	 63.494835595386256
full.--Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated	 32.26976068596029
from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--	 44.42260947889979
"Be not alarmed, Madam, on receiving this letter, by the	 54.1034229246798
apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments,	 31.353484957331016
or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to	 18.633077364165754
you. I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling	 26.85367388676311
myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both,	 50.58598449409637
cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation,	 30.65301063217735
and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been	 29.239671640030544
spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.	 87.15905072676814
You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your	 27.969646456749487
attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I	 59.53820364993901
demand it of your justice.	 105.27616492279917
"Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal	 33.96744588693905
magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned	 45.138870155527925
was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached	 44.84409475842994
Mr. Bingley from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in	 50.233899993765625
defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity,	 27.508000593996453
ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of Mr.	 14.419671480345526
Wickham.--Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of	 16.0273291239512
my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who	 43.59617081068217
had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who	 28.21997582941666
had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,	 21.168687233219597
to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could	 53.48296999266025
be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.--But	 28.76038576462225
from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally	 16.668708445861046
bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in	 47.62577297285
future secured, when the following account of my actions and their	 50.376639559866014
motives has been read.--If, in the explanation of them which is	 42.23841747706813
due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which	 34.51059230950442
may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am sorry.--The	 20.30116574275688
necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd.--I	 47.473298993273346
had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with	 25.646341310786546
others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other	 64.50928187411681
young woman in the country.--But it was not till the evening of the	 23.34452527234518
dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a	 39.3993952963522
serious attachment.--I had often seen him in love before.--At that	 43.22417523394515
ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made	 51.41802699323312
acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that	 64.13672253497752
Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general	 73.07313489770304
expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain event,	 32.611241149153464
of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I	 43.8477833117847
observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then	 109.09577654885655
perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had	 60.570289253710165
ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also watched.--Her look and	 68.85869808452688
manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any	 52.80937949495072
symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the	 28.902599990927826
evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with	 73.97909753108253
pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of	 19.62545728184675
sentiment.--If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have	 31.958437175238718
been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make	 49.131136997536316
the latter probable.--If it be so, if I have been misled by such	 34.55307369480706
error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been	 81.86211214368612
unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity	 22.521917556952758
of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given	 39.681909048407796
the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her	 51.680849706493866
temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--That I was	 32.18761145411712
desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but I will	 54.409907256306916
venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually	 35.92685115830875
influenced by my hopes or fears.--I did not believe her to be	 17.860250640685702
indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial	 110.84556450337995
conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.--My objections to	 71.45591743395977
the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged	 63.023703779822554
to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my	 33.912281482989776
own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to	 31.438659853757212
my friend as to me.--But there were other causes of	 43.48252732019997
repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to	 25.791254715167774
an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to	 56.80490800969188
forget, because they were not immediately before me.--These causes	 39.002763573952855
must be stated, though briefly.--The situation of your mother's	 35.44331301012242
family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that	 30.713650176890443
total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed	 60.96555458373504
by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by	 60.7064785877238
your father.--Pardon me.--It pains me to offend you. But amidst	 22.87278621816199
your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your	 30.437001752304027
displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you	 52.90818193663787
consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to	 46.98129012232833
avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally	 83.46259102883594
bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to	 28.0444021981084
the sense and disposition of both.--I will only say farther, that	 64.81825135913482
from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was	 54.79305414237041
confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me	 30.987666138602293
before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy	 42.369459542512566
connection.--He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,	 34.48057618692267
as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon	 47.65404731489727
returning.--The part which I acted, is now to be explained.--His	 39.39188125586638
sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our	 54.27380126893344
coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible	 37.36971289627059
that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly	 51.13201854310663
resolved on joining him directly in London.--We accordingly	 39.55723457707192
went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to	 41.32072527846074
my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.--I described, and	 29.47184468569696
enforced them earnestly.--But, however this remonstrance might have	 50.49523543922827
staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it	 14.693003721711083
would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been	 62.41913254255917
seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your	 31.63664251645752
sister's indifference. He had before believed her to return his	 47.10740978161136
affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.--But Bingley has	 93.38904201575413
great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment	 50.56133491389648
than on his own.--To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived	 54.096464425077215
himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him against	 76.43938352897659
returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,	 40.898819913905484
was scarcely the work of a moment.--I cannot blame myself for	 29.41774457593316
having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in the	 35.592412730916216
whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is	 28.699473947960783
that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to	 14.103110318868248
conceal from him your sister's being in town. I knew it myself, as	 40.34477306414261
it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant	 52.38271485909207
of it.--That they might have met without ill consequence, is	 87.70435407135696
perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough	 33.28446527885393
extinguished for him to see her without some danger.--Perhaps this	 31.632237822574115
concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.--It is done, however,	 38.228451595890455
and it was done for the best.--On this subject I have nothing more	 40.086876429345025
to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's	 28.64403708317709
feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which	 41.03246801182158
governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have	 36.05886380946145
not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more	 45.61808640571107
weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only	 40.74883969636243
refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my	 48.545642931746094
family. Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but	 36.07654860409607
of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one	 27.811633551996856
witness of undoubted veracity. Mr. Wickham is the son of a very	 19.690073191487656
respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the	 34.61195997944298
Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his	 18.51154280828614
trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on	 65.80610385879449
George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore	 65.36091894846645
liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and	 42.054461311617075
afterwards at Cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own	 56.16477389110997
father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have	 26.307403536983934
been unable to give him a gentleman's education. My father was not	 31.604124914883336
only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always	 56.778181070762216
engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the	 24.402434254983177
church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.	 34.97142461668095
As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think	 28.96289319891043
of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities--the	 16.360278897479844
want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge	 30.379996249422547
of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man	 17.938052503749727
of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of	 48.02225979115112
seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have.	 31.026944746696675
Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell.	 37.55692552866756
But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a	 26.48688619850343
suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his	 36.65030173711374
real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father	 57.40528460534417
died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to	 17.618175952618717
the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it	 76.05235056485516
to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his	 24.431821198959472
profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a	 67.06877041490671
valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became	 31.83277118263845
vacant. There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own	 29.540857618795787
father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these	 34.59962615857655
events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally	 44.3326938691563
resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it	 43.755592150597714
unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary	 46.79841250041007
advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be	 21.768910172060174
benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law,	 48.78095864796376
and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would	 23.704999693728062
be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than	 24.46987423261762
believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to	 39.93555126357179
accede to his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a	 23.3759874335251
clergyman. The business was therefore soon settled. He resigned all	 118.85089697061308
claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could	 34.74734755704626
ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three	 62.72285960167402
thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I	 41.561654684360775
thought too ill of him, to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his	 35.61825069522646
society in town. In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his	 61.89386823246055
studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all	 32.040664017648844
restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For	 35.12677331309074
about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the	 32.25839672889523
incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied	 18.75654378334349
to me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he	 101.96270925169202
assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were	 31.155551790877833
exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,	 47.1111409592673
and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would	 32.15439778641813
present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there	 36.63596527488533
could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other	 29.51537636625841
person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered	 21.92510683895202
father's intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to	 24.04129279317899
comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.	 35.550340551459065
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his	 25.100690390679205
circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me	 34.8265578644283
to others, as in his reproaches to myself. After this period, every	 45.36617736342755
appearance of acquaintance was dropt. How he lived I know not. But	 60.980808606349804
last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice. I	 31.16237818162344
must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget	 41.13287848055831
myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce	 65.96593158067694
me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no	 47.74983363736612
doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my	 40.847136407616894
junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel	 13.262479962347982
Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she was taken from	 69.75571478314644
school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last	 34.31128485210887
summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate;	 46.21058955037697
and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there	 98.40216086358133
proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs.	 23.162735881811702
Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by	 23.06506524912283
her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,	 39.1744356655532
whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his	 34.72036160803179
kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe	 37.880222534229944
herself in love, and to consent to an elopement. She was then but	 37.92027712457262
fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her	 30.245880872143275
imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to	 30.41938424713987
herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the	 39.587320241320434
intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea	 46.565907465536505
of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as	 53.27899216749446
a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt	 46.38158699433292
and how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings	 51.50790142560907
prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left	 52.192305591869335
the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from	 46.24378848175009
her charge. Mr. Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my	 36.6488202314334
sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot	 27.948024298265477
help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a	 50.93020739430973
strong inducement. His revenge would have been complete indeed.	 29.278579198390066
This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we	 22.202627595019234
have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject	 18.2295469957046
it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty	 54.19571256109819
towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of	 46.78765110789821
falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to	 36.733947291359094
be wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of every thing	 49.521161376858416
concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and	 32.89519198721909
suspicion certainly not in your inclination. You may possibly	 37.77144854546718
wonder why all this was not told you last night. But I was not then	 36.854243481310256
master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.	 49.04806885222087
For the truth of every thing here related, I can appeal more	 25.229426418079658
particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our	 35.73161661238071
near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of	 27.870576027112083
the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted	 42.57545890014836
with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of	 48.43939634159869
_me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented	 37.79812481819438
by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may	 45.118845987485415
be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find	 30.78359131252877
some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course	 33.516459634521034
of the morning. I will only add, God bless you.	 29.59713998768131
"FITZWILLIAM DARCY."	 414.9209889585663
CHAPTER XIII.	 12.911953956184709
If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to	 37.87135311835586
contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of	 21.385618444179677
its contents. But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly	 38.223447495310936
she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.	 45.5669864567276
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did	 48.82577909347207
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;	 41.968875057988505
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to	 19.002547773602146
give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong	 76.35702796775048
prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of	 51.01359012748875
what had happened at Netherfield. She read, with an eagerness which	 18.035090698433475
hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing	 54.75755925429376
what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the	 44.826423278115605
sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister's	 49.71634095172372
insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of	 23.145080833737715
the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have	 40.86826265038327
any wish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had	 39.596444755858116
done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It	 71.97832211556742
was all pride and insolence.	 37.913155794084744
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham, when	 21.727422425882146
she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which,	 36.99490512365097
if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which	 107.85442012243969
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings	 33.16719263832642
were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.	 32.778578206860985
Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished	 62.090968957906654
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false!	 26.915278108221816
This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!"--and when she had	 27.115219827165866
gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the	 14.751436532784599
last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not	 38.82235121061387
regard it, that she would never look in it again.	 41.340143071024514
In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on	 49.82075214684306
nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter	 41.41846344136603
was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she	 17.990119659330627
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and	 35.8425169481134
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.	 15.203159536533317
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family, was exactly	 36.91595802265255
what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy,	 17.551919973638512
though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his	 19.093663482880682
own words. So far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to	 41.11224601041366
the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living	 137.59952724193707
was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was	 34.05134763851383
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the	 26.94028611363371
other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did	 32.38849630728391
not err. But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the	 26.48948423298983
particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions	 97.82548902062605
to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three	 44.36173546359211
thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the	 44.48576522960563
letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be	 45.56078676971292
impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with	 33.2795198941407
little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on.	 48.73555644197483
But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had	 48.00880892786419
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to	 48.14677856959208
render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a	 29.84861858198026
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.	 30.959047434159523
The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to	 20.791950802010227
Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could	 54.88850777161987
bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his	 27.02077886252614
entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the	 32.282515634371336
persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,	 37.11086292458553
had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life,	 54.54553261000594
nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to	 36.088499226924874
his real character, had information been in her power, she had never	 27.138335750217184
felt a wish of enquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner, had	 56.130594525871714
established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to	 29.39844061261977
recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of	 46.31219540243999
integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr.	 17.01074780485013
Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those	 70.46747681854035
casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr. Darcy	 27.112449557520534
had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance. But no	 35.95630313730931
such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before	 53.87297348822818
her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more	 37.94065195809103
substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and	 38.61412860819743
the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After	 28.8462377682196
pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to	 40.14215715153598
read. But, alas! the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy,	 53.787329988357975
received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel	 31.099060545606758
Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was	 56.284272540604526
referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam	 28.817127664815033
himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his	 20.843299480865262
near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no	 24.44757540255931
reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to	 36.05847013267373
him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and	 16.833075270135698
at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never	 16.658757365385608
have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his	 22.37025534308674
cousin's corroboration.	 121.34288640875192
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation	 52.38546968061466
between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Philips's.	 39.89859549000836
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_	 28.02277586684564
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and	 26.67799605158036
wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting	 42.43517457120163
himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions	 15.553478957426728
with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear	 37.42017032988815
of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that	 48.54660206646304
_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball	 43.295212661455075
the very next week. She remembered also, that till the Netherfield	 52.751979339650774
family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but	 42.71123486471285
herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where	 75.16102153593188
discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr.	 31.41045514855233
Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the	 30.472952430264204
father, would always prevent his exposing the son.	 52.04713360222243
How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned!	 34.5145145398293
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and	 28.11848978199796
hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer	 21.551789759859503
the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing.	 26.404266266378468
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had	 30.41822350971071
either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying	 80.37720908471886
his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most	 55.72152568260307
incautiously shewn. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter	 25.819743525134815
and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not	 17.123225570053123
but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago	 35.00777149498903
asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as	 24.55807206832529
were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their	 27.068334407359554
acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much	 60.78210152303636
together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing	 35.78506643874307
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him	 38.797749927045444
of irreligious or immoral habits. That among his own connections he was	 19.99923422204679
esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a	 50.037982924593734
brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of	 30.7846690364431
his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling. That had	 25.302934543407453
his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of	 38.72701627415661
every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and	 27.30827082778447
that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man	 34.795648217208566
as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.	 29.109428915749323
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself.--Of neither Darcy nor Wickham	 52.06597683680872
could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,	 16.22882783247684
prejudiced, absurd.	 10.85925182058365
"How despicably have I acted!" she cried.--"I, who have prided myself on	 40.55997915864622
my discernment!--I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have	 29.354920698293913
often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my	 40.35377668865594
vanity, in useless or blameable distrust.--How humiliating is this	 51.179920001573066
discovery!--Yet, how just a humiliation!--Had I been in love, I could	 45.46502022551725
not have been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my	 36.36236964904972
folly.--Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect	 52.372549663302145
of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted	 28.149352352896045
prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were	 81.75849902375461
concerned. Till this moment, I never knew myself."	 59.942477189167064
From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line	 57.672843246729705
which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation	 60.296526143750185
_there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. Widely	 39.58458899445262
different was the effect of a second perusal.--How could she deny that	 32.267332847812185
credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to	 17.910847257563077
give in the other?--He declared himself to have been totally	 41.58508456693206
unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help	 11.308934621847746
remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been.--Neither could she	 59.16121299661967
deny the justice of his description of Jane.--She felt that Jane's	 61.42264323906937
feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a	 33.727476703764864
constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great	 31.7644479281466
sensibility.	 5545.038753112048
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were	 25.801099967295475
mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense	 66.14141701544328
of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly	 44.42855386167182
for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as	 44.67835602307405
having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first	 33.32638883497106
disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind	 31.635338625928007
than on hers.	 74.37260059498585
The compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt. It soothed,	 22.751150541059886
but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus	 25.090508763769964
self-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that	 14.461384888115823
Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest	 38.39205860653632
relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt	 41.97355125046159
by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she	 51.77644074540219
had ever known before.	 38.066345540386536
After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every	 50.17630735331331
variety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities,	 103.63681839896606
and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and	 26.679556693278023
so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her	 32.933804459847615
at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of	 27.722018494027097
appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such	 46.35471099603395
reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.	 83.02873830267427
She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each	 37.46859789125344
called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes to take	 37.91832834803166
leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least	 22.875995090785047
an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her	 35.21430801523276
till she could be found.--Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in	 69.955189814056
missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no	 25.267124681819237
longer an object. She could think only of her letter.	 86.9113461562471
CHAPTER XIV.	 12.911953956184709
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr. Collins having	 15.169441585473104
been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was	 33.25336364049778
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very	 42.265563506954734
good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the	 41.057283429899684
melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then	 39.64743283242178
hastened to console Lady Catherine, and her daughter; and on his return,	 23.280213983188556
brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship,	 37.74964833687815
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of	 14.60133361067921
having them all to dine with her.	 69.08521686995287
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting, that had	 30.50840078406357
she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her	 35.407367474806826
future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her	 39.53029520926366
ladyship's indignation would have been. "What would she have said?--how	 41.493529886907844
would she have behaved?" were questions with which she amused herself.	 69.49397349182259
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.--"I assure	 35.43428729978095
you, I feel it exceedingly," said Lady Catherine; "I believe nobody	 41.938829081953386
feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly	 23.237950957640123
attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to	 34.350032410763625
me!--They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear	 82.05914094168423
colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy	 134.73784866522251
seemed to feel it most acutely, more I think than last year. His	 56.02653204641411
attachment to Rosings, certainly increases."	 165.36026301114705
Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which	 56.675304431320804
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.	 56.0818862851548
Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of	 35.554926039789315
spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that	 47.98055056491347
she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,	 33.067897319940116
"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you	 26.997973176682443
may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your	 27.444230853533462
company, I am sure."	 44.72355112473576
"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied	 26.8988676064181
Elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it.--I must be in town	 23.341278307381234
next Saturday."	 191.73213617155807
"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected	 31.82059763447093
you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There	 78.52063545993867
can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly	 49.14811550895874
spare you for another fortnight."	 40.93078614462795
"But my father cannot.--He wrote last week to hurry my return."	 58.19736821170809
"Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.--Daughters	 47.33737647460743
are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay	 43.67429552377716
another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as	 14.015604635063973
far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as	 42.014256982238905
Dawson does not object to the Barouche box, there will be very good room	 22.625217110132645
for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I	 25.470473230255134
should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large."	 43.010899958516276
"You are all kindness, Madam; but I believe we must abide by our	 26.112707258771152
original plan."	 95.70665923349553
Lady Catherine seemed resigned.	 15.993156207114211
"Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant with them. You know I always	 28.341418310076712
speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling	 25.90238909126576
post by themselves. It is highly improper. You must contrive to send	 24.822443159589547
somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of	 47.306522147115295
thing.--Young women should always be properly guarded and attended,	 55.26035853748621
according to their situation in life. When my niece Georgiana went to	 41.13007213256533
Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men servants go	 46.41513757135468
with her.--Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady	 74.19229210200025
Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.--I	 28.017976048881795
am excessively attentive to all those things. You must send John with	 26.237134674676973
the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention	 34.402758453595744
it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone."	 50.96776592026351
"My uncle is to send a servant for us."	 40.27100154796673
"Oh!--Your uncle!--He keeps a man-servant, does he?--I am very glad you	 30.17383062170467
have somebody who thinks of those things. Where shall you change	 106.09185672597958
horses?--Oh! Bromley, of course.--If you mention my name at the Bell,	 28.429149062702514
you will be attended to."	 20.356617642789505
Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,	 40.98624635878676
and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,	 60.21784819921403
which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so	 48.49676914488453
occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be	 40.06885073305297
reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it	 36.92532054597037
as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk,	 41.98210366500067
in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant	 42.4652581579677
recollections.	 7299.820831799248
Mr. Darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She	 42.16466671924425
studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at	 27.678356159200597
times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,	 85.13805946092373
she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly	 28.66080700750368
she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against	 42.380948335721634
herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.	 53.70900932985299
His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she	 70.93318319640302
could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or	 39.876061837458906
feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past	 45.63503107789527
behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in	 23.621450004975895
the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin.	 25.751941996725396
They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at	 28.497297382078894
them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his	 30.65641203938336
youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right	 38.20212762987402
herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently	 54.81660573567637
united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine	 43.23984307099616
and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,	 27.230218585282145
what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,	 53.3644145817945
irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always	 24.457885546236874
affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would	 27.53353457583357
scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While	 52.56681420482629
there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while	 26.27634310702636
Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for	 71.82145094808767
ever.	 753.6941685825765
Anxiety on Jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and Mr.	 62.13592741866639
Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good	 78.42756959266312
opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was	 59.64410561589969
proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame,	 38.87192629898896
unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his	 36.9600535548639
friend. How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so	 133.62540657903332
desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for	 53.942285443615106
happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own	 19.70626306397296
family!	 684.3556222513033
When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's	 57.88031849705351
character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had	 31.51894193837125
seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it	 44.183538659895945
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.	 36.74973715335021
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of	 27.47067433311445
her stay, as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent	 25.547952486726217
there; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of	 46.07730770285501
their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,	 21.20111536917908
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right	 27.844231029696918
way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the	 40.791142716464975
work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.	 23.180698838486386
When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them	 52.90469726751961
a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;	 27.44125160613298
and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her	 15.902447527536259
hand to both.	 277.8075294287333
CHAPTER XV.	 12.911953956184709
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few	 47.17614174853767
minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of	 35.48090835072828
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.	 30.162234659587288
"I know not, Miss Elizabeth," said he, "whether Mrs. Collins has yet	 42.18358043404941
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am very	 34.11846884598504
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for	 42.19205434128606
it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We know	 54.59534602573099
how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode. Our plain	 33.5010320140591
manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we	 72.1132861408438
see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like	 36.7361035824466
yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,	 38.73522109925531
and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending	 16.98082519651975
your time unpleasantly."	 68.59175336345776
Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had	 29.076280697164798
spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with	 24.316271214723233
Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_	 41.259611128519424
feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling	 39.021069464674255
solemnity replied,	 316.6941467474907
"It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your	 35.02905155374191
time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most	 73.17515822726017
fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior	 44.65132931691077
society, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of	 49.933331218494764
varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that	 23.599468649655698
your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation	 70.48217037155024
with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of	 50.47491599137307
extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on	 73.97701690712454
what a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there. In	 27.767420710346848
truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble	 42.09616386232431
parsonage, I should not think any one abiding in it an object of	 32.344262690377334
compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings."	 30.97316268836388
Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was	 27.579769203135303
obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility	 44.18364874457288
and truth in a few short sentences.	 38.922516847992966
"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into	 34.374018595034
Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will	 16.342489045056904
be able to do so. Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs. Collins you	 35.92105776167111
have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear	 27.025570993020438
that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be	 15.042315434002111
as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,	 31.77126067906934
that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in	 47.454584033619106
marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of	 56.261275478422675
thinking. There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of	 21.455471032052735
character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each	 57.028116286517374
other."	 615.6520139177117
Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was	 41.51100087790655
the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed	 46.533626116652606
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to	 21.99937691880412
have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from	 19.642365510407107
whom they sprung. Poor Charlotte!--it was melancholy to leave her to	 65.74864556112648
such society!--But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though	 32.23733753243804
evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to	 24.8490312830264
ask for compassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her	 68.26108073456429
poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their	 23.730888814641006
charms.	 8.776652323334677
At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels	 25.004573244018516
placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate	 41.29427834114767
parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by	 64.45111811780701
Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning	 15.218269747718368
her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks	 42.75380423190136
for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his	 32.5484920302579
compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her	 31.308625696707892
in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when	 38.08419524559772
he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had	 20.48566198971099
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.	 43.36219301159636
"But," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects	 64.16627487569059
delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you	 32.95680451126983
while you have been here."	 22.414183728827673
Elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and	 32.29349830650472
the carriage drove off.	 20.61371863239265
"Good gracious!" cried Maria, after a few minutes silence, "it seems but	 26.498350089323928
a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have	 21.06310914347045
happened!"	 4341.853616373967
"A great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh.	 40.15504714267526
"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there	 91.80254854358348
twice!--How much I shall have to tell!"	 51.44732316773599
Elizabeth privately added, "And how much I shall have to conceal."	 63.945317814565655
Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and	 38.450035556661604
within four hours of their leaving Hunsford, they reached Mr. Gardiner's	 103.84289739468856
house, where they were to remain a few days.	 31.794765139617283
Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her	 30.496169371768723
spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt	 52.29387684665012
had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at	 24.067586543576592
Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.	 41.549603957516375
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for	 20.425325289221487
Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy's proposals. To know	 40.8348060700349
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish	 30.459765928526565
Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own	 23.111204483392928
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation	 24.04579932994122
to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision	 38.7936758212676
in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate;	 38.24460406209941
and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into	 28.85862559994882
repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister	 59.60969950620405
farther.	 4694.658810476984
CHAPTER XVI.	 12.911953956184709
It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out	 33.546630556523006
together from Gracechurch-street, for the town of ---- in Hertfordshire;	 62.822876393632534
and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage was	 19.30648695182925
to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's	 25.04388223453068
punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up	 34.80648632003168
stairs. These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily	 37.40406054532767
employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on	 29.39819035555016
guard, and dressing a sallad and cucumber.	 29.603660781470396
After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set	 99.97787796361047
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,	 33.43011600515847
"Is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?"	 28.05322379100372
"And we mean to treat you all," added Lydia; "but you must lend us the	 38.657133303218025
money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there." Then shewing	 51.846521798159976
her purchases: "Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think it	 33.141970099706626
is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall	 40.22872225990795
pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any	 30.044442045207486
better."	 1267.8220897025642
And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect	 52.225689328515166
unconcern, "Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and	 31.138528385160765
when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I	 24.680062772411674
think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what	 22.437626502163535
one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they	 64.76354171218438
are going in a fortnight."	 50.45297184121696
"Are they indeed?" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.	 26.168980924022996
"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to	 37.68888812599998
take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme,	 40.96558561926429
and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all. Mamma would like to	 21.66527232778121
go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall	 72.70442567157451
have!"	 309.8241250305318
"Yes," thought Elizabeth, "_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed,	 44.354187968104924
and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole	 66.95961188045541
campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor	 32.038208727776265
regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton."	 34.30396131319046
"Now I have got some news for you," said Lydia, as they sat down to	 22.206593001413296
table. "What do you think? It is excellent news, capital news, and about	 66.88990887178011
a certain person that we all like."	 120.75794564960471
Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he	 23.13152607154385
need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said,	 103.04644910148403
"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the	 38.63109855311609
waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse	 48.020534113564224
things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad	 30.581508767861585
he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for	 29.939856756035343
my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?	 51.78606154828322
There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King. There's for you! She	 22.802729401591296
is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay. Wickham is safe."	 90.84475288777845
"And Mary King is safe!" added Elizabeth; "safe from a connection	 45.022292676580896
imprudent as to fortune."	 104.68706102494576
"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him."	 31.509518792854436
"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said Jane.	 15.94027635990019
"I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it he never cared	 41.086224968339636
three straws about her. Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled	 91.11635528029198
thing?"	 592.668952955733
Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such	 16.4425693886434
coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_	 19.011136656263663
was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied	 48.00882976031107
liberal!	 8.776652323334677
As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was	 17.212812877843835
ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their	 30.57402894591165
boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and	 8.780639944275535
Lydia's purchases, were seated in it.	 64.78914808427292
"How nicely we are crammed in!" cried Lydia. "I am glad I bought my	 32.330597490979464
bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now	 42.901602843291755
let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way	 38.44378162428501
home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all,	 17.1582779820167
since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any	 40.18688156197451
flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband	 42.00678044075776
before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.	 40.027267418301605
She is almost three and twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not	 36.13001708189284
being married before three and twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to	 19.670083496274817
get husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.	 115.05757577176998
Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!	 27.721428805679416
how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would	 21.541938088194975
chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece	 64.44533923773105
of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's. Kitty and me were to spend	 77.46196032534557
the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the	 27.276305462165954
evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so	 69.22937140558122
she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen	 47.29342111774459
was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We	 46.00125174542131
dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for a	 45.15540461888162
lady,--only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Col. and Mrs.	 54.20001001126765
Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow	 40.49605627808425
one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,	 40.61658139448202
and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they	 42.68631773921367
did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.	 46.53986536440303
Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect	 76.26704486705327
something, and then they soon found out what was the matter."	 32.936599622623234
With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia,	 44.09244589160044
assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her	 17.521762343714954
companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she	 40.61247354141328
could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.	 38.249188353760324
Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane	 47.19015356713392
in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet	 28.288354061642185
say voluntarily to Elizabeth,	 161.89527117155527
"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy."	 13.133215169391864
Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases	 49.274000600397464
came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects	 68.88700996953395
which occupied them; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table,	 38.29359375150097
after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was	 16.42088909580516
doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present	 47.22297292991311
fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,	 37.52483338025064
retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice	 39.3996022465607
rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various	 32.34634284572743
pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her.	 33.042410698662295
"Oh! Mary," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!	 40.98433494969203
as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended	 24.86544025573025
there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if	 37.815496318341246
Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we	 28.568588453457764
behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest	 42.224459218389406
cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have	 33.89825038425674
treated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought	 36.637620883899785
we never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter.	 28.310923904685886
And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so	 44.764494012874295
loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!"	 32.86669163041565
To this, Mary very gravely replied, "Far be it from me, my dear sister,	 72.43447804201503
to depreciate such pleasures. They would doubtless be congenial with	 40.25439410960304
the generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms	 20.13807109234989
for _me_. I should infinitely prefer a book."	 42.56504529958095
But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to any	 30.645010031769115
body for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.	 35.270284324283104
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to	 23.27011732978205
Meryton and see how every body went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed	 40.04587527037973
the scheme. It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at	 31.61535293098447
home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was	 21.79660390265442
another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Wickham again,	 127.28610500844466
and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to _her_,	 31.905999516324133
of the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression. In	 37.847018223071906
a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be	 26.809060750906635
nothing more to plague her on his account.	 30.61431634030508
She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton	 38.95520561869999
scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under	 62.87804353054146
frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her	 66.14237967664472
father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were	 18.175942366366876
at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often	 19.16316368721808
disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.	 23.0704613232905
CHAPTER XVII.	 12.911953956184709
Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no	 41.13544257945563
longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular	 32.526137788413415
in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,	 29.12393142404464
she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr.	 23.65642334957621
Darcy and herself.	 173.2825975409824
Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly	 31.345199718052474
partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly	 140.07432211991173
natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was	 48.24427042975145
sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so	 37.65992987976101
little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the	 36.11115205754448
unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.	 16.1446581432415
"His being so sure of succeeding, was wrong," said she; "and certainly	 76.12282863148829
ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his	 45.0989372857641
disappointment."	 2413.500757385625
"Indeed," replied Elizabeth, "I am heartily sorry for him; but he has	 21.549601251119835
other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.	 34.73778911968176
You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"	 19.23348723904953
"Blame you! Oh, no."	 155.29273890458398
"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham."	 35.326714080757526
"No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."	 30.431765180215294
"But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very	 29.85486128947406
next day."	 78.86624304468843
She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far	 23.967044769970396
as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane!	 68.569570212508
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that	 25.590884414523035
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here	 35.69197556837496
collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy's vindication, though	 50.64673728021866
grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.	 26.21056781256602
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and	 41.94069377550281
seek to clear one, without involving the other.	 116.32678664231449
"This will not do," said Elizabeth. "You never will be able to make both	 47.116921322763105
of them good for any thing. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied	 49.69550762749902
with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just	 38.70329939774858
enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting	 32.1198336162794
about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr.	 31.505840011266333
Darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse."	 76.74114310908116
It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.	 30.219362744510736
"I do not know when I have been more shocked," said she. "Wickham so	 18.42206732882739
very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! dear Lizzy, only	 46.08653529026951
consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the	 34.45626332287578
knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a thing of	 76.51787877722569
his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it	 15.922192677669068
so."	 393.1306865139221
"Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so	 38.0480221272528
full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am	 30.771532907676214
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion	 61.72019877007507
makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will	 43.434300843527325
be as light as a feather."	 34.886549828412036
"Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his	 23.8453503506067
countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner."	 33.0609309013226
"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those	 30.95038168716218
two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the	 50.62152354442434
appearance of it."	 48.202430099097796
"I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you	 26.158610313510994
used to do."	 58.44294639171585
"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike	 47.13562232284563
to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one's genius, such an	 28.558558642770887
opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually	 44.39179082533556
abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing	 23.833531589428
at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty."	 90.67368980509899
"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat	 32.76639841721623
the matter as you do now."	 62.741438025652286
"Indeed I could not. I was uncomfortable enough. I was very	 40.30651534942413
uncomfortable, I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to, of what I	 79.8924242575968
felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and	 43.98733547215348
vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!"	 74.89334408198307
"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions	 24.747500366913677
in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly	 63.84083420382185
undeserved."	 8.776652323334677
"Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most	 43.49359065952204
natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is	 25.972630716794814
one point, on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I	 43.64562674769753
ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand	 55.6652774503464
Wickham's character."	 118.86456192484785
Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied, "Surely there can be no	 39.31914548374218
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your own opinion?"	 32.468935065762714
"That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me to	 15.07397403023566
make his communication public. On the contrary every particular relative	 27.71099146129903
to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and	 20.588404623598233
if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who	 27.212530987872125
will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent,	 30.803273211883944
that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton, to	 37.91541153988901
attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal to it. Wickham	 31.512121914300344
will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here,	 47.010837095053176
what he really is. Sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we	 39.631830603219
may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At present I will	 46.56649570771566
say nothing about it."	 73.2823655956212
"You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for	 33.59281897001667
ever. He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to	 35.58962935268372
re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate."	 15.952718423139341
The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation. She had	 14.461414994875808
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,	 45.77204500075338
and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish	 45.91658045791072
to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind,	 61.25552704962932
of which prudence forbad the disclosure. She dared not relate the other	 22.870606996631622
half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she	 26.01529577463331
had been valued by his friend. Here was knowledge in which no one could	 34.179390233039335
partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect	 17.954348994095017
understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this	 44.369593044838616
last incumbrance of mystery. "And then," said she, "if that very	 43.87096599722426
improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell	 73.97009349702849
what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The	 113.58245227930678
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"	 33.054409018668196
She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real	 35.9453329205521
state of her sister's spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a	 27.772340564347882
very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself in	 28.816285641021096
love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from	 77.73257769730316
her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often	 83.86277932675569
boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to	 39.07082139622857
every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the	 38.96729941034783
feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those	 16.72754057806709
regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their	 21.952772824220073
tranquillity.	 2349.196044979379
"Well, Lizzy," said Mrs. Bennet one day, "what is your opinion _now_ of	 37.1067380927167
this sad business of Jane's? For my part, I am determined never to speak	 72.95609858719997
of it again to anybody. I told my sister Philips so the other day. But I	 56.65083672639673
cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London. Well, he is a	 26.894490800039936
very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there is the least	 32.54749488203473
chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his	 28.36106070982016
coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of every	 36.48762125901447
body too, who is likely to know."	 62.44996333914303
"I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more."	 24.053121922858832
"Oh, well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I	 34.1055460499089
shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was	 41.629472076712894
her, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure	 34.67610137068016
Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he	 35.982987911339464
has done."	 179.91014563494755
But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,	 37.25447428173766
she made no answer.	 11.498228960041823
"Well, Lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the	 45.64111112507111
Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it	 61.73503152806519
will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an	 62.965146373464826
excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother,	 38.87874244467284
she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_	 33.188434490501216
housekeeping, I dare say."	 13.672147167801292
"No, nothing at all."	 65.17077699648391
"A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. _They_ will	 24.594503221313428
take care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed	 30.88091026808903
for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often	 123.39260738659462
talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it	 70.39176892104277
quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens."	 47.184168133623324
"It was a subject which they could not mention before me."	 32.7448114425868
"No. It would have been strange if they had. But I make no doubt, they	 52.80342409142713
often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an	 52.3863689517122
estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. _I_ should be	 33.06712714129445
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me."	 68.68321296462491
CHAPTER XVIII.	 12.911953956184709
The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was	 34.92467638885236
the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in	 22.453900978323226
the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost	 35.241932584649014
universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,	 28.230060707567088
and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very	 28.599071330186476
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and	 45.25909763594768
Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such	 38.56754685338433
hard-heartedness in any of the family.	 20.535757753227628
"Good Heaven! What is to become of us! What are we to do!" would they	 114.7139841024485
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. "How can you be smiling so,	 24.695671053748697
Lizzy?"	 2519.8484213095435
Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what	 39.57245578744974
she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years	 41.4624447988185
ago.	 12350.95689839086
"I am sure," said she, "I cried for two days together when Colonel	 43.61410674001894
Millar's regiment went away. I thought I should have broke my heart."	 33.73471189660595
"I am sure I shall break _mine_," said Lydia.	 11.728827274407433
"If one could but go to Brighton!" observed Mrs. Bennet.	 45.25999032904815
"Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so	 41.988512101818635
disagreeable."	 1974.0752064033145
"A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever."	 74.142952324541
"And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,"	 20.088995347791112
added Kitty.	 362.51100927854156
Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through	 49.73693587786697
Longbourn-house. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense	 36.171836536772545
of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's	 45.692890175604
objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his	 54.19124546192386
interference in the views of his friend.	 34.01403336865792
But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she	 40.57564737373705
received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the Colonel of the	 50.870529775546835
regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a	 52.496032424396525
very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour	 30.54030159615523
and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of	 41.73134396574511
their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.	 41.86122250881539
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,	 33.40656992965736
the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely	 30.371068335086324
to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia flew	 32.1913193488814
about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's	 50.36962433474412
congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;	 54.723181447393245
whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate	 25.93049628172396
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.	 31.152352373205687
"I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,"	 39.279063292158355
said she, "though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much	 42.4204840675844
right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older."	 66.3127913346259
In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make	 16.02595573850333
her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from	 33.64562343425102
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she	 40.18499749243841
considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense	 36.7263156043783
for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it	 52.525254257593105
known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her	 30.875549482870188
go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general	 37.94225899177496
behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of	 62.24281531210167
such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more	 18.702468809256366
imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must	 28.28357963492397
be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said,	 38.84503505776084
"Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public	 41.59499609545867
place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little	 41.242815476558405
expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present	 27.051202030500882
circumstances."	 2144.6415957653116
"If you were aware," said Elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to	 28.03494969474776
us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and	 29.35768274328746
imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you	 36.30834861774388
would judge differently in the affair."	 33.12749811318703
"Already arisen!" repeated Mr. Bennet. "What, has she frightened away	 75.13384612919286
some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such	 58.935866466589374
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity,	 17.84355375312972
are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows	 28.730735581844314
who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly."	 33.786467410940965
"Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not	 16.640500133261245
of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our	 40.86558252108127
importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the	 20.64034971804008
wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark	 44.23948075923466
Lydia's character. Excuse me--for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear	 51.24639827812203
father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and	 27.947748224420405
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of	 38.1456293656809
her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character	 27.465049991225772
will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt	 69.66561955562587
that ever made herself and her family ridiculous. A flirt too, in the	 39.842385117541475
worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond	 43.25311492939771
youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of	 32.775473780100526
her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal	 30.00470005171996
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty	 61.232820189393294
is also comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,	 52.13737498180936
ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled! Oh! my dear father, can you	 32.053004211257154
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever	 43.32346233731033
they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the	 32.481750245496364
disgrace?"	 2280.1500456332105
Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and	 37.753026582512355
affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,	 67.25429871012447
"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known,	 16.06377720529834
you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less	 23.149073010945127
advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three very silly	 56.79360180316419
sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to	 23.842916552011715
Brighton. Let her go then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will	 60.582049785753995
keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an	 44.59380144511706
object of prey to any body. At Brighton she will be of less importance	 46.83051550529539
even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find	 59.21172729681643
women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being	 84.27000237417992
there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow	 49.908974000132446
many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest	 45.88823797431524
of her life."	 29.848743019519155
With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion	 28.550638937216323
continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not	 43.017373860284295
in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them.	 33.59389788979733
She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over	 30.342808527623657
unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her	 45.547862108346095
disposition.	 3344.63975230009
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her	 32.72699522854147
father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their	 53.914479444986625
united volubility. In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised	 54.63774078076237
every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw with the creative eye of	 23.409309080456385
fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers. She	 48.14399936090277
saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at	 39.5340654580445
present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp; its tents	 22.719771395533336
stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young	 25.542952138526733
and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she	 38.16494295479224
saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six	 44.63740750679729
officers at once.	 126.20681460705063
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and	 23.498163786473494
such realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could	 36.08182506961965
have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the	 24.303981097925973
same. Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the	 57.54207165468507
melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there	 22.190247490146337
himself.	 543.2586490566042
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures	 20.778593586682085
continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving	 38.347317149737265
home.	 1867.6590611343386
Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been	 30.257781306781837
frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty	 71.97209326718914
well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even	 59.20770104664929
learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,	 40.67414168675088
an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present	 26.6089444962628
behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,	 20.802549999626045
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which	 44.043395069064005
had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after	 58.713405321672624
what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in	 28.302721344326972
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous	 31.625492724872387
gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the	 26.973106843001833
reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever	 61.718518134625036
cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified	 47.74359885587099
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.	 61.86334282533708
On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton, he dined	 23.60578712000681
with others of the officers at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth	 53.70639974094428
disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some	 57.618655389561965
enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she	 58.297395114858965
mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three	 59.373278685454
weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.	 43.781204641984736
He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's	 55.262752630668075
recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen	 41.18669891833993
him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man,	 18.43166228085827
asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.	 36.56460202829711
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added, "How long did you	 27.580640123376725
say that he was at Rosings?"	 26.86040585348657
"Nearly three weeks."	 314.7051280051521
"And you saw him frequently?"	 53.63553320871715
"Yes, almost every day."	 27.241124978638684
"His manners are very different from his cousin's."	 39.76157943516828
"Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance."	 38.46340729171362
"Indeed!" cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her. "And pray	 28.716852237875976
may I ask?" but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, "Is it in	 40.19845116789209
address that he improves? Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his	 74.12370702203432
ordinary style? for I dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more	 50.26849363958357
serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials."	 24.601679016550683
"Oh, no!" said Elizabeth. "In essentials, I believe, he is very much	 29.28246686232384
what he ever was."	 99.50169464601007
While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to	 83.11862945038739
rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a	 30.099250504374528
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive	 28.102445883546235
and anxious attention, while she added,	 55.18709382068593
"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that	 38.762543200750706
either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from	 75.68623495825373
knowing him better, his disposition was better understood."	 114.85787120030122
Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated	 30.18059448799311
look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his	 27.119081358632158
embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of	 33.48757274839088
accents,	 8.776652323334677
"You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily	 33.192242792900885
comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume	 29.76566626221957
even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,	 56.98697660447636
may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter	 42.87594473496676
him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that	 29.02716666827136
the sort of cautiousness, to which you, I imagine, have been alluding,	 37.5917742949819
is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and	 38.861082828326886
judgment he stands much in awe. His fear of her, has always operated, I	 57.51546070337011
know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his	 28.77940615064397
wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he	 26.822885963561422
has very much at heart."	 166.14575635256165
Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a	 22.925009044219745
slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on	 52.727800249000154
the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge	 19.2662241639925
him. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,	 42.8122250138966
of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish	 22.313054100270982
Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a	 26.34324835380221
mutual desire of never meeting again.	 39.38381280788419
When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,	 53.43680196825219
from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation	 29.322480844257278
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the	 34.664809455749676
only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.	 45.77339272553152
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,	 23.356620397177025
and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the	 38.746074470120185
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there	 19.26163793808306
was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous	 58.662262405417906
happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus	 30.98972657306206
of her sisters were uttered without being heard.	 24.269904664618338
CHAPTER XIX.	 12.911953956184709
Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could	 30.575579724575118
not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic	 18.09531183704118
comfort. Her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance	 83.3295558037679
of good humour, which youth and beauty generally give, had married a	 54.171178203859846
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in	 89.38462069534638
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,	 43.71707789530679
esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of	 64.46921288076607
domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a	 42.726768554345696
disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own	 52.721728791209046
imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often	 72.74495378392955
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of	 34.75277608853325
the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal	 45.14042159314768
enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as	 34.13200859330175
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not	 46.78221175860878
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his	 41.064725033254135
wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true	 67.06115336560524
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.	 47.664424791341915
Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her	 17.88314701695705
father's behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but	 47.71722519101334
respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of	 32.65399365982357
herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to	 20.740575231914523
banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation	 21.885392877110995
and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own	 35.7939782212748
children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so	 42.52648305642717
strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so	 66.96728131854987
unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils	 29.542826225627806
arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly	 22.891539432370887
used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters,	 68.76013097292797
even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.	 33.591235976139785
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure, she found little	 54.18451559506693
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties	 36.82095273258396
abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and	 28.195251076952232
sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around	 18.342256588978554
them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty	 53.775251032506944
might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers	 82.37892460436146
of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition	 64.65066206709156
greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her	 23.38682608314904
folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering	 43.69938939071025
place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been	 60.93384483638768
sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward	 47.98807991285784
with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the	 40.390949610323844
satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to	 27.76318895460035
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have	 20.427657716497492
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by	 33.66265203460114
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the	 50.12707007577681
present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes	 71.18367421420764
was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation	 29.64008248873034
for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her	 19.616576642420796
mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in	 63.048106967045186
the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.	 29.607363769849808
"But it is fortunate," thought she, "that I have something to wish for.	 37.22224779517746
Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.	 46.09594080046066
But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my	 61.67984903286847
sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of	 44.92054181524721
pleasure realized. A scheme of which every part promises delight, can	 128.8521164157684
never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by	 53.52929877874689
the defence of some little peculiar vexation."	 32.10677372283735
When Lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely	 38.45538365066943
to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and	 28.503131365319934
always very short. Those to her mother, contained little else, than that	 73.39149523331534
they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers	 46.899425964979486
had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as	 29.54371768315054
made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which	 32.66436001691733
she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a	 24.799213676571767
violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going to the	 20.30435142624074
camp;--and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less	 24.50550401480727
to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much	 61.83970514848456
too full of lines under the words to be made public.	 63.360042002366264
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good	 35.37685517753652
humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at Longbourn. Everything wore	 33.72409170665244
a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came	 30.795482110339535
back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet	 59.44233406872837
was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June	 14.926134584277793
Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without	 25.614068853070396
tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by	 45.26370736641654
the following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to	 43.26448949811239
mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious	 31.47576459066969
arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in	 30.698015637867584
Meryton.	 1279.5472411991727
The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast	 28.48130126986867
approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter	 66.24028287152187
arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and	 63.47938181395446
curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from	 59.43032385430974
setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again	 41.739832251963925
within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so	 67.92600298314113
far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with	 54.3254444996144
the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up	 39.75353610765799
the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the	 18.280269047481593
present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. In that	 38.41069185216348
county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three	 29.55590037435085
weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The	 36.267977401719925
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where	 36.72280318083581
they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of	 34.60178521233503
her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,	 16.691974130107038
Dovedale, or the Peak.	 17.938414011134007
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing	 27.45003704620557
the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. But it	 38.36072565463341
was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;	 71.25186609086805
and all was soon right again.	 33.4219173828325
With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. It was	 32.183796191566785
impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its	 32.34919999519801
owner. "But surely," said she, "I may enter his county with impunity,	 28.220847341086117
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me."	 42.85183780420354
The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away	 31.771109684060555
before her uncle and aunt's arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and	 46.75067879765191
Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at	 52.104946170302725
Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two	 42.198440869540825
younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin	 49.93623274001327
Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and	 30.11190258649415
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every	 29.818907481609052
way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.	 27.79436280030792
The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next	 18.430387084845798
morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One	 46.88888463037926
enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a	 44.075326072313274
suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear	 42.65257453463939
inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection	 26.982186273391587
and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were	 37.267124667766865
disappointments abroad.	 10.85925182058365
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,	 26.34188551631599
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither	 71.9983168679606
lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth, Birmingham, &c. are	 16.801063394641606
sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present	 81.39806020134634
concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's	 51.23950653078942
former residence, and where she had lately learned that some	 48.54263282302585
acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen	 77.94654708639699
all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of	 16.759891468541586
Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated. It	 61.40391675430184
was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In	 25.194011644925638
talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an	 55.68420433349738
inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his	 46.32835688635732
willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.	 24.70743120733326
"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so	 42.843753405551126
much?" said her aunt. "A place too, with which so many of your	 90.63280810253995
acquaintance are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you	 250.7881509862013
know."	 1152.1181923999723
Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at	 23.551710447470633
Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She	 43.1932002989495
must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many,	 61.2449467558247
she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.	 34.72461057531124
Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. "If it were merely a fine house	 44.21337377312863
richly furnished," said she, "I should not care about it myself; but the	 17.560788711176027
grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the	 28.157039668865288
country."	 2014.0340064845823
Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce. The	 25.205752658917437
possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly	 61.63391615280372
occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and	 50.22522860127805
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run	 28.95794144171864
such a risk. But against this, there were objections; and she finally	 65.55174158007543
resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as	 49.211191005594266
to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered.	 27.61467424905275
Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid	 23.77709165809872
whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its	 51.64375276886024
proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for	 45.280595248904774
the summer. A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her	 52.01700587770045
alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of	 23.75011030969448
curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the	 34.1740980201408
next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and	 31.518587270091196
with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike	 22.42914586989385
to the scheme.	 58.84422053120421
To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.	 34.25492896317115

CHAPTER I.	 254.0372352719546
Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of	 12.69899890965739
Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned	 31.443006955952125
in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.	 53.87130710020665
The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They	 25.26207611516458
entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through	 32.52556486176615
a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent.	 42.85546388787944
Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired	 61.81313734313146
every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for	 42.80293799975982
half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable	 28.796687760493498
eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by	 22.703070573389002
Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which	 22.587919205280095
the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome, stone	 25.011546701421196
building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high	 42.05262546920781
woody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was	 27.063747681782427
swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks	 98.23168442040364
were neither formal, nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She	 45.72801223464879
had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural	 42.00590076985846
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were	 30.65051913698074
all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that	 26.365780061933542
to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!	 41.61945894972413
They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,	 21.429732009241953
while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of	 24.543539754424486
meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been	 79.35013472686036
mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the	 32.797355924396705
hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to	 46.47010196118504
wonder at her being where she was.	 30.35012263035095
The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less	 46.68374366303167
fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They	 30.84851144186288
followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well-proportioned	 28.247522117564227
room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went	 93.77192259672803
to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, from	 43.049539466634926
which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the	 32.3407226481176
distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was	 66.39865710043128
good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered	 38.52039423390931
on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace	 17.096420444646768
it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms, these objects were	 56.98655046392096
taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to	 62.691641890433516
be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable	 67.34983091007344
to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration	 33.06786479574371
of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of	 57.862843911515775
splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.	 21.79857748002151
"And of this place," thought she, "I might have been mistress! With	 45.508953811719635
these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of	 23.962215263845426
viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and	 43.23067219089241
welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.--But no,"--recollecting	 52.06673986370348
herself,--"that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost	 28.57435606801849
to me: I should not have been allowed to invite them."	 20.603140276000218
This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.	 46.57453052614552
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really	 42.771292191111456
absent, but had not courage for it. At length, however, the question was	 34.6855056156018
asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds	 32.17729442695253
replied, that he was, adding, "but we expect him to-morrow, with a	 33.67655958021277
large party of friends." How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own	 126.52885397256921
journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!	 65.71342479232823
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached, and saw	 46.05216540085164
the likeness of Mr. Wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures,	 19.896079187149585
over the mantle-piece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.	 32.11224013970561
The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a	 27.559771525327672
young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been	 25.532911338155298
brought up by him at his own expence.--"He is now gone into the army,"	 33.30645300309891
she added, "but I am afraid he has turned out very wild."	 37.8847834986445
Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not	 12.880718244059185
return it.	 277.57033295876374
"And that," said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,	 27.703238111202605
"is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the	 44.99887220757097
other--about eight years ago."	 15.993925670744922
"I have heard much of your master's fine person," said Mrs. Gardiner,	 20.293178472236036
looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell	 33.163538300206234
us whether it is like or not."	 114.08946000209133
Mrs. Reynolds's respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this	 70.49724190445384
intimation of her knowing her master.	 43.66895620870378
"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?"	 94.95018281492973
Elizabeth coloured, and said--"A little."	 47.1726401785616
"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, Ma'am?"	 19.00028082991293
"Yes, very handsome."	 371.90290525267756
"I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you	 34.80922138428125
will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late	 93.26714784984856
master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to	 25.55842040592947
be then. He was very fond of them."	 47.19306513241023
This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.	 46.495795950937264
Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn	 29.436409648382
when she was only eight years old.	 12.498278342658526
"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?" said Mr. Gardiner.	 32.90334906743286
"Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so	 72.87660922675637
accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a	 56.58010026572996
new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she	 107.59623246411677
comes here to-morrow with him."	 52.204123760523295
Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her	 28.04309233823931
communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either	 46.7483871259
from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her	 37.64602207133354
master and his sister.	 72.68041579179744
"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?"	 30.671562407242334
"Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his	 21.0249976672786
time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months."	 38.27072839682495
"Except," thought Elizabeth, "when she goes to Ramsgate."	 59.44746633792894
"If your master would marry, you might see more of him."	 90.00260140612386
"Yes, Sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is	 22.163088397461557
good enough for him."	 25.98390026949914
Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, "It is	 14.413228315375594
very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so."	 30.108052088866753
"I say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows	 27.305554857684466
him," replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;	 64.4518373527265
and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,	 38.82565213972804
"I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him	 20.59050591619044
ever since he was four years old."	 23.826293747039667
This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her	 34.21163555065331
ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest	 24.45874528883564
opinion. Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more,	 45.4100264421721
and was grateful to her uncle for saying,	 49.470045261338775
"There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in	 35.326870378993675
having such a master."	 156.0231639010298
"Yes, Sir, I know I am. If I was to go through the world, I could not	 33.43994014302383
meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are	 48.44362169428223
good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he	 64.62691046362427
was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the	 26.971702014956975
world."	 1776.0554050801775
Elizabeth almost stared at her.--"Can this be Mr. Darcy!" thought she.	 71.37545415225114
"His father was an excellent man," said Mrs. Gardiner.	 33.87198932539582
"Yes, Ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just	 33.82690210462888
as affable to the poor."	 47.700401095711015
Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.	 47.93758152816581
Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subject	 66.40835783943689
of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the	 11.751924485128585
furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family	 53.92989395376349
prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her	 30.42475819357393
master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his	 34.974551890047714
many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.	 56.28836433995396
"He is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever	 43.996158744919825
lived. Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but	 79.02878627897628
themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will	 28.187578340722236
give him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never	 15.411962600683996
saw any thing of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle	 22.98721089052063
away like other young men."	 76.77896285453254
"In what an amiable light does this place him!" thought Elizabeth.	 74.14730573040679
"This fine account of him," whispered her aunt, as they walked, "is not	 41.53604271630565
quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend."	 28.300583928467425
"Perhaps we might be deceived."	 43.22148078575476
"That is not very likely; our authority was too good."	 26.66870251262287
On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very	 24.15327623907995
pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and	 24.7076956375518
lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but	 28.73681925368317
just done, to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the	 25.92520462749764
room, when last at Pemberley.	 257.110193203163
"He is certainly a good brother," said Elizabeth, as she walked towards	 16.882958836138542
one of the windows.	 29.895185889072593
Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter	 24.15244662693768
the room. "And this is always the way with him," she added.--"Whatever	 45.864289607517115
can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment. There	 44.37596644409643
is nothing he would not do for her."	 41.90347471619501
The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were	 26.04765467660549
all that remained to be shewn. In the former were many good paintings;	 33.73341787367301
but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already	 32.7680233401803
visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss	 28.31903407470774
Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and	 35.488875121760955
also more intelligible.	 122.97744277522231
In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have	 30.454156260922833
little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked on in quest	 32.70252969711625
of the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it	 22.923148575226637
arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with	 21.59172846090045
such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,	 43.538045439092194
when he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture in	 27.68163824348696
earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the	 49.29067101259855
gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his	 28.276591769155285
father's life time.	 1122.9068899449421
There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle	 51.886751459191366
sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of	 17.309193796253883
their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds	 49.71661646454153
was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise	 78.43485485757002
of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she	 81.57836953860756
considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--How	 39.62047777936843
much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--How much of	 30.829732473771227
good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought	 33.55908717274235
forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she	 37.842806589006024
stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes	 54.938793897639925
upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of	 26.10241566918881
gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and	 37.85163488262751
softened its impropriety of expression.	 95.26229822881757
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,	 58.03523422638838
they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were	 30.84536962713915
consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.	 42.12556084502344
As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back	 18.167412159533317
to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was	 22.004704624746786
conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself	 12.111583985283538
suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.	 29.419085754871126
They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his	 23.108423723115333
appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes	 65.806163512411
instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest	 31.02920161974937
blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from	 37.97025886220903
surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,	 80.93750404121958
and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least	 34.15706471824778
of perfect civility.	 59.776064897514345
She had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach,	 14.835471398866025
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be	 39.226134825953885
overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture	 75.63875240259995
they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two	 39.923000391096785
that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on	 33.3423279522743
beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little	 66.36495304891865
aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,	 20.95908467532952
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she	 35.99592516156681
returned to his civil enquiries after her family. Amazed at the	 17.410806925041157
alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he	 54.203264410556464
uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the	 31.807992966434096
impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few	 54.38464567500502
minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most	 59.45331571409125
uncomfortable of her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he	 47.76609610062781
spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his	 45.32510781073759
enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay	 33.28114569529404
in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the	 40.49231647610636
distraction of his thoughts.	 21.918060558065438
At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few	 19.589537338482785
moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took	 40.02132037497333
leave.	 2744.967078758387
The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his	 39.98257732656567
figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own	 26.06190690190193
feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and	 25.816013780294437
vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged	 44.32284961844484
thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a	 35.406187848060306
disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if	 55.173188145846844
she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?	 30.1466662534288
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been	 51.59237539620904
only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his	 14.194845776061937
discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that	 20.236899664776676
moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and	 47.61196480265607
again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so	 41.151417082226395
strikingly altered,--what could it mean? That he should even speak to	 38.73667167769902
her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her	 30.987081078323783
family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,	 53.492961602079404
never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.	 50.82405467816125
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park, when	 38.709763239340944
he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, nor how to	 54.687409884200996
account for it.	 184.935922783272
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and	 19.69250650549595
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer	 39.19413610300437
reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time	 27.31867275520958
before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered	 41.49649754811797
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed	 18.88553732198194
to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she	 42.93232819610228
distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that	 28.255777261699695
one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then	 36.832989905520556
was. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in	 30.37372351281076
what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing,	 34.26365773198892
she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil, only because he	 50.02504131926759
felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was	 59.46541164849271
not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing	 53.40591554617506
her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with	 37.95119501123629
composure.	 7432.255774507623
At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind	 25.184300154836304
roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.	 63.31303601892176
They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,	 30.911836726215817
ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening	 21.55080925689235
of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of	 45.94583276971889
the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods	 37.240405717202535
overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner	 34.21161642563071
expressed a wish of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be	 33.29196450601521
beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten	 30.27425868041162
miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed	 46.76232671924507
circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among	 28.44100511865222
hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts.	 15.72327242250241
They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of	 24.832851466525444
the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and	 29.865533455661225
the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the	 68.54099978424902
stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered	 23.592567578500685
it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed	 33.283472721627255
the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,	 22.982762227536153
who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of	 33.301251480023296
returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,	 44.276636500567044
therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house	 27.99046839594952
on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their	 21.76168283009973
progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the	 36.95743678322196
taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the	 24.69802146948715
occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man	 32.09359019944427
about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this	 50.35199804494247
slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was	 21.637026187142794
quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy	 18.826809848144997
approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less	 109.01562748883862
sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they	 16.027592649775762
met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an	 51.58680449830237
interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with	 49.24051025031616
calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,	 19.642684235806513
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. This idea	 35.88983934255964
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the	 46.78455226064661
turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw,	 47.01668014290668
that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his	 19.928558246027944
politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;	 69.37056115567316
but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when	 31.181473726724544
some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of	 42.949024039933654
Pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed. Her colour	 61.86064963125421
changed, and she said no more.	 58.627542319396554
Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked	 22.98620805669079
her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.	 38.1958129538556
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and	 33.664627363117376
she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the	 23.964173790059817
acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had	 66.48404987570233
revolted, in his offer to herself. "What will be his surprise," thought	 88.95385400921651
she, "when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of	 131.8216938590054
fashion."	 7596.080509339205
The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their	 61.08159339030109
relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore	 30.92674428673127
it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he	 32.538563114697425
could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the	 33.268614822056435
connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so	 39.008846511446336
far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into	 27.46664323985192
conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,	 28.951411063295083
could not but triumph. It was consoling, that he should know she had	 23.96118740078324
some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most	 59.20722219777406
attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every	 21.792976479616083
expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,	 47.281999483577316
his taste, or his good manners.	 110.57460579091791
The conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard Mr. Darcy	 33.16142919513084
invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he	 39.729270408534575
chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same	 38.74439721650446
time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of	 30.573226388924486
the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was	 24.88811049895635
walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her	 31.996018563718312
wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the	 81.87935722025054
compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was	 120.23420833265632
extreme; and continually was she repeating, "Why is he so altered? From	 58.007333052762114
what can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake	 26.770505917569615
that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not	 28.450477101192504
work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love	 38.353981454780325
me."	 737.0434954215007
After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two	 25.084436734863765
gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the	 31.731665729541856
brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious	 14.754222426202741
water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in	 39.67204858164239
Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found	 15.893608407792284
Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred	 44.435629877152834
her husband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on	 27.45642431228961
together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him to	 24.65268280502491
know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the	 20.736688547185107
place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been	 46.02777909579919
very unexpected--"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that	 44.22991554404998
you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we	 37.94126111937446
left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in	 53.520114451206084
the country." He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that	 43.12668396180728
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours	 38.7782007678409
before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. "They	 26.06194838702715
will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some	 88.66804983644569
who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. Bingley and his sisters."	 59.43376511883156
Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly	 39.021630311584005
driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been last mentioned	 64.98235353640986
between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was	 27.070616702507927
not very differently engaged.	 50.03044256239578
"There is also one other person in the party," he continued after a	 32.44478221113391
pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you,--Will you allow	 72.29980700931945
me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance	 39.18626828668254
during your stay at Lambton?"	 80.10000839908713
The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great	 38.38668543598535
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt	 57.60616144869881
that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,	 44.329289327511546
must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was	 27.72797648707964
satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made	 19.279444715809
him think really ill of her.	 43.1762658119487
They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth	 45.70939828660736
was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and	 39.731134430224095
pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of	 46.25130597807013
the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had	 54.277385933011495
reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a	 30.616006305325925
mile behind.	 157.83721294672492
He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not	 26.80532870443359
tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time, much might	 31.55870104618542
have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but	 84.49792507864217
there seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that	 34.58019155832378
she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with	 15.1421508650814
great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience	 71.57005528359404
and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over. On	 35.93006055908824
Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the	 16.22581177848428
house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted	 39.01655072842081
on each side with the utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the ladies	 26.15757719290905
into the carriage, and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking	 45.99980222124543
slowly towards the house.	 24.833038776002514
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them	 22.55097358968662
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.	 25.797105087352413
"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle.	 20.187422635362612
"There _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure," replied her	 24.890149469273943
aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now	 32.3327833845852
say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,	 47.92844435748245
_I_ have seen nothing of it."	 21.40961987478032
"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more	 24.940198867443797
than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such	 26.758215809849716
attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling."	 49.20947227943952
"To be sure, Lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as Wickham;	 16.30340827147056
or rather he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are	 50.33132769245323
perfectly good. But how came you to tell us that he was so	 39.00053552031681
disagreeable?"	 1974.0752064033145
Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked	 22.185962245303962
him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never	 38.07105461559698
seen him so pleasant as this morning.	 35.080878895067016
"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied	 17.396809456437378
her uncle. "Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him	 57.30974538687278
at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and	 68.8232874448937
warn me off his grounds."	 64.65986488542008
Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said	 30.952872274675236
nothing.	 421.23545976312556
"From what we have seen of him," continued Mrs. Gardiner, "I really	 44.44722361282732
should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by	 23.968826549104882
any body, as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured	 37.0356886887578
look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when	 28.67424735074717
he speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that	 32.01930421921277
would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But to be sure,	 33.619382253461794
the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming	 43.011431011187916
character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a	 22.9140842912097
liberal master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant	 46.344667722333355
comprehends every virtue."	 33.41331885719835
Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of	 29.851688830275858
his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as	 33.20573492030098
guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his	 59.164366718427466
relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different	 34.485517741360304
construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor	 17.629463296164975
Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In	 43.15407466299343
confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary	 23.172310536819282
transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming	 19.092989798947414
her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.	 26.705021255924105
Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now	 24.181866052896087
approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to	 23.051352776836563
the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out	 18.9709675100248
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of	 36.572680171011626
any thing else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had	 28.73524720358116
no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former	 23.78517219571691
acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an	 16.223470146914188
intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.	 35.14421952967052
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth	 27.50666313551021
much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing	 44.955598044316766
but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and above	 58.32858012466444
all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.	 34.25901015762487
CHAPTER II.	 12.911953956184709
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit	 28.168131716142884
her, the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently	 41.54823128668493
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.	 35.2563025247519
But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own	 40.9288575171454
arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the	 34.72734077518431
place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn	 22.22860471746006
to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a	 27.64896426990158
carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a	 50.01014602575064
curricle, driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognising the	 30.40069197706461
livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise	 54.72031578060694
to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she	 36.383432070913244
expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment	 37.783205881283024
of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many	 37.0803990625274
of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on	 41.20516241854787
the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt	 80.7176262370432
that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such	 20.72278618234037
a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these	 60.60165602709232
newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of	 15.793570208928058
Elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing. She was quite amazed	 31.37495456989975
at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she	 41.293024114041444
dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in	 37.40967398277308
her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally	 47.04108790493021
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.	 64.75136184173722
She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked	 25.813548297315847
up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks	 35.55657982088775
of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse.	 34.00757853536639
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction	 54.16387287091009
took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see, that her new	 49.99723345773913
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her	 36.22620224777448
being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;	 26.95147805754426
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was	 19.689770069965135
only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from	 35.1107296740995
her beyond a monosyllable.	 42.62775815255749
Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though	 42.57871030660503
little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance	 31.94527523479277
womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother, but there	 23.818522486125595
was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly	 29.65650540507973
unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as	 60.880546775742644
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much	 38.876235616189355
relieved by discerning such different feelings.	 50.64913769282731
They had not been long together, before Darcy told her that Bingley was	 26.145078103097227
also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her	 44.81234176395448
satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step	 39.85054159893273
was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All	 35.596547740804056
Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she	 37.504134258118164
still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the	 73.70151672868803
unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her	 26.5382962322148
again. He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family,	 60.61904040786486
and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever	 41.057843255661794
done.	 1195.0020421613565
To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage	 24.874751884940466
than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before	 39.1688915210135
them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just	 56.61158788692568
arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards	 13.207389046049146
each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from	 47.88868440619343
those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what	 36.49172561924593
it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in	 74.21076594072215
doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was	 52.462168260906736
evident enough.	 526.6182688894908
Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the	 33.552159045283595
feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to	 35.87837609080534
make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she	 35.82776659648256
feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she	 41.72689865675545
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley	 43.774219365004626
was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.	 48.86936943054855
In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!	 29.43316789964944
how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a	 42.170141497949686
like manner. Sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on	 63.08042765910631
former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that	 52.18306484481468
as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But, though	 28.96148009649293
this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour	 23.931082378617308
to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane. No look appeared	 33.63908136592056
on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between	 94.64760077033924
them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was	 32.22951017940304
soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they	 60.07413232603771
parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of	 57.77313968045718
Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that	 60.074351777458794
might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed to her, at a	 48.50605914064035
moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had	 20.874307495543707
something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had	 24.096553463110837
the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "It	 28.26869249311052
is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when	 27.044829104313123
we were all dancing together at Netherfield."	 30.793343865755933
Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards	 48.75821150629171
took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest,	 66.37873778409624
whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the	 30.597904147498777
question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner	 39.6612141625399
which gave them meaning.	 32.46735500946202
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but,	 29.340229674313875
whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general	 44.80001384993185
complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far	 32.713040662776535
removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that	 28.728672069543826
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however	 49.443171404186444
temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When	 52.9630992220451
she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion	 23.466533200903346
of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a	 24.84174296229699
disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the	 41.805100504202166
very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last	 79.00115530056709
lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so	 87.94538017169295
great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly	 58.64101139913179
restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company	 39.74455150904657
of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at	 34.970903058467265
Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from	 32.7901094308891
self-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could	 48.35055763650814
result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the	 34.643033805970155
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw	 76.43805016220229
down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and	 25.53783421341717
Rosings.	 1318.7954488160688
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose	 22.890969543126136
to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing	 25.58665317087031
their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner	 34.481726204655416
at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a	 44.87079105067845
diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,	 20.34407689345299
readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing	 21.02204938795727
how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its	 114.0203142642182
acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming, however,	 27.722742636988357
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than	 55.81188569562736
any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of	 35.58474385440952
society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for	 29.787636233619388
her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.	 32.52281813965109
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth	 35.36361528532554
again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to	 46.35278558074959
make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all	 121.3990687543936
this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on	 34.83845303916046
this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors	 34.80201850136634
left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some	 43.84625664239974
satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been	 41.058816882585056
little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her	 37.862604755244476
uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their	 37.666000150665305
favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.	 39.009187800686405
But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was	 23.519674019310745
not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was	 34.66756214337567
much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;	 16.27144467843345
it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to	 17.930577200312477
interest, but nothing to justify enquiry.	 57.3272068359717
Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far	 25.200744553084103
as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could	 36.33029797744188
not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character	 37.727402034774656
from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference	 26.996349155585968
to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known,	 43.16324738348953
would not have recognised it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,	 24.568662077322827
however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible,	 93.2374392172426
that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four	 26.968251275199137
years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be	 23.301037843299508
hastily rejected. Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of	 18.721450471736517
their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight. They	 44.609971029459935
had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if	 85.99451401958179
not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small	 15.092078742048763
market-town, where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged,	 33.529903012741194
however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.	 43.073371314601694
With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held	 25.555303301039658
there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the	 43.414087123315255
son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known	 45.628563645673616
fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind	 55.320414045900556
him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.	 54.5007959527867
As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than	 78.63169346618393
the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not	 75.45192173056202
long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and	 39.77296405161381
she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. She	 30.887924303191014
certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she	 29.199267888035937
had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,	 73.59440622642471
that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his	 38.289311267893524
valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some	 102.20026246122708
time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened	 29.541664355589702
into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his	 38.26971756661238
favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,	 74.43320142990291
which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,	 119.23381300438687
there was a motive within her of good will which could not be	 35.952099816627005
overlooked. It was gratitude.--Gratitude, not merely for having once	 28.271018123922346
loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the	 99.08649625144908
petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the	 17.31104249749388
unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been	 32.49419388326786
persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this	 128.4596918670853
accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without	 40.65449323273231
any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where	 38.009678959053346
their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion	 76.83889014081012
of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such a	 27.314855460412435
change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but	 71.9801979273822
gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such	 64.49603040105566
its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means	 43.686165308840884
unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected, she	 24.265506627532837
esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his	 33.24304905849916
welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to	 27.196093303211686
depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both	 32.6468004458442
that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still	 66.90610387775119
possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.	 22.487278365387766
It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that	 28.319317483831604
such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's, in coming to them on the very	 42.885416634794375
day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late	 41.41704042679609
breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by	 19.15612003239873
some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it	 31.085444040941862
would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following	 29.124014805261847
morning. They were, therefore, to go.--Elizabeth was pleased, though,	 71.09700618568773
when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.	 43.353846855866934
Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been	 27.766230808974807
renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting	 62.60118103592047
some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.	 36.192481845608334
CHAPTER III.	 12.911953956184709
Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had	 81.08429280672061
originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome	 11.791570539274174
her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with	 36.69488656843377
how much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be	 44.410176661667215
renewed.	 4957.375175091107
On reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon,	 23.282799779958488
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows	 85.48228137743537
opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody	 24.349665653606717
hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts	 22.162707401884063
which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.	 27.32102716872811
In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there	 32.06239719410805
with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in	 22.438736131694252
London. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with	 59.52164163628122
all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the	 44.22575169682381
fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves	 93.02693406570513
inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and	 19.779457692647963
her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.	 41.49547574433199
By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and	 18.519726418078328
on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,	 38.44788641786248
succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a	 28.88534591564166
genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind	 68.76727981347022
of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the	 24.508393809898674
others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from	 53.63382435876019
Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she	 43.915428420470995
wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a	 46.647640656501665
short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.	 40.16625034160796
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,	 38.021737578839684
and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without	 16.50410199763462
calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her	 33.214242910079854
from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an	 52.31561338703862
inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity	 25.885818171016904
of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every	 54.39096182523817
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she	 43.10379288115113
feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether	 37.11843203786444
she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After	 82.38427556633297
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss	 50.35502313649194
Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold	 47.595095904768044
enquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal	 29.646363104549
indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.	 33.056721517975596
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the	 30.997939175371496
entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the	 27.15891114659492
finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a	 24.007654184894093
significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been	 49.03792097553552
given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole	 25.56948837513387
party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the	 43.88984042931548
beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected	 29.464318900502462
them round the table.	 64.39028754038533
While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether	 74.0822505180364
she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the	 19.57074624582366
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but	 30.709787579261157
a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to	 33.38256683087401
regret that he came.	 73.51038093401343
He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other	 28.80900019865209
gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him	 40.65400949844027
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to	 28.45088016320072
Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely	 76.64813741789972
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more	 51.966895775741754
necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she	 39.773240115931735
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,	 17.803822022208664
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour	 20.939873834194366
when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive	 27.3451807914245
curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the	 41.6441455600132
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its	 29.651033929322004
objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions	 39.933126942347464
to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's	 28.455157327359906
entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he	 35.6569648655087
was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,	 52.88520660831405
as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss	 21.3158323059707
Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the	 45.33112343519729
first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,	 46.961288354804935
"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?	 53.61238730673138
They must be a great loss to _your_ family."	 20.257135596459932
In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth	 23.60296672135335
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the	 22.571613982306356
various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;	 24.079983029279248
but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she	 37.479451049540714
presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While	 44.17988933055825
she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened	 71.30098222697035
complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with	 23.215999185909038
confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what	 52.84046592896694
pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have	 43.95287806957938
refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose	 17.5769127835815
Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed	 20.84085289740004
her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in	 18.85851914539517
Darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and	 26.204843381740595
absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that	 30.71445488301899
corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated	 38.79416737235379
elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was	 64.29522418032116
possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her	 68.07663298467854
brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish	 72.53880279733929
which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming	 24.041815074418842
hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without	 35.50882249077611
meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss	 41.57917741583833
Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern	 29.78129639896568
for the welfare of his friend.	 14.53947009292293
Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and	 45.512855541041546
as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to	 24.881808748967718
Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able	 73.41978852912497
to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely	 115.13159824587198
recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which	 45.078908386831486
had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have	 41.35923981163663
fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.	 103.51841545450488
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer	 31.824802912050227
above-mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their	 22.904748415215003
carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on	 43.362877326487194
Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join	 62.00961107372291
her. Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his	 54.55123882271999
judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as	 43.58914761755424
to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than	 35.89506227815216
lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley	 26.107115610206755
could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to	 17.405882706128086
his sister.	 58.371224648704136
"How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy," she cried; "I	 29.316937628547368
never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter.	 28.393817183330157
She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we	 24.78935508996837
should not have known her again."	 30.726603428817004
However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented	 35.488991889622135
himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than	 30.0392742700305
her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the	 35.514512810269885
summer.	 3758.095209595247
"For my own part," she rejoined, "I must confess that I never could see	 33.19554763427214
any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no	 78.50290253734646
brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants	 27.79404140311492
character; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are	 55.14029101265002
tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which	 86.68863498295282
have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive any thing	 34.92264804418992
extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not	 39.5372626696849
like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency	 38.16097590767125
without fashion, which is intolerable."	 63.847264865585636
Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not	 68.93050584461835
the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always	 31.542715284654104
wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the	 34.49121616425667
success she expected. He was resolutely silent however; and, from a	 41.11075962517852
determination of making him speak, she continued,	 56.60216896810532
"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all	 32.68833552348688
were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect	 26.428310214156173
your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_	 49.4072004891045
a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she	 89.97156632412387
seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at	 33.00091094383146
one time."	 133.19514404575503
"Yes," replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, "but _that_	 34.45470303305643
was only when I first knew her, for it is many months since I have	 26.834264802233157
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."	 35.06657555265544
He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of	 19.1264715350264
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.	 53.092887929933056
Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during	 30.693343140685112
their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested	 46.61300768220983
them both. The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were	 59.706313888837926
discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.	 51.97229332831847
They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every	 53.31704777119196
thing but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner	 38.85814664948966
thought of him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by	 15.561391441463973
her niece's beginning the subject.	 45.486747072416925
CHAPTER IV.	 12.911953956184709
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from	 27.694649681749443
Jane, on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had	 35.054409570947904
been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but	 36.939602383092975
on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the	 35.70222546270552
receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that	 41.96037459449626
it had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as	 25.74913951010773
Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.	 49.159965424355356
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her	 30.090152848282393
uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by	 32.16549940558442
themselves. The one missent must be first attended to; it had been	 62.80250101221134
written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their	 32.4440004207478
little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;	 34.351588083896075
but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident	 59.64081551384315
agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:	 51.69906602385138
"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of	 72.09285675216141
a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming	 21.139009213912253
you--be assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to	 38.415114278956615
poor Lydia. An express came at twelve last night, just as we were	 69.54550619365762
all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was	 28.619970531801677
gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth,	 61.7007721439584
with Wickham!--Imagine our surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not	 55.394514417801595
seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very sorry. So imprudent a	 41.237831134228344
match on both sides!--But I am willing to hope the best, and that	 54.120554654299966
his character has been misunderstood. Thoughtless and indiscreet I	 18.301206730766243
can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it)	 32.409906930839995
marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is disinterested at least,	 51.76150455341409
for he must know my father can give her nothing. Our poor mother	 40.30158622468437
is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How thankful am I,	 51.60142021512992
that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must	 40.824162831390076
forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about twelve, as	 82.0684911366647
is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at	 56.934805579775016
eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must	 101.9643197864395
have passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason	 21.891918014373587
to expect him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife,	 58.76044274597005
informing her of their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be	 36.81530513010008
long from my poor mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make	 14.932993203156945
it out, but I hardly know what I have written."	 25.082885243008256
Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing	 77.97444044664002
what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the	 44.109809258218824
other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it	 48.35374447657938
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.	 32.9790337926486
"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried	 42.7416984687822
letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not	 46.884210425505266
confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer	 31.03843915803606
for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would	 25.74510401660198
write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.	 32.633321432683964
Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia	 60.75591011649419
would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for	 39.191466793186585
there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland.	 17.50062267924383
Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day	 28.172842466459947
before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's short	 46.67160348406932
letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to	 20.12118895914036
Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief	 43.70995150601304
that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which	 42.796945216953254
was repeated to Colonel F. who instantly taking the alarm, set off	 27.203482365905412
from B. intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to	 36.78917055455405
Clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed	 70.92946119276812
into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them	 29.807225979120282
from Epsom. All that is known after this is, that they were seen	 66.70485700225298
to continue the London road. I know not what to think. After making	 41.1404224485384
every possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into	 51.31364808531829
Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at	 37.11657389991323
the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success, no such	 27.85193483214951
people had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern he	 43.445597524331845
came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner	 41.373436416529486
most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and	 30.05429661633175
Mrs. F. but no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my	 40.44872536047482
dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the worst,	 65.48401291028176
but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it	 30.136962447174653
more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to	 56.06930158889762
pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design	 31.71219608994087
against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely,	 25.537788940526394
can I suppose her so lost to every thing?--Impossible. I grieve to	 60.35445268275172
find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their	 45.57062512670524
marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he	 32.13248497341977
feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill	 33.12518559888121
and keeps her room. Could she exert herself it would be better, but	 27.87433991623254
this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life	 22.740649501064617
saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed	 59.30028401995852
their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot	 34.3242616460128
wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared	 17.24448337054417
something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock	 45.964174620321096
is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so	 72.18166744497954
selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu. I	 33.318740079673745
take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not,	 45.01186024639473
but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging	 32.20595683576255
you all to come here, as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and	 25.49196644623448
aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have	 19.588314872137737
still something more to ask of the former. My father is going to	 42.39405645751747
London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What	 56.921919080480755
he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress	 31.447720004166943
will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest	 28.944531458668543
way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again	 28.930318631476997
to-morrow evening. In such an exigence my uncle's advice and	 27.2356247622856
assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately	 38.70474241058026
comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness."	 44.25378869409357
"Oh! where, where is my uncle?" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat	 36.799394796827144
as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a	 34.2870713913521
moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was	 39.96236090693881
opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous	 33.839243247204706
manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to	 35.089313118644945
speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's	 68.6378130158521
situation, hastily exclaimed, "I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.	 27.089905151271054
I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be	 51.49766506384966
delayed; I have not an instant to lose."	 47.49890130272727
"Good God! what is the matter?" cried he, with more feeling than	 53.072292401247466
politeness; then recollecting himself, "I will not detain you a minute,	 49.1460407026239
but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are	 63.67931283615371
not well enough;--you cannot go yourself."	 170.30462408176763
Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how	 31.929364686719914
little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back	 33.61863909033062
the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an	 43.2721636890991
accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and	 29.59177801160428
mistress home, instantly.	 145.0601205586466
On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and	 19.1417694490507
looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,	 33.686500977533726
or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,	 25.239311688594817
"Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take, to give you	 62.616617835901195
present relief?--A glass of wine;--shall I get you one?--You are very	 30.138597875058213
ill."	 4317.097005066534
"No, I thank you;" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. "There	 32.17359531718167
is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well. I am only distressed by	 29.490677458421622
some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn."	 25.436624799697338
She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could	 20.437325570926355
not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say	 61.87358960884772
something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate	 39.811927960765054
silence. At length, she spoke again. "I have just had a letter from	 38.86798264673235
Jane, with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from any one. My	 19.452718109134864
youngest sister has left all her friends--has eloped;--has thrown	 76.64965545558877
herself into the power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together	 45.595681671808265
from Brighton. _You_ know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no	 44.27024806969811
money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for	 108.32082494300364
ever."	 753.6941685825765
Darcy was fixed in astonishment. "When I consider," she added, in a yet	 86.77935303505065
more agitated voice, "that _I_ might have prevented it!--_I_ who knew	 54.67261222656865
what he was. Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what	 46.1708675074242
I learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not	 34.35136271194381
have happened. But it is all, all too late now."	 67.2038970696671
"I am grieved, indeed," cried Darcy; "grieved--shocked. But is it	 22.607811430803217
certain, absolutely certain?"	 100.81617578584778
"Oh yes!--They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced	 40.50375339155191
almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to	 98.89683081213508
Scotland."	 8598.018879251216
"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"	 18.215338752760854
"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's	 42.84225358804751
immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour. But	 34.53778653633823
nothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done. How is	 29.969810148902106
such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have	 29.34604965068241
not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!"	 139.32314332641423
Darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence.	 47.9522908305452
"When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character.--Oh! had I known what	 61.91637286034812
I ought, what I dared, to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too	 62.06489163331576
much. Wretched, wretched, mistake!"	 27.850652348885536
Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up	 32.13270630769791
and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air	 35.15424970074542
gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power	 101.16781428723164
was sinking; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family	 35.19186864336486
weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither	 18.131590576023942
wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing	 41.93925837832281
consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It	 26.606552853467598
was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own	 22.241054431468438
wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved	 47.93370252596002
him, as now, when all love must be vain.	 79.15613720968399
But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the	 40.89884589137515
humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up	 52.14875754158264
every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,	 25.227849985802557
Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of	 12.917873782860818
several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the	 38.0126163616654
voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke	 83.08741335552455
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "I am afraid you have been	 37.517425158015996
long desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my	 57.24038654153842
stay, but real, though unavailing, concern. Would to heaven that any	 140.4359556948016
thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer	 117.24566788087895
consolation to such distress.--But I will not torment you with vain	 37.397620809423195
wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This	 50.11317187088234
unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure	 91.27851526219513
of seeing you at Pemberley to-day."	 28.382267766084702
"Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy. Say that	 24.723080442069524
urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as	 70.88993483722659
long as it is possible.--I know it cannot be long."	 43.59421676513294
He readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for	 27.96711210193057
her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present	 54.07591044549262
reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only	 61.687023835818714
one serious, parting, look, went away.	 49.67550059665075
As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they	 24.400213284050825
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had	 56.0326621917177
marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a	 49.25350903354098
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of	 36.324399163305884
contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those	 15.191989669154472
feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would	 53.02862823246006
formerly have rejoiced in its termination.	 68.19374877299464
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's	 89.44693223606144
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if	 47.306984959610034
otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or	 76.23419397414305
unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a	 24.25110839912431
first interview with its object, and even before two words have been	 64.27787669663363
exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given	 33.031575590640166
somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,	 35.62096868844674
and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other	 40.895044790674106
less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go	 90.60729464326357
with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must	 27.104866823041025
produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched	 39.77920251477585
business. Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained	 81.30291216272117
a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,	 48.85053541183837
could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least	 28.751992357492117
of her feelings on this developement. While the contents of the first	 16.214572867777655
letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that	 65.00633872412824
Wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for	 38.202363399602454
money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared	 65.50695308332452
incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment	 24.807807103452532
as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not	 23.561300340602354
suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the	 73.76420338508589
intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither	 20.04484539034543
her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy	 44.45279503346614
prey.	 8.776652323334677
She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that	 36.86722244845377
Lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that Lydia had	 18.253493272710944
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body. Sometimes one	 29.41729323473407
officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions	 123.03570181247045
raised them in her opinion. Her affections had been continually	 50.77160179201671
fluctuating, but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and	 68.69669942587801
mistaken indulgence towards such a girl.--Oh! how acutely did she now	 79.3615356914072
feel it.	 76.17080270074008
She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to	 59.01689152136461
share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a	 57.276970648199054
family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and	 28.051157808513942
requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing	 27.48637943790114
could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost	 55.14094641331095
importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience	 39.98426376972986
was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,	 49.390780947111935
by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but	 21.11310612934722
satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the	 27.373652135793677
cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on	 31.56776150624513
the postscript of the last, with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had	 24.86159897738074
never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be	 29.502978143283368
deeply affected. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after	 94.54404247079694
the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily	 22.159170975027916
promised every assistance in his power.--Elizabeth, though expecting no	 57.287420742657446
less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated	 74.65122604263065
by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily	 37.29674381470696
settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. "But what is to be	 24.09321782482624
done about Pemberley?" cried Mrs. Gardiner. "John told us Mr. Darcy was	 69.84051096753794
here when you sent for us;--was it so?"	 75.0815113218349
"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.	 23.351370651984478
_That_ is all settled."	 22.432470655002298
"That is all settled;" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to	 23.628408840648284
prepare. "And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real	 50.12501995756407
truth! Oh, that I knew how it was!"	 49.561507254493506
But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the	 63.917702478436205
hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure	 80.26384811204224
to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was	 33.949400095457044
impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of	 41.32880219851746
business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to	 29.266532872789327
be written to all their friends in Lambton, with false excuses for their	 58.94669598423023
sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.	 44.27383525649656
Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing	 129.47559994005468
remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of	 34.01753488155459
the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could	 19.848659284258403
have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.	 60.6417049071233
CHAPTER V.	 12.911953956184709
"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," said her uncle, as they	 37.105819944287724
drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much	 114.9540809962192
more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the	 32.88703549011263
matter. It appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should	 36.02101129381545
form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or	 20.95614036813242
friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I	 31.082551081943176
am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends	 41.24315661679479
would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the	 30.146352477319464
regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is	 45.142180050549506
not adequate to the risk."	 38.24266819602549
"Do you really think so?" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.	 33.036760043281326
"Upon my word," said Mrs. Gardiner, "I begin to be of your uncle's	 15.508823486607243
opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and	 31.336791888438288
interest, for him to be guilty of it. I cannot think so very ill of	 18.462876208707137
Wickham. Can you, yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe	 68.65952493739248
him capable of it?"	 26.783004163437354
"Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. But of every other neglect	 32.49137464836782
I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not	 42.73482346859598
hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the	 57.51864376079953
case?"	 4015.9027181066112
"In the first place," replied Mr. Gardiner, "there is no absolute proof	 20.969949055549677
that they are not gone to Scotland."	 11.285642213607817
"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a	 35.66960526936484
presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the	 24.84796459986548
Barnet road."	 157.5791412278405
"Well, then--supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though	 43.76776420686238
for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose. It is	 25.79056444122778
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it	 23.728195937972224
might strike them that they could be more economically, though less	 52.67324028380892
expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland."	 164.2320872994167
"But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their	 87.36723969856442
marriage be private? Oh! no, no, this is not likely. His most particular	 114.64672294866008
friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending	 63.828964965985485
to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He	 41.34167508909886
cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she	 118.48969304564399
beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake,	 31.25547326815038
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what	 36.685238887647664
restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a	 45.18778371786906
