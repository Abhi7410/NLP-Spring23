Average Perplexity: 3.0017123142810087
jane with such dreadful news it cannot be concealed from any one my	 3.149943188591922
view of the house with weary ancles dirty stockings and a face	 4.77167636484815
thousand pounds all connection between us seemed now dissolved i	 2.2584144862159765
was a most humiliating pictureand to the pang of a friend disgracing	 4.487001703629436
to send her away and there are several of the young men too that she	 2.5406996783288913
afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately	 2.9256074537625123
elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedlyand after an awkward pause	 2.478160077512751
something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to	 3.2639173600010336
and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike	 3.996684351987903
say that he was at rosings	 4.006724110207475
daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship	 2.586909575027268
wickham and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr darcys	 3.590669208174526
a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stoodthe sort of	 3.3671645135135866
expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own	 2.42093815691622
he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down	 2.7080950679597606
him after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged with	 2.773412258040001
madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some	 3.175493849106148
looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile in a few minutes	 3.3594820634145046
which he would have thought necessary	 3.1730336914310655
pardon me for interrupting you madam cried mr collins but if she	 2.4860263895947834
it was a journey of only twentyfour miles and they began it so early	 2.358347454515416
what did you say of me that i did not deserve for though your	 3.4669774918148253
interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as	 2.5943772421424653
what an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was	 2.6013696067525642
they talked of his sister his friends his house his fruit of every	 2.9787286854061694
meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that	 3.462690620659311
repaid	 2.0190770273117145
established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorised by such	 2.70662636573435
them but so it is it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted	 3.728549801223219
subject of tenderness than of pride his sense of her inferiorityof	 2.941294463191177
possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we	 2.634657091228136
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon	 2.7160734800987028
other even as well as they intended georgiana had the highest opinion	 2.804204244200366
to a ragout had nothing to say to her	 3.589205226185931
utterly unknown to her before something he supposed might be attributed	 2.8574831040187
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions when this was	 4.476825646871208
there was certainly at this moment in elizabeths mind a more gentle	 2.3188062752113714
will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange	 3.1287602359192133
with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected it was	 2.414898604301957
themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the	 2.350304970245169
she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over	 3.4360226836361503
gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him	 3.4686412554018093
esteemed and valuedthat even wickham had allowed him merit as a	 2.668206153933909
wentand there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to	 3.307168850720955
up he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as	 4.087004752799255
not yet learnt to condemn themwith respect to that other more	 2.938525013383297
saw any thing of it to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle	 3.019667013725348
moved mr jones says we must not think of moving her we must trespass	 3.300335600734645
his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not	 2.2460825983000423
another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his	 3.1816637761345743
yes almost every day	 3.1385054336676834
insolent girl said elizabeth to herselfyou are much mistaken if	 2.5472253757264274
the tumult of elizabeths mind was allayed by this conversation she had	 3.334118814869341
as welcome to me as either of them	 2.527396559552756
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune	 2.3486082441574316
brother for talking such nonsense	 2.739105712343891
her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist	 3.0852053819055216
would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart but to be sure	 3.012941414737396
will believe me the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent	 2.8979837044949357
satisfactory to tell you mr bingley does not know the whole of his	 2.913371774776306
are satisfied	 3.3215523774044544
pure and elevating passion i should at present detest his very name	 3.2280310956535296
useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small	 2.3783592692655158
oh yesthe handsomest young lady that ever was seen and so	 2.346894565565614
disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that	 3.16420500150959
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from	 2.541161727942257
carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably	 2.9390945103780766
not at all	 3.1116920419638405
immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could	 2.241612811884692
trouble of saying as little as possible	 2.7931975411497887
i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully	 2.9294274560816125
think of nothing but of mr wickham and of what he had told her all	 3.328851860375221
the house as ever i saw he simpers and smirks and makes love to us	 3.558337470063894
respectable man who had for many years the management of all the	 3.4983402286586753
gained her point and had time to consider of it her reflections were	 2.54986965832006
it	 3.0387435075362292
the whole party in the liveliest spirits	 3.739308989333371
of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted	 2.8792752362568783
affection than she feels bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he	 2.88394665713638
be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparisonbut	 3.550903379128797
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady	 4.047914394718139
she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of	 2.8838052964554746
instantly met and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest	 3.6045028970394997
whether all her sisters were at longbourn there was not much in the	 2.8421353820481188
say in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself	 3.533567565423544
i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his	 3.1201391959836404
obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour	 2.5423225299731977
understand it i shall then give over every expectation every wish of	 2.347369598095597
approach and before she could strike into another path she was	 3.1511893446037975
on each side with the utmost politeness mr darcy handed the ladies	 3.167518813112571
from the time of year all field sports were over within doors there	 2.838286481859358
during your stay at lambton	 2.7983991467737037
to be mentioned in your hearing that is his notion of christian	 2.6402587075512067
oh my dear mr bennet as she entered the room we have had a most	 2.9045044635947646
while	 3.7548249092481343
or two when i last saw her she was not very promising i am very glad	 3.454595776502404
outside the united states us laws alone swamp our small staff	 2.5539760997293617
to oakham mount this morning it is a nice long walk and mr darcy has	 3.70291990020429
and her children should go to london at the same time that mr bennet	 2.626682655887898
than any other person	 3.68398154635801
most disagreeable such were the gentle murmurs of mrs bennet and they	 4.000571561503876
in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a	 3.621575483989323
look on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when	 3.4181580803059415
mercenary and she shall be foolish	 3.1270304232530783
intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to	 3.0037176559793246
these are not janes feelings she is not acting by design as yet she	 2.7418409140708846
interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with	 2.5539575091716693
a haunch the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the	 3.377042445147948
partner for a couple of dances can give the moment of her release from	 3.8748806119492536
in your eyes i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life	 2.8863708972261395
coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of every	 3.446427986605522
was elizabeths intimate friend	 2.813891321885599
countenance elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first	 2.6858834412312103
home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think	 2.8979055348605756
if the same circumstances were to happen again i am sure i should	 2.583790085616059
springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the	 2.8833925050937026
he readily assured her of his secrecyagain expressed his sorrow for	 3.339854652942942
was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was	 2.349780887800113
i beg your pardonone knows exactly what to think	 2.8802094284551965
miss lucas was odious to her as her successor in that house she	 3.9706717290958005
jane shook her head	 3.23983469253059
father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the	 2.8017201985927582
the first class	 3.0782180878960697
and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful	 3.4679950610076276
house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally	 3.8199781522880647
melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings to rosings he then	 2.155045591300402
there is no danger of wickhams marrying mary king theres for you she	 2.918291542789623
redistribution	 2.0190770273117145
for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an	 3.339341766557483
nothing	 3.405782374916113
his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bennet his marriage was	 2.776211295995635
were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been	 2.3581739537159194
were to meet us at the church well monday morning came and i was in	 2.9942031583460267
feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily	 2.6527936764050746
catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a	 2.815873068784833
feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been	 2.253359402782809
copying distributing performing displaying or creating derivative	 3.382662644632617
they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of	 3.344404308064561
attempt to place him in an amiable light i am not equal to it wickham	 2.8004353394899
an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr	 3.3416843545269903
very greatly to my happiness and thirdlywhich perhaps i ought to have	 2.5829740361733435
this will not do said elizabeth you never will be able to make both	 2.6975085583323324
opinion her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more	 3.848864324209991
on these occasions mrs gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeths	 3.667189047089272
himself was no very difficult point to persuade him against	 2.2566427868499868
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise	 2.717502705076994
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partneryou	 2.6204490809906082
had been too ingenious for her on opening the door she perceived her	 2.6336007792823937
when at length they arose to take leave mrs bennet was most pressingly	 3.1882153060230585
hopeless it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that	 2.9933856346570407
had ventured only one glance at darcy he looked serious as usual and	 2.6091767338204934
for the indulgence of some music miss bingley moved with alacrity to	 4.293306913255564
have passed within ten miles of us colonel forster gives us reason	 2.274928125031617
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in	 2.2924968551713087
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however	 2.9494427611997858
not adequate to the risk	 4.098781726234067
magnitude you last night laid to my charge the first mentioned	 2.702557441742933
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour as for	 3.3694075872512603
their intending to go off had colonel forster seen denny himself	 2.4534055797684857
was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had	 2.994844583851126
think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements	 2.606648101985335
kept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went	 3.12063749379913
neighbours in meryton	 3.16562952415146
dont think me angry however for i only mean to let you know	 2.179328845935909
she urged jane to borrow mr bingleys carriage immediately and at	 2.8479876259382624
certainly did not hate him no hatred had vanished long ago and she	 3.3157672238301896
good heavens cried elizabeth but how could that behow could	 2.674483605872629
objectionable if they believed him attached to me they would not try	 2.973714879559059
elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after	 2.8300395078946967
necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she	 2.356562524780352
elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection	 2.7683323287915704
and lydia but while they were supported by their mothers indulgence	 3.0177937693609356
delight	 3.7803284013615666
in which you have been brought up	 3.4277331872610937
bingley was uncivil to her and more teazing than usual to himself	 4.207426302627188
me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could	 2.81859646199638
pleasantest preservative from want this preservative she had now	 3.2530343822690657
they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and	 4.665844010649124
i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility mr darcy would	 2.8052987844982837
mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of	 2.9905927697835253
by exclamations and inquiries about the other of whom however she	 3.80792854132878
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters	 2.904575455843025
of any bodys children it should not be of my own however	 2.979398555969767
subject this will never do	 2.790726681751614
affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for	 2.418772390839507
excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay	 2.4676930076971444
compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing	 2.6711050934806155
acquaintance but that is all i have nothing either to hope or fear	 2.836374755090081
make any reply mary however continued to console herself with such	 2.9719949767251386
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their raptures	 2.5647437971728606
very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds	 2.7711513425643246
hoped that by carolines not living in the same house with her brother	 2.6806877322192437
she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that	 2.4266059168332923
bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy	 3.0643094982821064
what do you think she said besides ah mrs bennet we shall have her	 2.5767396142806662
being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in	 2.1771213965322667
jane i congratulate you you will be a very happy woman	 3.5596875589832573
them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are	 2.4642286239394844
uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the	 3.4040462504848366
question and read on at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be	 2.9165608938631675
as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business	 2.448027880643323
literary archive foundation	 3.0422681539275302
convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said	 2.8350193736886133
his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the	 3.1321296463699975
her you have a sweet room here mr bingley and a charming prospect	 2.905320554040865
out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me	 3.1836161576002873
likely to be in this country much longer	 3.3459681604905227
wanted to counteract her mothers schemes	 3.530040983172055
professor michael s hart was the originator of the project gutenbergtm	 4.233844560390016
elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on her briefly	 3.6218402559299308
of which prudence forbad the disclosure she dared not relate the other	 3.5901333036167373
therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent	 3.139380272810384
furniture in vain mr gardiner highly amused by the kind of family	 3.00888286668329
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit	 3.652026749745464
mr bennet replied that he had not	 3.5849377118386787
of his friend for though jane had the most generous and forgiving	 3.297268928018203
husbands love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their	 2.735554621773074
talking of why he has four or five thousand ayear and very likely	 2.4227070935555144
if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know	 2.6787932540627994
county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three	 3.603197846337555
you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your	 3.0087445867258737
mr wickhams attention was caught and after observing mr collins for	 3.4201808140425984
from her mothers apartment immediately met her	 2.8793585122670007
walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her	 3.6165303614252853
it places mr darcy to be treating his fathers favourite in such a	 3.444318222781612
he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them	 2.530714966966715
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from	 2.792654072816682
knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mr	 3.7013454940261625
i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon	 4.247819655469168
by the servants account that their niece was taken suddenly illbut	 2.241800606373321
who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i	 3.715030778040641
himself at netherfield such amiable qualities must speak for	 2.435158941959318
go she represented to him all the improprieties of lydias general	 4.62583401118192
when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go	 2.4647241348574283
idle certainly might	 3.017897731197235
so strong an affection but his pride his abominable pride his	 2.3891888624579423
for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter and his	 2.61169283348506
scruple to call out	 2.8419298915523323
lost	 3.868378418129187
ought to have i should think you could not do better but as it isyou	 3.110467192016662
and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice	 3.2237900114455447
him capable of it	 3.4471300780479543
makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will	 2.8225554326128286
this though i doubt whether his reserve or anybodys	 2.7088184845235275
interrupted him with	 3.207980787408462
bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away	 2.5940392626465645
acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly	 3.3801425560818363
eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it he added that mr	 3.449787640159421
governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have	 2.521680970439706
then getting up walked about the room elizabeth was surprised but said	 2.6820196140964536
the first exclamations of surprise and horror mr gardiner readily	 2.8655063551767452
on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the	 4.758011632918863
exceedingly fair lady lucas began directly to calculate with more	 2.917878668125732
attachment to rosings certainly increases	 2.7734442406890056
elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of	 2.666736355774029
with you	 3.377006067593154
mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then	 2.422727058624264
moment or are the result of previous study	 3.297537556792355
very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying	 2.441375194856289
came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects	 2.5152926552887953
not very differently engaged	 3.504871875413228
the housekeeper came a respectablelooking elderly woman much less	 3.167667192438617
and that i suppose is one of your sisters	 3.2582208125483123
so doing	 3.4091522766462226
feelings appear what they were not it was necessary to laugh when she	 2.7077518541171024
especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing	 2.4761513478338806
ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great	 3.691237657218944
listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre	 2.9669573686965593
their plan and would not give his real opinion about it he did not	 2.855064612336166
feel it	 3.3184015065513175
a voice which proved it to be mr darcy she moved again towards the	 2.9421906310421893
thing in his power to satisfy us on this head but on second thoughts	 2.6149222869760487
you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy	 2.671140311431191
was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached	 4.321194148335357
unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be	 2.179458569844869
determined to make enquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible	 2.4344818254265497
approaching them and at no great distance the walk being here less	 2.2045559275616005
very very much nothing could give either bingley or myself more	 2.2042509547215596
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health	 3.111722400523035
afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr darcys	 2.884135369438387
had known any thing of the matter	 3.18444169241687
their father and motherwhen they get to our age i dare say they will	 2.7011249773909323
her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of	 3.7266939538924935
a friendly eye	 3.369042212887864
friendship and affection a regard for the requester would often make	 2.8431164850475583
in paragraph 1f3 this work is provided to you asis with no other	 4.343226525839041
could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing	 3.4956688472317885
avoiding mrs bennet as much as possible saying not much to elizabeth	 2.939256309959828
soon went away but before she had been three minutes in her own room	 2.7113306701003923
affronted by their advice and lydia selfwilled and careless would	 3.7377990059193236
returns of the delightful intercourse we have known and in the mean	 2.9475944420734765
reached the carriage mr and mrs gardiner were half a quarter of a	 3.389181699172468
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe	 3.091926831257955
gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her	 4.621963274113275
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying though he had	 2.715293974482193
afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your	 3.9007361508709355
if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he chuses	 2.855580170911729
receive a refund of the money if any you paid for it by sending a	 3.289730186831447
after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows	 2.966874689969477
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to	 2.6282125696926095
exaggeration the shocking rudeness of mr darcy	 3.567056610239484
lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been	 3.811474111160611
entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he	 2.7125145249111853
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had	 2.636852108474016
would rather have cried her father had most cruelly mortified her by	 3.516755545892675
and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own	 4.048911298894875
engaged by wickham for those very dancesand to have mr collins	 2.8887655763449764
gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing	 2.8350480810664473
lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her	 2.4953077429093136
bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations elizabeth	 2.8013617575589795
a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece while these	 2.385718473276908
you have a very small park here returned lady catherine after a short	 2.3364789539502637
and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously	 2.7519704204430333
delight in vexing me you have no compassion on my poor nerves	 2.750008458812711
he then asked her to walk into the housebut she declared herself not	 3.048300341154
it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who	 2.8993090306178475
with the officers cried lydia i wonder my aunt did not tell us of	 2.278449575321336
selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient adieu i	 3.7915279812448026
jane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy	 2.8575279437502172
question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner	 4.0795245026627445
often talk of it between themselves well if they can be easy with an	 2.2390188674642237
of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness	 2.76072603422053
any indelicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where	 4.04270256683354
either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying	 2.643164754475374
be as light as a feather	 2.9249064523596
reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only	 2.2655039795507403
to darcy	 3.3847769810093125
vexation her coming there was the most unfortunate the most illjudged	 3.2595901628285566
but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the	 2.879127539694611
this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by	 3.053088266463797
trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on	 3.951917276310434
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on	 2.555071985659102
while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not	 2.7068979166171783
elizabeth was distressed she felt that she had no business at	 3.638576974758814
all for janes sake you know and there is no occasion for talking to	 2.8011970329417126
of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of	 3.244991817532793
be written to all their friends in lambton with false excuses for their	 2.7591461035152554
i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole	 2.3571407358441654
him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him	 2.2627663734011136
receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost	 3.46704332327342
another very welcome surprise for his chief wish at present was to	 2.2032756909347486
attention the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire lest she	 3.1231484477939433
make way for her and live to see her take my place in it	 2.5435445191041217
ladyships indignation would have been what would she have saidhow	 3.0276698870523235
spare you for another fortnight	 2.7867349717196768
the evening passed quietly unmarked by any thing extraordinary the	 3.2207703237174226
and i certainly never shall give it i am not to be intimidated into	 3.2203614354595764
to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival of jane no look appeared	 3.150488182069743
lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good	 3.7227312028252473
and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him	 2.566791540858438
lydias purchases were seated in it	 2.720458882861589
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could very	 2.5663087992460336
i do not blame jane she continued for jane would have got mr	 2.5159244786340826
the country said darcy can in general supply but few subjects for	 2.567633030184903
might arise in that quarter it distressed her a little and she was	 4.00763230443477

elizabeths congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a	 3.8100483529928684
elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from	 2.2879871070782722
natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging there is	 5.110324461196465
elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant	 3.6380525088601647

immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving	 2.8739291379032155
it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth the	 2.706702109833903
novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such	 2.85427458300182
this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her	 2.640801972948165

violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it	 2.635577716846983
mr collins said she speaks highly both of lady catherine and her	 2.6063620067703615
of shame that she could hardly keep her seat it drew from her	 3.093065857046132

why my dear you must know mrs long says that netherfield is taken	 2.5249667261835795

been to blame i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression	 3.1786890492533146
was all done very well she had also to anticipate how her visit would	 2.347312106168531
without anger such treatment but sir williams good breeding carried	 2.5808787416912358
it is no such thing lydia does not leave me because she is married	 2.355322055497627
elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained	 2.4519236322095446
mrs bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned	 2.9595362910504055
looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful and	 3.240476550811097

had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as	 2.6243572731909413
story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a	 3.563211799837868
feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to	 2.962648318837962
every body away from him and her daughter elizabeth who had a letter	 2.7501302587345675
i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation replied	 2.2648367256700124
was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have	 2.457022200265677
on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and	 3.9071054008143347
sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i dare say it	 3.0435654252853426
his life	 3.354423037273703
occurred it would be dreadful she blushed at the very idea and	 4.30464229445433
mrs hurst and her sister allowed it to be sobut still they admired	 3.2375806334461066
that you should come together oh he is the handsomest young man that	 2.886615416022191
this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how	 2.705379411076401
heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage and had come to	 2.4245957897784782
know	 3.421423783470271
i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation	 2.21931175438931
i should be sorry indeed if it were we were always good friends	 2.5316597256992983
they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two	 2.8694270150879913
there had appeared very insufficient and she read it again widely	 3.3828103992044993
with what the owner said in its praise and took it immediately	 2.510512443322417
my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express themby which	 3.418790099098188
much but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no	 2.425089802990274
pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it she	 3.656671615499433
it would be an unpleasant thing	 3.6420275379734233
day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he had brought	 2.8634149619943265
length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield	 2.4926804604042716
meryton and see how every body went on but elizabeth steadily opposed	 2.514830573693917
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other	 2.6698569223803026
return it	 3.4805833503816346
it	 3.0387435075362292
exactly in unison with her opinion of each	 3.6359231648231045
by r w robert william chapman	 4.127443531847635
frequent discussion between her parents elizabeth saw directly that her	 2.6251477784701485
doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady	 3.0634390224155124
i am sure said she i cried for two days together when colonel	 2.4599136556774632
on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till	 2.3951001161339036
know whether he would be married in his blue coat	 3.3125963430967404
suppose to believe them fond of each other	 2.5833356381671098
you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on	 4.8057630559496385
and have you heard from him often	 2.729294187486339
plain vanilla ascii or other format used in the official version	 3.446312844127967
i should be so reasonable as to admit it but i wonder how long you	 3.625595423537803
1f	 2.0190770273117145
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton and the	 2.5688253151609985

advantages in my power to offer you will find her manners beyond any	 2.6504754225178697
leaving the diningparlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee	 3.5316742336040283
i am afraid mr darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper	 2.319274530606328
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her she was	 4.495401894320201
hope he will overlook it dear dear lizzy a house in town every thing	 2.698410358977627
finished it what a letter is this to be written at such a moment but	 2.5031960490930363
i desire you will do no such thing lizzy is not a bit better than the	 2.7145934257561364
over it immediately it had better have happened to you lizzy you	 2.4623566498894474
near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of	 2.442208974809572
written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by mr darcy	 2.457155528654888
talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the	 4.917933645347431
oh that my dear mother had more command over herself she can have no	 2.495590175387174
wickham is not so undeserving then as we have thought him said her	 2.743438476118222
sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham	 2.3695575871753256
from the drawingroom they could distinguish nothing in the lane and	 3.113396748902077
regained her composure and calmly replied	 2.6324501427644615
anxious parade walk up to her mothers right hand and hear her say to	 2.3001844423276236
yes sir i know i am if i was to go through the world i could not	 2.8727128013726464
catherines unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of	 3.9436058989997553
sensibility	 2.0190770273117145
can never be what we once were to each other	 2.6320029551591753
	 3.4533322466244982
kindness the day passed most pleasantly away the morning in bustle and	 2.5341722234067308
came up with him and eagerly cried out	 2.888244935134818
determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town as mr bennet	 3.505133229499476
gutenbergtm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement	 2.5212347163681463
no really replied elizabeth i think there cannot be too little said	 2.555661734642912
through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving mr	 2.98419431737959
while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enoughi	 3.0208090370134375
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections	 4.114652815764658
blame you oh no	 2.861196304853125
elizabeth made no answer she was afraid of talking longer of his	 2.4325505929169324
the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her	 3.481228867231734
detained first by the civility of mr collins whose inquiries after	 2.865936181638317
down the room together with either of which motives his joining them	 3.2113869395902594
she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed	 3.1684850877987505
mr darcythat to be in the same room the same party with him for so	 3.300284281611235
disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind	 4.187770102902626
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings	 4.07770271588242
was so thoughtful	 3.752767050625967
speculation i will leave him to himself	 2.8139608974381543
again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command she	 2.8448185322549375
clothes the wedding clothes i will write to my sister gardiner about	 2.337403831687411
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no	 2.9731107187906773
sister ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to	 3.070227319513798
to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his	 2.7244969299489874

being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend	 2.9351541441018836
that	 3.31404720177268
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to	 3.1807321771825334
to hope that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire the day	 2.229913379793326
marry you but when you have had time to think it all over i hope you	 2.785444445079273
compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by	 2.6200238032847674
more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the	 3.275042862345762
since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of	 2.142057701327026
mrs gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could not	 2.7350150819257655
darcys in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and	 2.965869111643522
soon as she possibly could she was no sooner in possession of it than	 3.8421234724090954
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was	 2.2333089033929197
did he come at all	 2.995071867538891
ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise	 2.5229379076438967
exceedingly well i should have considered it as part of my duty and	 2.7359640079726995
repugnancecauses which though still existing and existing to	 3.637066679570208
should say one of her ladyships carriages for she has several	 2.9135245705400057

freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest	 3.332902313203664
yes i have had a letter from him by express	 3.0656449590522366
when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having	 2.789757606014786
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a	 3.8418607830740674
darcys character though he had assured her that respect for the	 2.649589152115044
stranger to the particulars of your youngest sisters infamous	 2.6845268161256435
george wickham who was his godson his kindness was therefore	 2.767442464286074

married i shall have nothing to wish for	 2.967192463443495
chapter i	 2.783750536159031
herself his apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were over	 2.7157515074497285
youth as the first and to be kept back on such a motivei think it	 3.1216501494708537
of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration the	 3.01620043704003
but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham	 2.9607516208026254
raptures as mr collins expected the scene to inspire and was but	 3.0364693558457168
my dear you flatter me i certainly have had my share of beauty but	 2.8850860768000706
no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton	 2.332860134832293

unwillingly said so miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only	 3.0056321790881504
the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual	 2.3912381237959686

as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive	 3.5441991235636428
various recollections connected with him gave her a moments distress	 2.6756221515881844

behaviour than her sister	 3.1553471051623503
were to entertain each other very little was said by either kitty was	 2.40225325994544
talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying	 2.864623408239845
greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her	 3.7227744422408815

that they are not gone to scotland	 2.9347122011509548
give me no hope from law a man of honour could not have doubted the	 3.15046257954481
when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that	 3.089951237739767
to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was	 3.228810403160039
thankful that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness	 2.6348830025156196
very young woman and very lately married a resemblance in good humour	 2.657080802109727
accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of finding	 2.972489342101528

displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us	 3.443819080386435
i leave it to yourself to determine said mr bennet	 2.7093526487837534
particulars immediately following of wickhams resigning all pretensions	 2.8035105849124777

observed my friends behaviour attentively and i could then	 3.119912306473316
reason for what she did for mr collins would undoubtedly have been	 2.9743835806160632
has done	 3.4418910436814065
and a book was produced but on beholding it for every thing announced	 2.74088507961382
circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to	 3.23424432196541
intelligence every day added something to their knowledge of the	 2.4207584389105485
attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother	 3.835974683739202
bingleys voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold	 3.1013580663748868
the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far	 2.312859984215436
you may depend on it replied the other for mrs nicholls was in	 2.611468249584903
i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer	 2.3603729649545895
might arise unpleasant to more than myself	 3.6306140936789264
take it on myself	 2.9404366446287966
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of	 3.5876301087015356
seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty	 3.248028338793007
true you are a gentlemans daughter but who was your mother who	 2.626642442293385
she was shewn into the breakfastparlour where all but jane were	 3.3069817614307815
interference in the views of his friend	 4.26467061868265
for one of youand indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i	 3.0711087558490777
ah sir i do indeed it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you	 2.7344387755769057
trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which	 5.381881863792238
that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever	 3.042913405332784
regret what he had thrown away	 3.8209784469525805
indifferent would have prevented his coming down again	 2.5587473986190923
elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin	 3.298707932005706
dared not lift up her eyes how mr darcy looked therefore she could	 2.6072356764974067
mr wickhams charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could	 2.5939390918970187
yes he introduced us to his sister	 3.0565980376290525
elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference	 3.319308011171749
engaged	 3.7861225729791648
her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her	 3.068379578213814
they were hopeless of remedy her father contented with laughing at	 4.704645831285
mrs f but no one can throw any blame on them our distress my	 2.439570916061513
pull it to pieces as soon as i get home and see if i can make it up any	 2.903231956527959
was to speak for itself he called it therefore his duty to step	 2.216059805646515
lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my room	 2.4528612853339062
affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already	 2.8413873349574184
brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate	 2.8626302420086245
two young men one has got all the goodness and the other all the	 3.208209845432135
entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the	 3.9065103429182653
situation he could conjecture very little about it he must go	 3.0222134033623815
him so think it no harm to be off you need not send them word at	 2.935263387475365
my dear sir replied mr collins i am particularly obliged to you	 2.749124900649067
miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and	 3.0152231212561817
fall into it no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have	 2.526475935314326
will you do me the honour of reading that letterand then with a	 2.517264677129425
she had not happened to see mr joness shop boy in the street who had	 4.312719188597282
such premeditation and her intreaty that she would not give into it	 4.080351242970568
owner but surely said she i may enter his county with impunity	 4.279291372005436
under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof	 3.042271234029636
delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of	 3.5542019180842512
passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too	 3.225714474762814
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingleys good	 4.342603375077734
chapter xix	 1.924954712018208
mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has	 2.4684671396257163
partiality when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my	 3.199863557665257
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs bennets ill humour or ill	 2.6699228150166827
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the	 2.4679528641944684
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his	 4.234969612052937
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself since her	 3.115923276300042
wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing	 3.1484215616886337
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister and	 2.777580812016687

morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her	 3.1165982018505574
introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an	 2.4965897064393494
he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes and	 3.308246477981198
can you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going	 2.699430836263738
she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and	 2.748142068310385
with the rest of the party she now lost every expectation of pleasure	 2.6299567145934883
ill at netherfield	 3.153141958190435
name of your admirer this letter is from mr collins	 3.4052123120706197
as she pronounced these words mr darcy changed colour but the emotion	 3.742511576082729
your father was still with him but would quit town the next	 2.435136202306739
the whole party jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and	 3.043351351479882
at their acquaintance with spirit	 3.0332291221891796
almost no restrictions whatsoever you may copy it give it away or	 2.4619434935737066
at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about	 2.7000236612859925
are you thinking are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted	 3.109628249300724
and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to	 3.4516670053249263
do we	 3.2650855329589388
should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of	 3.9208613104980876
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that	 2.7706573502223835
finished her speech of what are you talking	 2.6084852310166373
disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to	 3.3331044976809454
kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe	 3.0552649659542586
complacency when thus accosted by miss bingley	 2.5577268978475223
unjust accusations accompanying her rejection he who she had been	 3.4630720074111907
is to spend an evening in this way i declare after all there is no	 2.6815345304212075
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his	 3.0201173318128096
being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and mrs	 3.5605708715752207
hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report for what do we	 3.2483463367050147
the country	 3.3235009448589445
imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must	 2.6501291097513935
acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming	 3.0727174332923273
of discourse proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the	 2.9480327388606593
yourself and with a low bow he left her to attack mr darcy whose	 4.398005528238285
were neither formal nor falsely adorned elizabeth was delighted she	 3.02387933028708
discouraged from speaking again and mr darcys contempt seemed	 2.436935439836041
instituted by the church of england as a clergyman moreover i	 4.734419149955775
you dare	 3.3836427901383086
she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on	 3.5778105940152423
about mr robinson	 3.19449767835043
scotland	 2.0190770273117145
if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone	 2.265528817743951
inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her every time	 2.7395444413648393
mr fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud illnatured	 2.5471038444668856
she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of	 3.98960707162668
in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make	 2.511006421466154
catherine said she you have given me a treasure are any of your	 2.530512885071518
oh certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really	 3.1495672517861455
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory she was now	 3.7056116542813533
or cause to occur a distribution of this or any project gutenbergtm	 3.5341296609590565
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood	 2.666041189603343
nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the	 2.451184238507059
that is very true said elizabeth though it had not occurred to me	 2.635498569175697
well over the agitations of former partiality entirely so she had even	 3.07082880328649
being given on such a point without being resented	 2.763277435334452
an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to	 2.62644904232778
all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but little of their spirit	 2.6585359590966875
befall her	 2.80626952168695
perhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought an	 2.72106256032471
that you were gone into the army and she was afraid hadnot turned	 3.969728060947334
wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt	 2.7803439866740045
and nothing to reproach him with thank god i have not that pain a	 3.538549252271413
them smiles decked the face of mrs bennet as the carriage drove up to	 3.416859142586794
yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of	 2.811590351184553
explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give	 4.472454864639776
it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself	 2.7749183300870235
carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on	 3.5084120601784488
i confess said he that i should not have been at all surprised by	 3.0939506639428886
aunt it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he	 2.654678229677957
this is a parade cried he which does one good it gives such an	 2.562625376516201
i am not	 3.075154690158499
in the world and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have	 2.614567874207657
should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to	 2.2456518482185386
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time this was	 4.4376746573407635
which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailing she	 3.3672981666370427
father at home on the following day which was saturday rendered	 2.5078604425796254
elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked	 3.2643942014591922
love with only a few days before	 3.3330403282459122
remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself	 3.6896914204753677
let me write for you said jane if you dislike the trouble	 2.328408468631339
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them mr wickham	 2.6863393770826236
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than	 3.6035395970331185
brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at	 2.5512656678489365
think it will be very tolerable besides it will not much signify what	 3.159427312793541
scruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebuke	 2.9721284738971696
opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind one may be continually	 3.16189159572041
and permanent future for project gutenbergtm and future generations	 2.255750542551879
that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins	 4.003391871077479
their visit to rosings mr collins was carefully instructing them in	 3.819003537357107
much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be	 2.9842147859463877
and down they ran into the diningroom which fronted the lane in quest	 4.062410797684288
they had been speaking mr bingley and his sisters came to give their	 2.7262637374270384
wonder i am truly glad dearest lizzy that you have been spared	 3.375964001028442
i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy	 3.460297613143286
his conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with many	 4.416078002903648
quarter of an hour	 3.3309437634805015
we are not in a way to know what mr bingley likes said her mother	 3.115302437172996
when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which	 2.820515630838461
they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to	 3.3263532251307364
lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey	 2.341003196455126
young cousin no ill will and should never resent her behaviour as any	 2.265730805209154
advantageous by you i was properly humbled i came to you without a	 3.8433161947203525
we will go round the park every day i am the happiest creature in	 2.418606478737877
something for fortune and figure	 2.91640650674008
in parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer	 4.02856636394641
you keep winking at me for what am i to do	 2.4015103268593894
asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as	 3.549648913363345
oh thoughtless thoughtless lydia cried elizabeth when she had	 2.6329362922640076
i beg you would not put it into lizzys head to be vexed by his	 3.005751553463372
will easily comprehend from these particulars that mr wickhams	 2.3696495678142995
restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a	 3.380220377764506
be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find	 3.133104315467497
she did not like to go home again so soon she added	 2.6402901375563537
received at first an absolute negative but jane and elizabeth who	 4.055146847616437
themselveswe have tried two or three subjects already without	 2.5995714236002705
come here my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room	 2.6912853705384854
speed through the neighbourhood it was borne in the latter with decent	 4.079206675635441
i must ask whether you were surprised said elizabeth	 2.3579202791871503
cousins conduct does not suit my feelings why was he to be the judge	 2.814162495956413
be so beautiful for nothing i remember as soon as ever i saw him when	 2.546521658674178
farthing less than ten thousand pounds i should be sorry to think so	 2.758631877890682
her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with	 2.9878748105558928
i know are all chance in this world there is no knowing how estates	 2.340140344225983
all intercourse was at an end but at length by elizabeths persuasion	 2.838332786538758
catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves	 2.5880511274768843
from netherfield and was opened immediately the envelope contained a	 3.3602847533328855
such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice	 3.452471073318301
he is indeedbut considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we	 3.118143243835626
help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a	 2.8193092197252123
looking at the picture it is a handsome face but lizzy you can tell	 2.720977614993868
told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter	 2.5197834766629943
clothes when i get to longbourn but i wish you would tell sally	 2.5959753352875667
its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means	 3.258531783206372
could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her	 3.149960047049515
chapter xiv	 1.924954712018208
proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering	 2.5258383886852087
mrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no	 2.7521774811617807
fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as	 2.462899937708129
longbournhouse elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all sense	 3.326446245299286
doing very well together your tempers are by no means unlike you are	 2.719828595824286
whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to	 2.187990281269416
another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to	 3.974066042270278
swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance its banks	 2.618368823292685
great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly	 3.1980823612176055
accomplishedshe plays and sings all day long in the next room is a	 2.8689185349326185
marriage my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of	 2.5178523550393574
propriety not a pleasure to himself he seldom appeared really	 2.487830113786744
got pretty near the truth she directly replied	 2.359310680005099
presumption to aspire can never take place no never mr darcy is	 2.589917731035798
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was	 3.4323036634852606
how could i ever think her like her nephew said she as she looked in	 2.3298822071008654
money no connections nothing that can tempt him toshe is lost for	 2.588980532206011
so long in one attitude	 3.1526873732017955
affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence	 2.2447190982135754
little copse	 3.0646361866646386
your examination of mr darcy is over i presume said miss	 3.824631961297598
either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from	 2.7241998057609953
terms with any one with whom it had always pleased him to be at	 2.8935869429810674
the badbelongs to you alone and so you like this mans sisters too	 2.7306372845025764
colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of	 2.456526494361101
before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if mr bingley	 3.2252025307418015
if not by himself such a hope was cherished the letter was to this	 2.8153431843505965
most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the	 3.8148388947652223
assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were	 3.2388140158185577
that his manners are thus softened my reproofs at hunsford could not	 2.6893135152554466
estate and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility and	 2.608531728515769
i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age	 2.9572745784587173
the inns in barnet and hatfield but without any success no such	 4.023295084100375
you look as if you did not care about me	 2.6360343725592204
after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every	 3.337885456678885
they could be of use to us	 3.1545918794171075
in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy she follows him to	 3.768541130236149
country neighbourhood i assure you there is quite as much of that	 2.776054864082339
restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield she	 2.6276905766040795
which do you mean and turning round he looked for a moment at	 2.6061879357740882
own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to	 2.814700702266031
than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring	 2.8945151088146877
he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it	 2.498292362251599
consider how important every moment is in such a case	 2.667634535979189
lydia was exceedingly fond of him he was her dear wickham on every	 2.3721298720213397
might strike them that they could be more economically though less	 3.2371857802990203
else gave way before the hope of janes being in the fairest way for	 3.0638317074986587
well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much	 2.7723087361532897
left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in	 2.7369049024105276
for any thing more lady catherine will not think the worse of you for	 2.5349805140303263
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentlemans	 2.4219607883627186
with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her	 4.431810703222269
pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to	 2.469064058097526
contrary he was all attention to every body by nature inoffensive	 2.4842819211991216
interest in him	 3.1651149548525344
your coming to longbourn to see me and my family said elizabeth	 2.721779881344082
me in every respect	 3.1486703180350135
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence	 3.264104375649257
youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of	 3.459453474238968
her uncle your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him	 2.500107393065706
at least it shews that she was serious in the object of her journey	 3.373066905241517
reflection and she sat in misery till mr darcy appeared again when	 2.420394548589437
them	 3.082473294830494
but only because her husbands regiment happens to be so far off if	 2.905449265735279
not pronounce she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his	 3.1720789068001967
reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon	 3.0131236510180996
fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that	 2.467113869746899
though he was now established only as a tenant miss bingley was by no	 3.6327451627149077
it was evident that he was very much in love with her they saw much to	 3.111432707523624
1e8 you may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing	 2.913864476095411
assistance would be every thing in the world he will immediately	 2.8737977042280853
them	 3.082473294830494
they came the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive	 3.330357490746038
when the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to elizabeth	 3.718666502662517
had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have	 2.7262846848455027
decorums which other people may observe if she does not object to it	 2.6928407595566903
thing more is determined on yours c	 2.4034502024002222
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her	 2.5463460186888844
deserve	 2.0190770273117145
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel many of my acquaintance are	 3.4746428332609502
but mrs bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the	 2.826624913237025
entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some	 3.2996520904765414
in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to mrs	 4.277862825348354
sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon	 2.9078891271003577
husband any satisfactory description of mr bingley they attacked him	 3.944629524024577
her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally	 2.6081351611618553
with great energybut it is a subject which always makes a lady	 3.436650032046594
my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission	 2.5675078651339605
better	 3.7883295794687624
gallantry from the idea it suggested of something moreit now first	 2.603126111395132
i do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of	 3.093253187557823
never been a favourite with them mr and mrs gardiner could not but be	 2.73080632113574
and all the articles of plate which mr collins had promised and as he	 3.7942596652347977
he meant i believe replied jane to go to epsom the place where	 3.317270928612627
never seen the view	 2.9337423431999334
you are too hasty sir she cried you forget that i have made no	 2.530889065124951
if it is designedly done they cannot be justified but i have no idea	 3.7231593567804393
being at home again in a day or two jane was already so much recovered	 2.4408327110949446
absent but had not courage for it at length however the question was	 2.3593717883724006
not and we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was	 3.312094726254902
indeed	 3.7325457526237207
staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it	 4.117270063505931
happiest wisest most reasonable end	 2.643100393617832
it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now	 3.5283650317680455
way that would induce you to accept me	 3.36857483028883

that is a question which i hardly know how to answer we all love to	 2.3856234052961613
oh if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in	 2.591162127261595
impossible mr bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him	 2.971082190125394
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr	 4.0331665186697085
comfort was that mr bingley must be down again in the summer	 2.611151260000459
into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on	 3.3741126984282417
disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town and	 3.3137834470820478
housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all mr bingley	 2.5549808205705156
but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of	 5.09484416258155

oh no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so	 2.1642670334445833
be not so let mr darcy contradict it besides there was truth in his	 2.419717107173293

the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not	 2.678189045795678
politeness by the whole family mr bennet indeed said little but the	 2.4920997487122363
quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas	 2.8277402022548883
interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would	 2.776261166662995
her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me if your	 3.8984013295881956

and looked and spoke with the same goodhumoured ease that he had ever	 3.106766462035395
and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy	 3.805197737569841
ten thousand pounds heaven forbid how is half such a sum to be	 3.237149446721
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to	 2.4892877298101586
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however	 4.564759610913864
was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she	 3.2776570587533294
continued	 3.7867118491708895

the world perhaps other people have said so before but not one	 2.289883974120678
to the late mr darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the	 2.9262194010109144
prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute	 2.519438365103059
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner you had much better	 2.5641087461648224
may be offensive to yours i can only say that i am sorrythe	 3.3526294182741085
girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is	 2.7814681565400847
no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her	 2.9136747736181428
did not you think mr darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well	 2.6611636724538372
it is not mr bingley said her husband it is a person whom i	 2.9012081762146398
coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again	 3.747511653406538
elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though	 2.605646102711707
quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr darcy	 3.0973154374631724
hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded for	 3.8892693632304525
london georgianas reception of them was very civil but attended with	 3.253396164703088
my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly	 2.4332445707472523
great pleasure in the power of choice i do not know any body who seems	 2.9590452913761656
regard	 3.8655141794946193
figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own	 2.879307569321764
produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched	 3.9023195784161464
way and after a moments pause added	 2.7438062261216842
ramsgate last summer i made a point of her having two men servants go	 2.344080628484984
any silly cause i was only confused for the moment because i felt	 2.917779084626385
immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour but	 2.6915112940979196
and all was soon right again	 2.6389433793022445
and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without	 3.2949146592581515
sure will not hear of her removal	 3.0513670278312928
present and prepare for another disappointment her tour to the lakes	 3.3344343033413257
to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and	 2.9729079491001578
the most agreeable man i ever sawand if he becomes really attached to	 2.953334651865533
and of this place thought she i might have been mistress with	 3.1061359323373887
when this information was given and they had all taken their seats mr	 2.3347895270613606
so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george	 2.502705982498527
in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the	 2.8759645061674948
longbourn the children two girls of six and eight years old and two	 3.226586222976378
i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were	 2.462460474439986
kitty did she very innocently said what is the matter mamma what do	 2.742772520518035
the latter with regard to new furniture	 2.812489774014062
beyond a walk with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten	 2.8998958726092012
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an	 3.3093668617071605
but of this answer lydia heard not a word she seldom listened to any	 2.3312833288348167
end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by	 2.5154061223258735
he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of	 3.010979848924229
in the room	 3.161476076768199
elizabeths collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and	 2.9762431236072637
work or any other work associated with project gutenbergtm	 2.6590185084051137
and this is your real opinion this is your final resolve very well i	 3.044945227548052
trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so well	 3.1506645843694963
my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the	 2.9524417567217562
them ill	 3.3408896442392373
bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of	 2.8214050853688675
own future property the dinner too in its turn was highly admired and	 2.189714424940667
i am astonished my dear said mrs bennet that you should be so	 3.118915417742933
overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the	 3.476053192660995
in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence elizabeth made no	 2.6428902396002205
messages to his sister mr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet and	 2.9795485156519783
find however that colonel f is not disposed to depend upon their	 2.5493361858443997
certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with	 2.1693251181365194
the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice	 4.109964881862002
it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not	 2.547611501981823
it ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many	 2.667096956001337
i do not recollect that we did	 3.1665696395731513
spirits increased she longed to see mrs philips the lucases and all	 4.219404920603798
assemblies and that mrs long has promised to introduce him	 2.970625575628812
merely to the illustration of your character said she endeavouring	 3.6349150124195884
hearing the very best performers on miss lucass persevering however	 2.589214419142524
acquaintance an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much	 2.6908361658817266
thing and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two	 3.7387755840446975
miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though	 4.013758806177699
collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only	 2.43850626077857

amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to	 2.3901352786811527
months of having another daughter married to mr collins she thought	 2.7997890692020126
coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible	 3.6894813051280164
at her sister and bingley shall take place what congratulations will	 2.7084016025924806

then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your	 2.5687024303766823
she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will	 3.587114359285685

ayebecause she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he	 2.3782426831661923
who have been kept aloof by lydias folly	 2.7700264364770617
to mr and mrs gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage	 2.5443306536024903
not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small	 3.7313009681102285
i began to be afraid you would never come back again people did say	 2.3661927506347706
you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me	 3.8002116941751933
had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful	 2.213163041873668
it at all advisable after sitting a little while with jane on miss	 2.681691921702608
yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot come	 2.08908387327344
at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never	 3.387412406890629
next morning to london	 3.1128548414890242
of what might be called economy in her own private expences she	 3.4686320118661045
her nieces beginning the subject	 2.7124017741721493
for being so silly	 3.1633900730386464
her companions when is your turn to come you will hardly bear to be	 2.4985675454694842
reflections as must make her unfit for conversation	 3.280688662838987
at length the chaise arrived the trunks were fastened on the parcels	 3.0632896178876696

boy	 2.0190770273117145
saturday and to saturday he still meant to stay	 2.4219161112087577
they were joined by mr collins who entered with an air more stately	 2.605993757019077
she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out she	 2.945163874024645
so totally independent of every one	 4.578660300843138
with a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing	 3.2042351626135575
thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on	 2.3892288420248726
of his father	 3.16801281678498
unless a copyright notice is included thus we do not necessarily	 2.54159821341493

them from mr darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to	 3.496249505445493
he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his	 2.8641299150878496
what he really is sometime hence it will be all found out and then we	 3.212850502854549
as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided	 2.9343330362562017
seen him so pleasant as this morning	 2.7724697029571868
a day or two since we first cameand yet how many things have	 2.255446079335545

mr bingley and under your orders	 2.8300344132646513
miss bingley i think i have heard you say that you know them	 2.8413506954594374
to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any	 2.59866709801455
hopes of mr bingleys heart were entertained	 2.882794786469021

tears in her eyes that a sisters sense of decency and virtue in such	 3.581351207359445
interval of waiting appeared very long it was over at last however the	 2.3829459714492116
happiness no no let me shift for myself and perhaps if i have very	 2.6507454113413256
i never saw such a woman i never saw such capacity and taste and	 2.7434147783729483
will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt	 2.5028147024699443

should be in some danger	 3.086683513412312
but that is nothing to us you know sister we agreed long ago never to	 2.3626978850515155
all the unhappiness she had brought on her family if she heard me	 3.3142967723197136
pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have	 2.5939808576926118
exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i	 2.9939639218208085

with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers it was	 4.5203588667118835
my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for	 2.6252096268172345
but allow that mr bingley when questioned by jane had long ago	 3.0217751170936755
dear maam do not goi beg you will not gomr collins must excuse	 3.4494402741492154

miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards got up and walked about	 2.585884317415618
way that maria thought herself obliged on her return to undo all the	 2.334276522093326

he is gone i never saw such a long chin in my life well but now for	 2.7847253256920537
good heaven can it be really so yet now i must believe you cried	 2.227311199261354
darcys using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he	 2.7344205965434716
invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he	 2.7341623065066987
nor can i find there was any intention of being so but if you are	 2.6549275844355615

much entailed as ever the lucases are very artful people indeed	 3.183931996496322
she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far	 3.368603533610503

her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without	 2.3721926085666896
could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easiness	 2.3648213360116723

love and the object of that love her friend eliza she sat herself	 2.403755956237061
due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which	 2.491631181035486
civil for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well	 2.6294251248410254
with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her	 2.5038296299247715
see her either at longbourn or netherfield and embracing her most	 2.810294836096903
i am grieved indeed cried darcy grievedshocked but is it	 2.6741938184583267
great comfort to them in their hours of freedom their other aunt also	 2.5310600385917095
bingley was the person meant it was all conjecture	 2.8927030283984774

mr collins	 3.112248978757585
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away	 3.1623964200197205
thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect too	 2.2344900402644288
the day passed much as the day before had done mrs hurst and miss	 2.6851443675547713
pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more	 3.3931576302279214

which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open	 2.6300499617125657
deserving her mothers reproach prevented his feeling any regret	 2.5685259427966405
poor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his	 3.0486383101697356
neighbours might all see mr bingley in consequence of it before they	 2.57937482060186

i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which	 3.00244453965054

this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of	 2.48175441648342
receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that	 2.332301804984032
letter remained on her mind she was all surpriseall astonishment that	 2.5744204414792624

jane oh lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed	 2.3615242096838247
wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with	 2.8270152736239607

your humility mr bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof	 3.09722762457525
it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to	 3.419648314869148
been for her own perverseness he made her an offer in this very room	 2.572084268230504
it was my brother gardiners drawing up too and i wonder how he came to	 2.3586830499820506
humour and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn everything wore	 3.639837036155395
miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to	 2.7347909203740572
paid him but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own	 2.8819253401759872
in spite of her deeplyrooted dislike she could not be insensible to	 4.150474743680169
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this	 3.4866519289803315
wishing expecting my addresses	 3.3017903893246823
they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while	 4.883339492255403
proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his	 2.30165467142257
former lover when first he came in he had spoken to her but little	 2.3786404861878045

dare say very agreeable do let me ask my partner to introduce you	 2.4953840058749233
could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickhams name	 2.962443002926583
mother went forward to meet her but instead of the expected summons	 2.3707101385265705
charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling but no	 2.413809508958818
their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and	 2.1973520792387213
and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could she counted	 3.2740735330080812
worse she had need to be thankful she felt it so and though in	 3.279092876021428

late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep and	 3.662489497869106
society and from our connection with rosings the frequent means of	 2.278341241218151
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she	 2.660774185974491

but they are not i hope of understanding my temper i dare not vouch	 2.620352551037728
thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour and	 2.9823731043391724
make the most of it	 3.029038678389587
dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way but	 3.1305127771947436
and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings	 2.7015050833206
his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming	 2.756496801950175
integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of mr	 4.0888365122829775
could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there	 3.1936700596722676

being soon married her joy burst forth and every following sentence	 2.198945197009974
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday senight	 2.6337684125216305
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related they were natural and just	 2.168536763653894
to play and sing before any body and every bodyif my vanity had taken	 2.625730428577637
delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you	 2.436577229760271
elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those	 3.004225071454302
night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she	 2.5072861082835
of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express	 2.468852642584318
contents i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink	 2.936732006260852
could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other	 3.0006272594713366
the carriage drove off	 3.064806793283137
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her the certainty of	 2.851131948190985
moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it a report of a most	 2.8242476731940407
why should we	 3.081980123758655
mr gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from	 2.4027252324080535
her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of	 3.36735388977512
catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but lydia with perfect	 3.2453047345174024
well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what	 2.728836572700955
mrs gardiner then rallied her niece on wickhams desertion and	 2.5756620140984117
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any	 2.6440976716095017
so much the better it cannot be done too much and when i next write	 2.447135528212078
incomprehensible but now it was all too natural for such an attachment	 2.6108361034860477
inferior to what elizabeth felt	 2.934649728501405
i certainly shall not you know how i detest it unless i am	 2.556803693970435
distraction of his thoughts	 3.2566383119147075
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of	 2.967971424290848
and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a	 2.8831107336414172
purport of his letter was to inform them that mr wickham had resolved	 3.7593197142146977

liable to you for actual direct indirect consequential punitive or	 3.9809194863935917
slightest suspicion i told him moreover that i believed myself	 3.517268783519318
he must be an oddity i think said she i cannot make him	 3.4266084306447344
with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance	 3.851595265040012
i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet	 2.6784830847085273
nor i i am sure said miss bingley	 3.2242925113671035
darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right you have employed your	 2.8255019553915446

he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity	 2.846344850483301
afterwards visited mrs bingley and talked of mrs darcy may be guessed	 2.4794962196326744
sisters wedding it was exactly a scene and exactly among people	 2.185826268979929
nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of	 3.032594755986262

did not know the whole story before the end of the day	 3.4446477376607763
an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it	 2.9196703691968096
yours ever	 3.313286234452271
up with her but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody	 2.709599046955234

perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson did not	 2.906434305809369
collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge the reason of this sudden	 2.670432376561868
on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing	 2.7397771563797706
much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing	 2.6010262145305876
that he was asking some odd unconnected questionsabout her pleasure in	 3.977522804369141
and what did she say	 2.7739971561064642
told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to	 3.1608882781580085
tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired	 3.5747511785938624
particularly begged him to do he merely added that he should not write	 3.2996773926347607
and vanity she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle	 3.4586131835807326
are removed of course we hope that you will support the project	 2.99308388987231
being in town i am certain from something she said herself and	 2.598528486042006
fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no	 3.8366551441726093
the british court of its brightest ornament her ladyship seemed pleased	 4.014662969184139
collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much	 3.0863803149996776
miss de bourgh you both did as much as you could in planning the	 2.752033297076441
of mrs jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means and	 2.997188001753487
that your friend has drawn an unfortunatebut on this point it will be	 3.3178284752443727
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with	 2.5818975519384164
as to the management of them all told her how every thing ought to be	 3.1655527719882155
beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point	 2.6898357535446937
that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man	 2.6471171423467412
jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as	 2.7726732973978283

every hour in his esteem	 2.7822888848685787
elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for	 2.699284503201844
an hour after every body else was gone which gave them time to see how	 2.3732211576404363

fixed there by the keenest of all anguish self reproach she could find	 4.77281861631376
there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliams manners	 3.3659325103578364
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste they were	 3.052587982380346
to accompany sir william and his second daughter the improvement of	 2.899673218325682

gone	 3.8695292650518427
without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now	 3.5796175930956733
thought of him and mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by	 3.3762071479460283
little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss	 2.6924579419832297

house lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr	 2.6527147847664705
elizabeth after the health of her family she answered him in the usual	 2.7129207955842847
could flatter herself with such an expectation surprise was the least	 2.777246112288288
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at	 2.204576792218833
folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering	 2.6551196166737205
in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently	 2.7418024881904777
will join me early tomorrow he continued and among them are some	 2.0927798609186157
comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied	 3.025416959601988
consequence as this should ensue you may easily believe was far	 2.5578521220209085
to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is	 2.141443998661807
necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence	 3.0440496963705193

yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both	 3.7984506019601505
scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every	 2.705471778093334
to become of us all the collinses will turn us out before he is cold	 2.7908689190581266

it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty	 2.7980250608046977

another reason too for her opposition she dreaded seeing wickham again	 3.1370540429938623
disagreeable man all to yourself but i hope you will not mind it it is	 2.620949096615063

that respect his friend had greatly the advantage bingley was sure of	 2.4037370736933914
and you can copy and distribute it in the united states without	 2.9752968330782106
he was in town and why not to me if he fears me why come hither if	 2.5290062228838606
attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling	 2.3153878059809934
proud without being vain pride relates more to our opinion of	 2.3022574666143143

about pretty much for my part i am inclined to believe it all mr	 2.919375485752904

you know nothing of the matter that is all to be forgot perhaps i	 3.541295757577396
to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and	 2.5744992863099587

methey were excessively sorry to go but so they always are the dear	 2.4345054380995395
a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and	 2.619523725387519
she was at least free from the offence of mr darcys farther notice	 3.650417889371954
had there renewed a slight acquaintance of his former way of life	 2.448471036797023

in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of	 2.6425756545370667

dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in	 2.360529172800452
honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make	 2.898700079752559

this is a wretched beginning indeed my sole dependence was on you and	 3.380396880623714
freely i can recal nothing worse but the fact is that we are very	 2.7078756397086305
glancing her eye at mr darcy though every glance convinced her of what	 2.5431730065859517

i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they	 2.3514315576232665
the caprice of their inclinations had his own happiness however been	 3.0684903554450473
and he soon afterwards said aloud mr bennet have you no more lanes	 2.7895641685319097
do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an	 2.6037438148417222
as soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was	 3.6373723986678344
without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising	 3.116555876480461
greatest share the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had	 4.225177672211628
indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored	 2.425230672588779
darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth	 2.334280508036469
even elizabeth began to fearnot that bingley was indifferentbut that	 3.5968365974867034
she herself had been barbarously used by them all and on these two	 2.910626212905414
and was finally settled according to charlottes first sketch she was	 2.8898946311970906
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them	 3.7085465104981408
resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity	 2.4576177640881456
the place immediately and mrs younge was of course removed from	 2.9064243505834733
either now seriously what have you ever known of selfdenial and	 2.5341696884703384
between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr philipss	 2.570281551320449
temper her heart was not likely to be easily touchedthat i was	 2.871798364212093
me would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it	 2.955993857257043
when he looked at her she stood several minutes before the picture in	 2.6379439256064097
confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running up	 2.8282226986137973
mrs gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found	 3.729514490274335
purpose to inquire after her mr darcy corroborated it with a bow and	 3.848489025460329
distribution of project gutenbergtm works	 2.801286969771387
when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very	 2.5832012033003786
goodnatured when children are goodnatured when they grow up and he	 2.882389676626556
over he naturally returned to all his former indolence his letter was	 2.723578978495844
obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility	 2.687031582037642
respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of	 2.7134835606495806
pride and prejudice	 2.570661158107772
and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry did he know of	 2.2208348333470362
shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information	 3.033801353365055
that he was so well convinced of lady catherines discernment as to be	 3.2944946873171634
aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if	 3.6158610521044836
would come in the evening this was agreed to and mrs philips	 2.771498501681697
elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol	 3.463501480977153
actually with them if such goodness does not make her miserable now	 2.9031010771937
with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherines	 2.3331053537071953
myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both	 2.596010136881204
elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such	 3.225098433050498
who i believe will soon become a part of the family	 3.0015270519578854
lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat	 3.0321102031260763
former residence and where she had lately learned that some	 2.8303175068178077
and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement	 2.6426800734945854
altogether mr bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and	 2.417709729644188
occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to	 3.8632583741878945
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down	 2.234950499397974
in return by sitting down to whist	 2.703569256960669
think no more about him	 2.8691728906856717
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful	 2.802051568171509
at five oclock the two ladies retired to dress and at half past six	 3.620428368459088
read and had all the masters that were necessary those who chose to be	 2.9701690596799306

beautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collected	 4.754039327432485
attention in the whole course of his life	 2.942168002036241
strikingly alteredwhat could it mean that he should even speak to	 2.681360685882434
how despicably have i acted she criedi who have prided myself on	 3.081228528414107
elizabeth made no objectionthe door was then allowed to be shut and	 2.7439712962950717
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and	 4.007366021533577
one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him i could not	 3.3090892035154265
could not exist in the world two men over whom mr darcy could have	 3.0641974526218787
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary	 2.723038374668134
seemed likely the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might	 2.846942341790383

miss bennets mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as	 4.315654941515884

whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would	 2.9549025813353094
she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely	 2.7673858984259994
her niece however did her justice and pitied her	 2.6383899395029777

over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked	 2.793467564751563
hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to be	 2.9769179502919325
cannot escape the acquaintance now	 3.4252743518687345
we have dined nine times at rosings besides drinking tea there	 2.580303480568324

i wish it may	 2.9722255916439098
within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr gardiners	 2.167281109376712
strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so	 3.2703084887598397
the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out	 3.396916990288517
she is grown so brown and coarse louisa and i were agreeing that we	 4.750307343805152
with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all the	 2.328022829858885
lucases i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says	 2.881969644073627
lizzy you must not do so you must not suspect me it mortifies me i	 3.4211914503581946
another young man	 3.1614869645209387
knowing what she did she accepted him he walked away again	 2.72511179516918
what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the	 2.9254735474616
of matrimony in his parish secondly that i am convinced it will add	 4.0529042530582355
must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was	 2.6667536299838077
all miss bingleys witticisms on fine eyes	 2.777952842912425
he turned to his partner and said	 2.8058537328657773
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise i	 2.404876307889466
to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the	 3.6175327331501057
welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to	 2.5003862139737616
most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he	 2.9700971709343684

to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachmans	 3.0485295801484686
ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand	 2.6671526618352903
walk and mr collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker	 2.9987433346156154
catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman for	 2.716778413182365
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady	 2.40679091057749
despising his fellowcreatures in general but did not suspect him of	 3.729171079623335
seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent	 2.3652082185960235

successfully combated by the more natural influence of janes	 2.8784622266707247
lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer	 2.2053718727848928
something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of	 2.53176337987665
it was not till the afternoon when he joined them at tea that	 2.884215800089226

the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding	 3.3567288183335457
him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly	 2.9272271489305113
you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after	 2.6310110910647455
nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne	 4.285228797671621
and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations nor when	 2.9155897459452755
any thing to deserve to lose it i have a warm unguarded temper and i	 3.977878651067066
when we are better acquainted	 3.0772456781280226
then said	 3.352473494567642
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by	 2.9092986519573785
elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for	 2.579372286671298
1e9	 2.0190770273117145
was my confidence was as natural as your suspicion i do not at	 3.2659273698462674
to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to	 3.1256584114908534
himself at her feet he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins	 2.960422778614676
me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance	 2.928310844564563
let me call your maid is there nothing you could take to give you	 2.419836483635549
which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit when mr collins could be	 2.3440392938318504
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was	 2.6486565192089766
she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh and trusting their	 2.8813051109091457
feared w was not a man to be trusted my poor mother is really ill	 3.375007083153072
why did not you all learnyou ought all to have learned the miss	 3.079164876061304
every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give	 2.8583948789448823
very little of his time there in future he has many friends and he is	 2.3359028046359076
subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for	 3.3091908872340463
case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it	 2.422023150188695
attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i	 3.3211077790368155
interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those	 3.1021339712892924
noi feel he may defy us there and as to laughter we will not expose	 2.997005322523835
keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an	 2.8309249792228925
were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with	 2.664218297294569
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy himself but	 2.8204341272556226
and distributed to anyone in the united states without paying any fees	 4.090164308372377
chapter viii	 1.924954712018208
and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage	 2.976092595823604
a favourable answer he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but his	 2.390888166998107
eight the express was sent off directly my dear lizzy they must	 2.3680281247766786
what does mr darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my	 2.7293067377291957
and ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberately	 3.4632730803098557
in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your	 3.041413311066422
shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight	 3.3940494135017656
jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own	 2.6036849510464317
doubted and was silent this he considered sufficient encouragement	 2.505459269248192
high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chuses to be seen	 3.9431443938298223
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched	 5.147631205011548
dependence when have you been prevented by want of money from going	 2.277348274094273
had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as	 2.256738586332816
sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our	 2.9709923939723124
interest in the eyes of his friend mr darcy had at first scarcely	 3.065881628277953
or rather he has not wickhams countenance for his features are	 2.7857473533257324
being acceptable	 3.2561414108376088
appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight their eyes	 2.6945068951250937
miss bennet paused a little and then replied surely there can be no	 2.911011262111767
apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without being	 3.489104042633406
was repeated to colonel f who instantly taking the alarm set off	 2.1873506749907277
i hope you are well miss bennet that lady i suppose is your mother	 2.6740631168090077
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help	 4.055612041537741
well cried elizabeth have it as you choose he shall be	 2.610258090878126
that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me	 3.2592615542989027
overlooked it was gratitudegratitude not merely for having once	 2.8937869898965434
library to myself as soon as may be	 3.3122947958739
against your will against your reason and even against your character	 2.2602723773154927
disengaged he never came near enough to speak she felt it to be the	 2.925636387218652
take us all there for the summer it would be such a delicious scheme	 3.2608542798745432
am strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friends	 2.9778542199794127
despicable	 2.0190770273117145
advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr	 2.1798809323478503
has often said so and envied me janes beauty i do not like to boast	 2.9035879855795628
it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be	 2.557111354592395
in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with her	 2.5471343752072877
resentfully since we are not to visit	 3.075155775851277
approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the	 3.8146327121803068
again over the perverseness of the meeting and his behaviour so	 3.3428250559697297
watchfulness has been effectual and though i should certainly be a more	 3.295927176457002
wickham she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and	 2.4678835306756755
of your sisters countenance and air was such as might have given	 2.6763999718854565
when the gentlemen rose to go away mrs bennet was mindful of her	 3.541123906954437
with regard to lady catherines family is indeed the sort of	 2.4536723568645207
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here	 4.434276851277671
civilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a	 2.679739087725775
less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now	 2.383506405969056
conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from	 2.7077400349200706
i have heard from authority which i thought as good that it was	 2.726456882088338
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings partyi assure	 3.325764818687534
and the kind of halfexpectation which mrs gardiner had formed of	 3.1831404820504687
enough happened in the time good gracious when i went away i am sure	 2.739813061889112
accomplished for her age her performance on the pianoforte is	 3.6381432180104265
did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him	 2.4684596848512927
her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with	 3.4508136659240916
library	 3.7966324147727253
it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this	 2.3855342524462277
but does lydia know nothing of this can she be ignorant of what you	 2.3133560175154337
good gracious cried mrs bennet as she stood at a window the next	 3.1536980818691127
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence	 2.6336863095932292
when he first came into the room in no countenance was attentive	 2.6527951418544795
you shall hear what she says	 2.6603705203829535
repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and	 3.033301198027068
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter	 2.550867345368325
affected when to her utter amazement she saw mr darcy walk into the	 3.5675381639942136
indirect boast	 2.2759724581815157
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it	 2.7543761316670423
mr darcy with a very expressive smile elizabeth for the sake of	 3.135564469782246
bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter	 3.270806189117186
mr bennet treated the matter differently so lizzy said he one day	 2.6943750751451434
complained bitterly of all this to her husband	 3.5956163659467717
so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her	 3.6453244267667895
disposition lizzy i know that you could be neither happy nor	 2.4586472942814592
jane who was the general favourite and whose steady sense and	 2.3239524373349685
forth in this agreement you must obtain permission in writing from	 2.556036535941883
i must find mr gardiner this moment on business that cannot be	 2.2021133091325784
manner observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he	 3.610233975705864
intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a	 2.4643715622116504
of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man	 2.9682096971680596
returning to netherfield again	 2.966662530807912
lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr darcy drawing near	 2.9963574504820905
the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some	 3.090515811776406
which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming	 3.1540478297658505
she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion	 3.1735539715072822
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed	 3.2283545564843825
elizabeths astonishment was beyond expression she stared coloured	 2.932694712830582
the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would	 2.7108628265855623
serviceand perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as	 2.518482509726478
of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition	 2.716832567505646
manner made him start and before he could recover himself enough to	 3.1033100247693035
admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion	 4.369360894522627
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickhamthe	 2.669283661976438
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room she wished she	 2.836781686162167
winter	 3.849316361654259
you may as well call it impertinence at once it was very little less	 2.658812381241831
added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to	 2.605806813227237
and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently there has	 3.1725961608509023
affection you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong and me most	 2.8154624466601033
the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants	 2.460698109792857
preserved	 2.0190770273117145
in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of	 2.5835080886044843
the applicable state law the invalidity or unenforceability of any	 4.381720697791284
lydia was a stout wellgrown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion	 4.298066282136867
the north of england a circumstance more deeply impressed on their	 3.7857837179740286
struck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of	 3.1028241067108224
i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley how can mr bingley	 2.8054990669963886
i cannot do justice to his kindness he meant to provide for me amply	 3.2328048406482734
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the	 2.6933799267151004
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very	 2.8806228238396154
elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and	 3.3300372211028906
but did not live to do itmr bingley intended it likewise and	 2.2736684482645764
manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it	 4.635338359963061
bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him	 3.311573974640718
discover them but he had something to direct his search which was	 3.7929458542649668
alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed	 3.3723157200235225
and down the room in earnest meditation his brow contracted his air	 3.897241971052472
of the officers wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing	 2.810252980816822
forgiveness the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlottes	 2.7791604296917196
before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered	 3.018187840368172
ladies i have more than once observed to lady catherine that her	 2.9164733357453607
la replied kitty it looks just like that man that used to be with	 2.1124027139021333
clothes must reflect on her daughters nuptials than to any sense of	 3.0116957945886926
comes here tomorrow with him	 2.727817427157591
regiment to accompany her to brighton this invaluable friend was a	 3.29362854190328
each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the	 3.445520171985347
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance mrs hurst and	 2.5725026712549317
unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in and i hope my dinners	 2.5687593418921293
other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be	 2.749975284373142
forbearance and though mrs philips as well as her sister stood in	 3.1604649357382257
door and met maria in the landing place who breathless with	 3.195700004918019
compliment must be all for herself her astonishment however was	 2.3458705004426874
all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of	 2.176507946187049
good news from town so i took the liberty of coming to ask	 3.0350529968426145
was rather too early to begin in anticipating the happiness of bingley	 3.4722491577517016
marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere she wrote even	 2.9427757671580923
i was surprised to see darcy in town last month we passed each other	 2.24845562180227
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than	 3.1955483635716027
you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to	 2.3748523339882674
humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at	 2.71919262884868
whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his	 2.9167327566021974
felt a wish of enquiring his countenance voice and manner had	 3.0541655209972265
confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due	 2.9300333529379907
it that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable	 3.6019187854959833
prejudice against every thing he might say she began his account of	 2.322932086877498
nothing particular to say to you lizzy	 3.077349039623409
with an air of distant civility mr collins however was not	 2.3298627923417277
third time i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just	 2.7853434072324026
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant	 3.4564600517814243
doubted not as the most generous of his sex but while he was mortal	 3.753541929523568
till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley	 2.901713210731463
she looked and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with	 2.351837562433319
vanity in useless or blameable distrusthow humiliating is this	 4.378895951580972
heard the good news miss lydia is going to be married and you shall	 2.683988949328334
owing to himself that wickhams worthlessness had not been so well	 3.0563419541752372

purvis lodge the attics are dreadful	 3.804577697797435

electronic work or any part of this electronic work without	 2.6439358598586815
good heaven what is to become of us what are we to do would they	 2.7072382727033077
not yet replied jane but now that my dear uncle is come i hope	 2.3950269913574016
that is a question which mr darcy only can answer	 2.5853148056672657
upon elizabeths seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about	 3.2372057220309847
to escape she added lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing	 3.458037508649618

he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take	 3.0762736788803617

lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy	 2.5095543842218633
being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually giving offence	 2.482338554536752
arrangement of them if his own vanity however did not mislead him	 2.9099321254058403
was not conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to	 2.9263930809399232
the time she had the same story to repeat every day mrs bennets best	 3.5321084829336113
he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight for lady catherine	 2.5048767030588657

him to write to you at all and very hypocritical i hate such false	 3.1769613045329095
in this interference from what she had said of her resolution to	 2.9234705661656983
being so thin and so small there was neither in figure nor face any	 2.6716644777916954

you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings	 2.800188271048588
on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at	 2.64825516467255
know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in	 2.7232065913870276
resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer i pity though i	 3.256031162769216
meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future	 3.87203206640612
but why all this secrecy why any fear of detection why must their	 2.5291468637278474
when they approached her she said to miss bennet i beg your pardon	 3.4691799532689047
from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and	 3.3346643719045983
never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter	 2.9807495515169524
when the card tables were placed he had an opportunity of obliging her	 4.544462182412182
represented	 2.0190770273117145
between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those	 5.298498543200541

such an evil	 3.3779258517030355
spirits oppressively high no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her	 3.9677895383432484

perhaps it would have been better replied her sister but to expose	 2.7639421732236844
miraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of money and rank she	 3.7163193747142316
them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference	 2.620270963811683
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own but	 2.898119059315894

occasion no one was to be put in competition with him he did every	 3.1993517239011657

and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly	 2.9423243423829715
consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her	 2.4092371044193404
she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full	 3.3222751725146633

such a flutter that i am sure i cant write so i will dictate and you	 3.7035650802035853
elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief and the other that	 3.6046799531579445
is this thought elizabeth meant for me and she coloured at the	 2.8492038963799
breeding but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to	 2.907646690644966
country because her sister had a cold her hair so untidy so blowsy	 2.945776779704515
mr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred	 4.618678118945054

discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he	 2.5861394656341714
now i have got some news for you said lydia as they sat down to	 2.43054040727943

courted you therei have saved you the trouble of accounting for it	 3.775691796869411

myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley	 2.52272697454216

he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were and that	 2.434858974581715

recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seen	 3.471088769822221

his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had	 2.5281870421809476

particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening	 3.0590571205056807
mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was	 2.4169226099570276
owe you you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most	 2.8873783758968887
as to be in gracechurchstreet by noon as they drove to mr gardiners	 3.7435590665845053
into the drawingroom	 3.387097738270283
certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that	 2.923107564656347
not to hear in a doleful voice mrs bennet thus began the projected	 2.8093503786529337
concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had	 2.578857495039373
bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes	 3.280911453431037
charlottes observation and hurried her away to her room	 3.2609397684302306
her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and	 2.673271287341497
with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held	 3.236379850130009
they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had	 4.149025173589091
she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement	 2.8392416160675094
her a very good sort of girl there can be no love in all this my	 2.7936397833344
to say the truth i was too cross to write you supposed more than	 2.5836294372674367
delayed a little longer and mr collinss proposal accepted with as	 2.774962278372836
visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of	 2.2317063008516773
agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly	 4.021593691463276
she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some ones	 4.160824904203757
spirits and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had	 3.038944116371175
shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill and if i was	 2.5334288615155867
aunt and all mr collinss scruples of leaving mr and mrs bennet for	 2.914617743195373
selfattracted by the rest of her familyand as she considered that	 4.257483529521467
a misfortune to be liked by him mrs long told me last night that he	 2.590082847146903
match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too	 5.518084248290493
she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said	 2.9514914981915754
minutes at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here	 2.338466323481521
backgammon mr bennet accepted the challenge observing that he acted	 2.845050501383735
himself obliged to accept	 2.905406435825856
commendation to think of her as he chose	 3.0312454140849185
elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily	 3.1672472133130802
yes to the last but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what	 2.8288780886055336
and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and	 2.6422260098983466
wholly unexpected i had not an idea of it	 3.1627453740244285
elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend he	 3.1136795296499797
take whatever you like and get away	 2.5289663970881464
reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time	 3.2395482343559485
our own vanity that deceives us women fancy admiration means more than	 2.1551901254216674
their mother mr collinss letter had done away much of her illwill	 2.5193621197899527
therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to	 2.6457146228402766
he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to any	 2.3379042714727345
continue at least a twelvemonth	 2.912140276671866
understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference	 3.4442596121950126
and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the	 2.3690177433721584
back a supply of clothes	 4.002356259620068
professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable	 3.0201334271573907
comprehends every virtue	 3.4549859747453033
his uncle lord and to the great surprise of all the party when	 2.6919627038133465
conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim	 4.2753912449007325
gutenbergtm trademark and any other party distributing a project	 2.7300641743280156
you are over scrupulous surely i dare say mr bingley will be very	 3.081987511440392
took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest	 2.7797334247304857
of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far	 2.958559427363016
hall the diningroom and all its furniture were examined and praised	 4.336824723512961
little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she	 3.2721723133947216
the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she	 3.4508567410319646
laugh at them whenever i canbut these i suppose are precisely what	 2.3100605509010315
thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his	 3.6736594664591284
i see no occasion for that you and the girls may go or you may send	 2.3392475023772694
as well as greater certainty absence had increased her desire of seeing	 2.7408367041921724
this accounted to elizabeth for mr wickhams being among them	 2.760128888098311
when tea was over mr hurst reminded his sisterinlaw of the	 3.2324280262908984
them both the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were	 2.448817836850934
you	 3.2572231825844487
possessed of bringing on the renewal of his addresses	 3.40084175655999
truth oh that i knew how it was	 2.8831132286876087
sisters i should not care how proud i was i would keep a pack of	 2.5485070136491026
particular allowing for the common demands of the game mr wickham was	 4.648786887532299
been unable to give him a gentlemans education my father was not	 3.4961417708358846
satisfy after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel	 3.3313007847529614
handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks	 3.3159034319808187
may never do more than like her if she does not help him on	 2.4680693880634093
objections and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his	 2.3277823132620945
to pemberley therefore they were to go	 2.991498460309552
enquiries which she very early received from mr bingley by a housemaid	 2.616116616128172
pleasure	 3.4247262444767004
affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing	 3.0692292961260828
what can be the meaning of this said charlotte as soon as he was	 2.796807709151578
which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without	 2.5178391957317454
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be	 4.300720170052441
should have been a great proficient and so would anne if her health	 3.5153779710473003

vol iii	 2.2759724581815157
arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of	 2.6598304236871146
of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness	 2.635767074943262

contain herself as soon as jane had read mr gardiners hope of lydias	 2.763928017948606
in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an	 2.4924614770123603
bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydias	 3.0383878732094347
was due to seniority and for the first evening she was his settled	 3.173266661076086
this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently	 3.240932652483396
father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their	 2.431747506828046
oh my dear continued mrs bennet i am quite delighted with him he	 2.6661920893521427
she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of	 2.6199099032280833
actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her he never	 2.378161521117442
recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of	 4.589202278162501
i am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me so before if i	 2.545146290090178
this web site includes information about project gutenbergtm	 3.9641899678034966
next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and	 2.7214734570652412
sake of discovering them	 3.0615997278951417
has very much at heart	 2.823114365587913
that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more	 3.62148603577263
no indeed i did noti knew nothing at all of lady catherines	 2.7543570918868494
me to unfold to any human being having said thus much i feel no	 2.984635520225769
niece should be married from this house of which i hope you will	 2.4583425980735547
nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter	 3.000796762417441
i ought what i dared to do but i knew noti was afraid of doing too	 2.4484433801755334
discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that	 3.0913804497601323
friendly and obliging it was mr collinss picture of hunsford and	 2.988871172430081
cheering and heartening them up though as she never came without	 2.5529759642675725
in general are not more like her does she live near you sir	 2.13513968799279
unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils	 2.6502861976547893
much handsomer than mr bingley and he was looked at with great	 3.2467243578994136
to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must soon	 2.562696761690486
opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me that she could	 3.1727645854136104
them so faithfully what will wickham say it was to be such a secret	 3.101101418478612
hand to both	 3.1143936112127952
such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to	 2.3663170803880265
suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables	 2.371479908602891
repeating it elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her	 2.8433569605650666
these are home questionsand perhaps i cannot say that i have	 2.8140588122694794
letter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediately	 2.5136533299153454
given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a good	 3.321800481593224
than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs when they	 2.56189170933384
eliza bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on her is	 3.237248019242056
guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the	 2.688979323367447
congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever	 3.8865085816624156
while she staid with us if i had not perceived by janes letter	 3.072929246166687
william is mr bingleyis not he so much the man of fashion so	 2.7849312365313446
extreme she did not fear her fathers opposition but he was going to	 3.19872032201613
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give	 2.747409111443377
and younger children would by that means be provided for five daughters	 2.413433853281774
opinion of hertheir opinion of every bodywould always coincide	 2.98971824435574
before it beginsbut as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and	 2.6533056487736335
her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind	 2.5509174976745435
in a shop window could recal them	 3.4979305671927077
expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence	 2.500552221081344
representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and	 3.9977835012038505
peculiarities has abilities which mr darcy himself need not disdain	 3.0010046891850126
called on us in this familiar way	 3.097172418781631
consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every	 3.173552450454946
civility i am thus rejected but it is of small importance	 3.0101499005778214

1e unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg	 2.41543696948039
at the parsonage more than once during the time but mr darcy they had	 2.516402549431188
happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a	 3.3189916051530153
argument and want to silence this	 2.4976750885670884
palatable to you as it seems to be at present that you actually	 2.977742560311445
how long has she been such a favouriteand pray when am i to wish you	 2.79350514755079
entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced her	 2.683139173094853
chapter xii	 1.924954712018208
was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to	 2.9501620070527306
before you came back jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare	 2.4073716422396743
that mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival but	 3.9892213088536437
than when they last met were plainly expressed she was disappointed	 2.3712737382937163
lady catherine seemed resigned	 2.906056625285437
find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact	 2.890480085607978
what do you mean hill we have heard nothing from town	 2.630669128385884
intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea	 3.941885652166063
i am talking of possibilities charles	 2.899624306267753
agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be	 3.052924882921536
fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind	 2.6888318755823843
to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had	 2.8005125229030527
to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea	 2.2964383643930804
saying	 3.8252278843630814
him to act as he has done but if you are really innocent and	 3.835227927947006
to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this	 2.942559138578807
work of the morning and pack her trunk afresh	 3.9202990324025313
longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved	 3.2171124293187687
opened by a servant and mr darcy appeared her pale face and impetuous	 2.5368058699141534
her with his best respects to all her family not forgetting his thanks	 2.954093201823394
might not unreasonably have alarmed her she had dressed with more than	 4.179670673679937
concerned till this moment i never knew myself	 2.434470448793704
and do you impute it to either of those	 3.1069880959836746
i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth but it ought to	 2.328782834717006
he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man	 3.673055679862571
i am not going to run away papa said kitty fretfully if i	 3.1118268757698906
true are the others coming out	 2.6371891707156756
younger boys were to be left under the particular care of their cousin	 2.5108868132614814
your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit	 2.460962220364843
pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased	 2.9072946118692653
for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect	 2.8809239422204134
entering the marriage state	 3.1062531355495224
mile behind	 3.2650594133132014
early attention it is from my cousin mr collins who when i am dead	 2.766101105412437
we attempt to describe any particular scene will we begin quarrelling	 2.7026875688539542
took place with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new	 2.3756437710680416
officers names and connections their lodgings were not long a secret	 2.529905908999306
complied with i am only ashamed of his asking so little	 2.5181609272781014
below with a book mr hurst looked at her with astonishment	 2.7534614372736614
to be learntfor her letters to kitty though rather longer were much	 2.5327646007993163
such splendid expectations he had rather hoped that all his wifes	 3.4499566330449247
little matters	 3.0646361866646386
mrs bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of	 2.476031933519473
prey	 2.0190770273117145
point as well as the still more interesting one of bingleys being	 2.675713103094149
yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and	 3.344959493637502
now kitty you may cough as much as you chuse said mr bennet and	 2.9544658638225627
window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse	 4.95126847496845
exceed their income my dear mr bennet cried his wife what are you	 3.28390876583453
it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had	 3.026042760031148
seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year his	 2.3812033607225858
if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it	 2.4535802770604263
this information however startled mrs bennetshe would have been	 3.136222326115579
was spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr collins joining	 2.8204335298842995
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his	 2.487848432802992
perfect as plan could be	 2.743643328069362
rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from	 2.995071118067227
spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his	 2.739226561906551
greatly in his favour he had all the best part of beauty a fine	 2.5668576355351784
mr gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their	 2.3308852541875544
housekeeping i dare say	 3.324611583103324
bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed	 2.467859317090329
suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter	 2.497466996669252
mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour	 4.553044113875052
for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so	 3.7929009959435893
unappeasable you are very cautious i suppose as to its being	 3.1234845700189973
conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself	 4.559486183803586

wants you in the library she was gone directly	 2.804492856945728
what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and	 3.2080983006220833
little disposed to approve them they were in fact very fine ladies not	 2.839889737118829
did not always love him so well as i do now but in such cases as these	 2.7447401587209774
hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the	 3.028866049896104
of whom does jane ever think ill and who is there whatever might be	 2.21410054439317

lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeths performance mixing	 2.87447655970925
head quarters	 3.4484021949670343
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth	 2.686009487128897

i do not think we were speaking at all sir william could not have	 2.4478956342440417

according to their situation in life when my niece georgiana went to	 2.546061235125181
health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better	 2.7577969704709013

sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how	 2.3882633717321964
that i have never been much in love for had i really experienced that	 2.947325205016128
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr gardiner after	 2.5439930010972467
dining out said mrs bennet that is very unlucky	 3.1064799106120846
such a girl to be my nephews sister is her husband is the son of	 2.3428113368312444

the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits	 3.450078346324473
their premeditated contempt i have therefore made up my mind to tell	 2.195055668067783
with such forbearance and liberality towards him and there are other	 3.8593613613787836
esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met	 2.801903729474791

received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the	 4.238934180850034
expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere	 2.77671547619941
i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a design of	 2.327673270270706

an article of news which then began to be in circulation the	 3.5417678372906574
several times i wonder what he can be doing there	 2.4532013080212725
hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology	 3.709684434977647

interesting object to all my acquaintance were i distractedly in love	 2.810322570410828

freely sharing project gutenbergtm works in compliance with the terms of	 3.9955141381642454
it was a subject which they could not mention before me	 2.7672816656026926
felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you but i	 2.6490048608628167
the park was very large and contained great variety of ground they	 3.129202027825006
be so silly as to wish it your idea of the ponies is delightful	 3.2255480338024523
indeed you are mistaken i have no such injuries to resent it is not	 4.1177831824218325

oh dear yesbut you must own she is very plain lady lucas herself	 2.7906552808849807
dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me	 2.3515019198106484
compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an	 3.595393962919247

that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to	 2.6850582032482477
but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had	 2.9322853954258634
be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt	 2.601536037587737
ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his	 2.5596581406388554
as handsome as any of them mr bingley might like you the best of the	 2.5781335375444954
darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his	 3.4691551024051326
abominable how shall we punish him for such a speech	 2.9269896076102975
believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from	 3.0478875225288977

disagreeable fellows some of them were to dine with the philipses the	 3.2709766832377207
compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been	 2.8405937605099014
willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on	 3.566575394717117
to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickham	 3.0489312219074636
miss bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone you ought to	 2.3529524913231943
words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings and he was	 3.974526316350393

together as to what is to be done	 3.419672013844047
of every bodys character and make it still better and say nothing of	 2.411502123918322
catherine would not come in again and rest herself	 2.4853085507139223
accept the honour of their invitation c mrs bennet was quite	 3.0000788589245664
to be mistress of pemberley might be something	 3.410594994150939

and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity mr collinss present	 4.649456221577865
but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him	 2.403816733546446
how so how can it affect them	 2.699419438732971
herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the	 2.4243300764927302

that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely	 2.7804078760597943

her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana	 3.626444093795623
large party for the ball and a report soon followed that mr bingley	 2.5453536066366267
in speaking of wickham to mr darcy for now they do appear wholly	 2.5123884478841836
to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there	 3.4160810336716887
himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to	 2.8210717257900644
and be careful to write explicitly we have judged it best that my	 3.492456874627781
she had heard and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it	 2.8469373787811807
it must be my uncles doings generous good man i am afraid he has	 3.8501133408602803
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former	 4.042305886720247
well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not	 3.5455486159660934
have thought of my meeting withperhapsa nephew of lady catherine de	 2.5996067266969276
i never saw any one so shocked he could not speak a word for full ten	 2.517415267135936

let the other young ladies have time to exhibit	 2.770610808125947
you as ever	 3.2004978429959716
ourselves intentionally injured we must not expect a lively young man	 2.910615550717738
family	 3.4185096349312105
visited them all and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity	 3.231039759099757
of receipt of the work	 4.996573218674516
first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds	 2.343684081279716
but it is fortunate thought she that i have something to wish for	 2.8759060726134233
she only said in reply with a goodhumoured smile	 3.155803734335526
father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have	 3.3403487625128627

mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and	 2.7996498103794454
i hope my dear said mr bennet to his wife as they were at	 3.1727418266465963
my part except the shops and public places the country is a vast deal	 3.4654334127659627
though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could	 3.3885305027357555
hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of	 3.909343605109238
good conduct i am sure you must not disappoint your father	 3.3900130461026583
could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as much delight	 2.1660022658037463
she answered him with cold civility he sat down for a few moments and	 2.5484244794335993
yes but intricate characters are the most amusing they have at	 3.152355002034328
entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh	 2.686580821179839
flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me	 2.5971390044995215
nothing child nothing i did not wink at you she then sat still five	 2.7166832942178356
comfortably enough there were half hours of pleasant conversation with	 2.3729877632461474
it is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patience	 2.6289080362765556
custom and mary went up stairs to her instrument two obstacles of the	 2.645539273699855

warn me off his grounds	 2.7536878094203137
herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance	 2.3653772166854097
for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as	 3.511139441797105
this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter said	 2.282492452918746

his sister	 3.367419033108429
mrs bennet who quarrelled with no compliments answered most readily	 2.731953639014126
sisters absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of	 2.9131491112127033
revived	 2.0190770273117145
conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will	 2.5686560510728427
wonder why all this was not told you last night but i was not then	 2.775623628859753
indeed i could not i was uncomfortable enough i was very	 3.44229647480713
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement this is not	 4.611928678470621

i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the	 3.2537418305866534
happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never	 2.678721534579412
head and sat down without saying a word elizabeth had mentioned her	 2.4254619990643813
consolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress it	 4.399453305701185
acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen	 2.6749294875894374
elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any	 2.3495974278294343
this was not very consoling to mrs bennet and therefore instead of	 3.607789575703258
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from	 3.7404949214595855
the title of seduction had been extended into every tradesmans family	 3.6628690796975003
him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty you have	 4.614421669455241
satisfaction she had promised herself it was consequently necessary to	 2.86855259340657
so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right	 4.133501530363177
gave way only to the greater distress of mr bingleys continued	 2.7256320722709786
unassuming and gentle elizabeth who had expected to find in her as	 2.8121141886368783
visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he	 2.802201735679922
her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of	 3.321988524635276
the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from	 3.3030043004932805
partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly	 2.312536182309133
went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and	 2.655016278163214

lizzy said he what are you doing are you out of your senses to be	 2.913070562637906

of her feelings on this developement while the contents of the first	 3.4888779907172887

be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most	 3.3117567472606133

was returned in due form miss bennets pleasing manners grew on the	 2.3145611315630594
languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the	 3.368880851198929
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude i was not in a humour to	 2.802816525551663

warranties of merchantability or fitness for any purpose	 3.389785687989579
he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to	 2.6490125422111688

she had condemned and upbraided him her anger was turned against	 3.2970284499482827
her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends	 3.4370831332739544
mention a word about it and so is it quite certain he is coming	 2.4824939672870254
i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of	 2.696257044509251
goodnatured wishes for her welldoing which had proceeded before from	 3.247959509568745
confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary	 3.4652634352968956

that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine	 2.4255572596083255
wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern	 2.946226043264609
inferences however were plainly deduced from the whole one that	 3.487242089200338
i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my	 2.352015703656078

petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him and all the	 3.6788556179669056
that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily	 2.984007063222985
repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister	 2.7411065396347825
well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to	 2.818821892066906

mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother to mr bennets	 2.4454668269925905
your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in	 2.213768622802296
family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her	 2.538865692102878
the utmost to speak with composure when she said	 3.0265686556062614
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body sometimes one	 3.7077070189800887
respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked	 2.9860120516046367
character i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes but he is a	 2.920533271137169

little eager to be alone and fearful of enquiries or hints from her	 3.1588814114214254
successively entered the world but yet the son was to come and mrs	 2.5661999812538703

on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most	 3.3138839676118677
or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others	 2.425280880684047
oh do not repeat what i then said these recollections will not do at	 3.05968647438089
in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away	 2.384023352630882
surprised you could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within	 2.9470890697767995

jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern she knew but little	 2.2304482058952986
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result	 3.2606203421090703
which she might in future be able to dispense	 2.7848749761649025
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the	 3.10377533699755
generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told	 2.6096911514787493
he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising	 3.593908255701841

you are then resolved to have him	 2.5852673005230282
your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned	 2.912810389588614
elizabeth looked surprised the gentleman experienced some change of	 2.35787527409504
hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls though	 2.9187783302538914
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly	 3.1550225225434296

thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be	 4.0587554157284
unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary	 2.5823407270992447

running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back	 2.1903052913677135

mr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickhams removal	 3.36781831736838

she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and	 3.1000603499149832
governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of	 3.372683437232863
bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield	 2.5792295570210495
would not make them one jot less agreeable	 2.545396437533065

extraordinary stretch of belief it was reasonable that he should feel	 2.8288727220041836
encouragement in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew more	 2.855356201445694
chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of	 2.332579412585102
commendations of the lady either on his handwriting or on the evenness	 3.190549806402339
very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone	 3.197890119972964

forwarder than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour ago	 2.5030046246693276
again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home	 2.774586070409237
voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to	 3.3922334739085445
you take an eager interest in that gentlemans concerns said darcy in	 3.122337740414287

to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and	 2.5294681619661867
it it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence	 3.9100885932568423
presumption and besides no traces of them were to be found on the	 3.2380065368402975

mr collins had only to change from jane to elizabethand it was soon	 3.386095623469854
mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth so near	 2.5579084982132536

neglect such an acquaintance well how pleased i am and it is such a	 2.4980796407400714

how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr darcy	 2.667778036088333
authoritative a tone as marked her selfimportance and brought mr	 2.808448831742588
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical	 3.4126338092744057
of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on	 2.778795389085573

she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine after	 2.4886366330312932
circumstancesand he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me	 5.236247695419387
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal	 4.231010764054067
long as it is possiblei know it cannot be long	 3.456827544025329
assertion of her brothers being partial to miss darcy she paid no	 3.144594387217591

produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sisters	 2.676602496885215
what her anxiety for his life had been before	 2.476942098515563
almost no restrictions whatsoever you may copy it give it away or	 2.4619434935737066
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion	 3.174280123611917
way his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her	 3.376643844606893
their journey gave them directions as to the best method of packing	 3.1696830941774405
satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been	 2.5299538197604874
how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions	 2.638988267478684
a creature as ever livedand her nieces are very pretty behaved girls	 2.4559502422735346
mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while	 3.1280389376681472
a wife in view as he meant to chuse one of the daughters if he found	 2.526951017506255

slight inclination of the head she saw that he wanted to engage her on	 2.7958872433682553
gallantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express	 3.7886642562314563
himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation mr hurst	 4.006154210839686
desirous of believing her indifferent is certainbut i will	 2.490081312423808
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through	 4.777720196642103
i am sure i shall break mine said lydia	 2.830074122735589
with such a family and this consideration leads me moreover to	 2.725012872469728
suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the	 4.233888649412221
north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her	 2.5961555820574143
paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected on the	 2.9250461467691404
lasting convenience of that kind but perhaps his sister does as well	 2.6992434596619805
her nieces she shared in their attendance on mrs bennet and was a	 3.2353390504721604
from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was	 2.4408081724863853

compliments to mr and mrs gardiner though unknown he then handed her	 3.0088182824179985

ordered and after some contrivance the whole party with all their	 3.0958846535627167

society of her two friends and the attentions of their brother and	 2.495744705461715

it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added	 2.500271082870704
but she had no reason to fear mr and mrs gardiners curiosity it was	 2.9899813528405472
little and mr hurst nothing at all the former was divided between	 2.9823895607842266

determined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets	 2.5886145903882656
she came into kent again she would be staying there too his words	 2.6907998893694813
mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her	 2.4494116179745

among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the	 3.0983355148949103

time much better no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can	 3.2145520307041684
women better worth their notice let us hope therefore that her being	 2.2750090645327106
to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece	 2.826180864518882
conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the	 2.817129607894787
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw	 2.4964897508336854

even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave	 2.480402778445763

seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at	 2.8890607214476725

to accept them is absolutely impossible my feelings in every respect	 2.339873108060176
hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs bennets civilities	 3.0182106642485245

would perhaps be called resentfulmy good opinion once lost is lost	 2.353511607943046

into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding	 2.229445778327517
looked that way	 3.116703472150856
something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty as	 3.7889843734447517
to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy	 2.8735974813211014
children of his own and may have more how could he spare half ten	 2.746365423653942

you must not blame my aunt lydias thoughtlessness first betrayed to	 2.544212210419596
disapprove of you and you may be certain that when i have the honour of	 3.113282302453978
chapter viii	 1.924954712018208
yes very well i saw them the night before last	 2.5100277996465374
to counterbalance these advantages mr darcy had considerable patronage	 3.3842324145017884
believing what i say i wish you very happy and very rich and by	 2.5462863447865716
his daughters request for such it might be considered of being	 2.4392495352919554
enough to leave her room elizabeth was glad to be taken to her	 2.768124575179316
was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and	 3.2041528963631856
that there was much affection in the case	 3.0123299795601177
illtempered man wickham only shook his head	 2.635033103290044
i have not already heard give me farther particulars what did colonel	 2.216853825087381
her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him	 2.6408565051277018
to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of	 3.627329999738974

experienced many hardships of that nature but in matters of greater	 3.473504957382219
longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard it	 3.4747901875478284
introduce his friend mr wickham who had returned with him the day	 2.6194398554669496
elizabeth that if left wholly to himself janes happiness and his	 2.304983872382638
he hardly knew how to look and they entered the house	 2.687316600615025
took place they must have seen them together for ever	 2.553871588092059
stairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her she opened the	 2.8224997444002566
yes there can for mine is totally differentwill you hear it	 2.997417304198835
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for	 3.701327807100472
temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydias example she	 2.500779155797061
my dear jane make haste and hurry down he is comemr bingley is	 2.680716449535716

and mary king is safe added elizabeth safe from a connection	 3.4217652466813093
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence she was convinced that	 2.490326785753716
there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her	 3.7652037390417887
business never since reading janes second letter had she entertained	 2.34340021051538
valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some	 3.248907911300233

world i love and he is an angel i should never be happy without	 3.104459426247382

your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your	 3.460749930619629
where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has	 2.5460006201861263
triumph the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of	 2.916480413271608
indeed mama you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her	 3.7534970782917574

and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman maam	 2.8199176423227805
home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers there was	 3.676906708268665
i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest	 2.5257533686963
three straws about her who could about such a nasty little freckled	 2.8842408006463445
marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he	 2.432573369193391
intimidate me	 3.2365403435355713

remember eliza that he does not know janes disposition as you do	 2.7528842283030657
and her ideas were nearly worn out before the têteàtête was over on	 3.2411378185396664

miss bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr	 2.579408814424076
kinder than towards myself	 2.822649987287539
she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind	 4.138265254879745
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the	 3.308410422517054

bingley if she could but lizzy oh sister it is very hard to think	 2.5305013731485224
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody	 3.254985196161129

mrs younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was	 3.034299960624953

finer county in england than derbyshire	 3.431805800375172
you i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine i believe nobody	 2.5521235645434204
even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife	 3.569730902136054
lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a	 2.8403209733013646
morning they were therefore to goelizabeth was pleased though	 2.5923686077196404
admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did but	 2.8334526729861893
for her sister and resentment against all the others to carolines	 2.840190962260442
added to its exuberance she was now in an irritation as violent from	 4.0395409961432085
you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of	 2.7374306050808452

their wish of seeing mr and mrs gardiner and miss bennet to dinner	 3.1739663475109463
husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me but	 2.359884350430936
and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into	 2.694136626103744

what has been done for the young people his debts are to be paid	 2.9937775812717606
four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him she endeavoured to	 2.802216490985344
going thither but charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan	 2.9659132662254946
towards him and said	 3.135757265407195
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the	 3.600849116997986
be able to do so lady catherines great attentions to mrs collins you	 2.8789177493801734
instrument is a capital one probably superior toyou shall try it	 2.6832754724373125
and may i ask said elizabeth but the terms i suppose must be	 2.687553392454463
better feeling to worldly advantage charlotte the wife of mr collins	 2.542869131135784
want of attention to other peoples feelings and want of resolution	 2.696770227020245
dont keep coughing so kitty for heavens sake have a little	 2.5866900694701638
but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this	 3.4077753550093015
preference	 2.0190770273117145
conversation with colonel forster	 3.0955965530039076

all i am prodigiously proud of him i defy even sir william lucas	 3.1136429030566575
to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life	 2.8407124939934

i assure you the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw the	 2.5009015093997835

apologising for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with	 3.325112682590303
they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth	 2.8943411480230945
kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry	 2.3574705740471966

short pause followed this speech and mrs hurst began again	 2.42916736575144

fullpursuing her way along the lane she then began it it was dated	 3.385297034766471

this young man will influence her we live in so different a part of	 2.215906319174732
the marriage of her sisters he bore with philosophy the conviction that	 3.510257402612836
contempt it appeared to her merely the suggestion of carolines	 2.889432063503834
this roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being	 2.719973024778545
much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestowhow much of	 2.841407781014256
to that horrid man mr stone and then you know when once they get	 2.7029312516328177
forward and precipitate but i can assure the young ladies that i come	 3.0658022817165547
in such a manner as must be decisive and whose behaviour at least could	 3.217909829980113

the course of jane and elizabeths correspondence with her made her	 3.260106678287408
saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their	 3.1353770745358855

means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you your	 2.297367173568777
person elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though	 2.3068995059296467

a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to	 2.6703348729962593
impression on them elizabeth would not observe her and when at last	 3.3114532956927936
easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an	 2.971054628690256
effect	 3.431395692555523

not before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she sat down	 2.460694089087013
whose eagerness for their cousins appearance would not allow them to	 2.5852106765790297
yesthat is what makes it amusing had they fixed on any other man	 2.817568616517523

humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted	 2.4676203554270075

mr wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the	 2.268093255666613

all worth pleasing so high and so conceited that there was no enduring	 3.132477997161558
have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the	 2.493901231159801
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in	 2.954530882081028
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of	 2.6649885620494107
bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage	 3.057742448725847
it was time to be at home	 2.9082639384189686
gloomy elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it her power	 2.2972337483477454
said he how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to sayyou	 2.8903303646910947
meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they	 2.4288521391973834
i believe him to be lady catherines nephew it will be in my power to	 2.9324885849975604
and i ought to feel it	 3.1548544710447395
so much the better i hope they will not meet at all but does not jane	 2.271681130104692
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied say	 3.3362808866179487
may have drawn him in	 3.654855222940324
person and address that can captivate a woman	 2.9262104011598904
him	 3.277004797264277
very difficult my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to	 3.581970643546985
say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud	 2.245454396233464
but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white	 3.5008489294857137

known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage	 3.5960680204761397
would be insupportable your sisters are engaged and there is not	 3.0461513796295594

mr bennets property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two	 2.403744162873711

doubly engaged on one hand collecting an account of the present	 2.4837868479509058
elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his	 3.6242995430619462
and keeps her room could she exert herself it would be better but	 3.3338512170437427
understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and	 2.91263458101733
consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match i thought it my duty	 3.494449632927904
my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley	 2.1702612043943557
then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike	 5.192477810368509
deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that	 2.724179411498611
his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride	 3.0743846367504712

after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last	 3.4661553178589886
there was a motive within her of good will which could not be	 2.5176341302264427

i do not believe a word of it my dear if he had been so very	 2.9919290672882846
standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and	 3.32157601177173
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink the	 3.3044572926898494

attention you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking	 3.0462187974854644
more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account	 2.710567446370362
it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out	 2.3242605105584677

this was invitation enough	 2.7933809775011618

prevented any public exposure but i wrote to mr wickham who left	 2.9071616641388407
he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each	 3.5902230452056774
having him but let me advise you to think better of it i know your	 3.03674804348206

the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly on	 2.9502151954891964
but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said jane	 2.648884291507655
they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a	 2.7932598289609354

the scheme every part of it would have been perfect	 2.9120351445728794
hard to have her taken such a way from me they are gone down to	 2.484245335623911

well my dear said mr bennet when elizabeth had read the note	 2.5092105333546093
she seems a very pleasant young woman said bingley	 2.42409356768416
lady catherine opened the doors into the diningparlour and	 3.0480243658395896
be his meaningand asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand	 2.504405423146874
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions	 2.4972204018846766

round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were	 3.201381635097822
hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing	 3.3852360071558225
countenance expressed real security such a circumstance could only	 2.719336030312126
darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily	 2.7969367154951574
despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with	 3.060814589961237

i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had	 2.9638065316581113

or why did he thus come a day before he was expected had they been	 2.3802221824088092

fairly conjectured from that though elizabeth who was by this time	 3.1306048918170375
she found that she was to receive no other answerand after a short	 3.431472326155532
with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia	 2.7139778290081025

i flatter myself that my present overtures of goodwill are highly	 3.4822676009452067
ladyship can hardly expect me to own it	 2.5684507640554424
often at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him	 2.9645418683497478
left you conditionally only and at the will of the present patron	 3.047508608066897
with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it	 2.6522910267296482
no more have i said mr bennet and i am glad to find that you do	 3.258926252053563
aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming i can now	 4.099829137006472
was almost incredible it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously	 4.370917006450687
frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty	 2.5233809362752693
which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the roommany	 3.0070962520678446
resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her	 4.042252674185618
distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at	 4.42350094942286
the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived	 3.3973049176259904
his constancy if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might	 2.835834628282497

packed up good bye give my love to colonel forster i hope you	 2.469991471930199
you are mistaken i write rather slowly	 2.60081275584231
you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her allow me by the	 2.4163334811518236
disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest	 3.10487569411957
soon dispatched for though dilatory in undertaking business he was	 3.378693758292151
at four oclock therefore we may expect this peacemaking gentleman	 2.3071965357446285
of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself he was a tall	 3.5997666392186938
who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her	 2.6487827069531376
with these requirements we do not solicit donations in locations	 3.0327341555083986
it the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you we know	 2.318897751313183
she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse	 3.0432999291809404
not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and	 2.8038199339104057

doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea it is as	 3.377058621251512
but you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviour as	 3.3599704018760415
herself was entirely insensible of the evil elizabeth had frequently	 3.2598908499584662
i shall be very fit to see janewhich is all i want	 3.63486320884443
continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown	 2.5365661170569873
you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins for she vows she will	 2.659663988267643
will wait on him of course	 2.8412803016382773
janes delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to	 2.7406656061010346
these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted instead of	 2.883070244565635
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself	 2.2962254195138505

seeking him up stairs with their mother when they were met by the	 2.5093849378507853
you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep	 2.772676377765695
belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the	 4.903976680625308
other and not disturb us with his company what shall we do with him	 2.4478298973557386
an exhibition	 3.0507095422697676
fine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her they	 3.083037516323709

she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her	 2.6539063238129237
oh shocking cried miss bingley i never heard any thing so	 2.712093255660144
because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a	 3.4460379403743944
they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her mothers	 3.4553725977766616
oddly	 2.0190770273117145
then turning to mr bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at	 2.8823158408979
but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of	 3.5066208854860554
and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear	 2.2120453315002613
sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they	 2.761709867791461
cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london well he is a	 2.761171055459742
never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting	 2.7747397691814313
you are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of your	 3.0721393073534125
of so many	 3.3050294690001727
own judgment of her situation the note was immediately dispatched and	 2.389828292257731
she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down he	 3.0763917395918132
the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect	 2.6047395543469247

present i have not room to do them justice	 2.8871425438524354
of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family	 2.6722295295443987

opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily	 2.6158055742184776
how you must have hated me after that evening	 3.0900472477100496
of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree	 2.7550475725957475
the indirect boastfor you are really proud of your defects in	 3.8860056083957772
behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of	 3.3491821602795753
friend met her with every appearance of composure elizabeth merely	 2.4714634460160663
insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of	 3.0385697049517413

too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a	 3.8006063564504964
pretty sittingroom lately fitted up with greater elegance and	 2.877777966013605
i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a	 2.6412657890514994
opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody	 4.0524865953323115
called and afterwards dined here why especially when you called did	 2.319623907483143
it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that	 2.6920220800541
in any other person present the supposition did not pain her she liked	 2.699747091713698
elizabeth looked archly and turned away her resistance had not	 2.96430689280572
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every	 3.4683854937948224
in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and	 2.719690887202527
jane on their first arrival at lambton and this disappointment had	 2.682723415489552
bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart	 2.5773534152084543
the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always	 2.7855653997850323
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it	 3.282244610042409

however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his	 2.9001062492738345
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily it was really a very	 3.167199876316162

collection despite these efforts project gutenbergtm electronic	 3.0160674739701667
while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether	 2.572846412830813
nobody feels for my poor nerves	 3.1583833707006628
nothing more to plague her on his account	 3.9517957521531906
was very obstinate i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real	 3.312391110544908
friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in	 2.298804814919
well as of mr darcy his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned	 2.7756464065729287

reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined if he	 2.5210366080871593
could not help answering herbut she said he seemed very angry at	 2.954483146948415
i do not believe mrs long will do any such thing she has two nieces	 2.192740651002177
pretty kind of girl she asked her at different times how many sisters	 2.4313228197550902
in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant	 3.234600323719586
youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming	 2.49600374731663
regulars thank heaven he has some friends though perhaps not so	 2.4908000065600056
good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of	 4.7745977063150065
she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy by the	 2.800087326932965

you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into	 2.4057674018234745

oh yes pray read on	 2.602773049081669
invitation	 3.889447568396621
in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an	 3.1260078162139555
and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be	 3.099671658361227
greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally	 2.969475722072457
jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told that he	 3.5658930051051843
the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from	 3.1770288002033062
how much civility on that ladys side the acquaintance would now be	 2.496213219764077
i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as	 2.9194739644601677
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him in	 4.016538473392175
was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered	 3.0569860230549275
towards him they are even impartial towards miss king i cannot find	 2.655509875027163
expose himself to such a man mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained	 3.5038880644674695
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me	 3.1351302454686265
and how impossible in others	 2.643786085470375
all cared about me we must have met long long ago he knows of my	 2.6850417900499277
distance was a beautiful object every disposition of the ground was	 3.2905949311839455
total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed	 2.7632987786072465
that is all settled	 2.969693284455616
of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger	 3.429939660177762
is nothing like dancing after alli consider it as one of the first	 2.5582184767052216
mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few	 3.05018107981201
present him to the living in questionof which he trusted there	 3.299754974330985
credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to	 3.8750589621446956
and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when she rose	 2.8095282612362444
subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left	 2.7152293863788914
chapter i	 2.783750536159031
justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to	 3.089836510090239
desirable in every respect so replete with advantage so promising for	 2.496289660996621
i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a	 2.568755752785664
together but enough of this you alluded to something else you	 2.559088062619263
but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sisters	 2.686768550269934
can be no occasion for your going so soon mrs bennet could certainly	 2.6074414036691334
history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have	 2.598017007345202
may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married	 2.5894243227640863
leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable	 3.083965023326563
mind charlotte tried to console her	 3.1271700629271058
perhaps we might be deceived	 2.783874642026081
i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every	 3.2432313733149276
pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs	 3.5005773626045515
honour or credit could now be purchased for her the satisfaction of	 3.030701741478075
their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing	 3.088303144717639
regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their	 3.504636269889656
conversation beginning with his parsonagehouse and leading naturally	 3.994986050592805
prove so for else they will be destitute enough things are settled so	 2.5304676948924656
pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her	 2.877323563301425
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the	 2.6018371263681526
at mr darcy there is a fine old saying which every body here is of	 2.503418008156397
i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not	 2.875259751869451
she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had	 4.7642421240170965
turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated	 2.852951245507145
humility it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an	 2.518510984935378
me for she does not know which are the best warehouses oh brother	 2.8312813124171936
whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is	 3.1795444731627156
assure you there are many amiable young women but the fact is that	 2.2673756286159046
first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her	 3.6545958491006374
family never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified	 2.4663498535371406
lambton elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated it	 2.434558452259171
between the mercenary and the prudent motive where does discretion end	 3.2643952216458905
eyes	 3.840246200071095
one point on which i want your advice i want to be told whether i	 2.527569505428348
have you any other objection said elizabeth than your belief of my	 2.80368053077552
agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it i am	 2.3354749951784304
by one spirit every thing relating to their journey was speedily	 3.263060188918211
i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time i	 2.991950543197137
eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twentyseven	 2.4920645457264614
ayethat is because you have the right disposition but that	 2.462538811777671
who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctuality as	 2.969558905973506
forster it will be quite a shame if he does not	 3.516662099668646
thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they	 2.706711579645024
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings	 3.9626321323453637
mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of	 2.4123268309279924
i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us it was more	 2.5657258045127387
lydia whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such	 3.0558379728400817
of that when they fall in love	 3.6952262359570023
which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving	 2.8567141772336426
assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an	 3.1460499959297836
mine i must beg therefore to be importuned no farther on the	 2.994268495578584
and angry with herself for being so	 2.6738309910581415
elizabeth herself	 3.3317654707763555
when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply	 2.4192894550451194
yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especiallya	 2.8339739924701255
visit the gentlemen arrived early and before mrs bennet had time to	 2.6253092582944872
first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to	 2.3482846507747692
little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a	 3.0850564072376994
and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin	 2.786015722524834
delight as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation to know	 3.5309616483681636
hunsford near westerham kent	 2.8526590489088663
you must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth	 2.8186989566597505
lydia were far from envying miss lucas for mr collins was only a	 3.095681777168833
moment alighted from his horse or his carriage she blushed again and	 2.928770706943863
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly	 2.8265837116446826
pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel	 3.206670582165979
approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed	 3.9092170841523015
pemberley	 3.429310979969281
hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was	 2.2385300144452636
unconnected with his general powers about ten or a dozen years ago	 2.5873442327671725
of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have	 2.1781797920500163
contain a denial	 3.1307042810252055
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter	 2.908262057587759
for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a great	 3.00018661560812
sir william staid only a week at hunsford but his visit was long enough	 2.4448266850368254
printed for t egerton	 2.736977208455287
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but	 3.0204450541262218
his mother as well as of hers while in their cradles we planned	 3.231995993557311
ease cannot write ill	 2.8094147097835047
into a hackneycoach and dismissed the chaise that brought them	 3.7489301809190856
1e1 the following sentence with active links to or other immediate	 3.3439167017355036
with hermiss darcy the daughter of mr darcy of pemberley and lady	 2.756881672993217
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mothers	 3.696676507342783
stairs these two girls had been above an hour in the place happily	 2.5148232372269
resolvednor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the	 2.978537815126868
all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt that	 2.9867106530589935
cheeks and she said	 3.109468388698102
received the work on a physical medium you must return the medium with	 3.722417231813228
as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment	 3.3158528346892675
and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would	 2.5147358360216945
curious to hear how it was managed	 3.2908477943066927
neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model there is not a	 3.1004040688338645
such another man for you	 2.6905347031314917
well and what news does it bring good or bad	 2.389160852186089
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it she immediately felt	 3.1521401986956734
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week	 2.9667471654551156
observation whichever were the case though her opinion of him must be	 2.8276004467504863
rosings i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it	 3.0899268169154963
their affectionate mother shared all their grief she remembered what	 3.371375113598122
but he added you will of course wish to have your humble respects	 2.516803561266442
it elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed	 4.172903654831003
case	 3.81863343321596
do you prefer reading to cards said he that is rather singular	 2.7199990784900896
they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and mrs bennet in	 2.6573814630764976
fitzwilliam darcy	 3.4207490460441505
affair became public	 3.039843668624289
reserve can be answerable for the event but in spite of all this	 3.646290110246583
opportunities to fix the problem	 2.9964382658185853
she when he knows who they are he takes them now for people of	 2.521549685734912
i have said no such thing i am only resolved to act in that manner	 2.984514083863303
i am not afraid of you said he smilingly	 2.8744000840288413
catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying	 2.517034943857453
seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the	 2.406787471323047
elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour at	 2.3004298832584347
but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my	 3.287513665468593
only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his	 2.9964572060087753
agreeable than his companion expected there was nothing of presumption	 2.5793955450440476
but before they heard again from mr gardiner a letter arrived for	 2.290962771486667
circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour	 3.9868951314524037
by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may	 3.0101506238996603
some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it	 3.2267435026296862
hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again today	 2.4388631231837277
millars regiment went away i thought i should have broke my heart	 3.0312415146436233
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty but if	 3.2391158885079996
her twice only think of that my dear he actually danced with her	 2.630362577687972
pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited	 2.637043575180682
ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly	 2.734544014143728
disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated	 2.54599420501527
but think and think with wonder of mr darcys civility and above	 2.4707908863231984
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every	 4.369358653010194
addressed herself particularly to mr bingley to assure him how happy	 2.6852736874663243
enquiry after the health of her family she answered with equal	 2.46821049778029
good health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after the	 2.163306062796879
extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others	 2.3083158062817613
calmelizabeths courage did not fail her she had heard nothing of	 3.7169468251987112
preceded it were familiar to them as it was certain however that	 3.2428610674359897
that noble place charles when you build your house i wish it may be	 2.8947972772500736
chapter i	 2.783750536159031
what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many	 3.1632619139553473
by mrs collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter	 2.6726545510115263
husband called out as she entered the library	 2.7440143927654317
your first position is false they may wish many things besides his	 2.243312733706991
with a large party nothing could be more delightful to be fond of	 2.4744861034867247
you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the	 2.5960567616607584
impertinence your uncle is as much surprised as i amand nothing	 2.6175993899844836
there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must	 2.7019377151558137
him more favourably spoken of by any one	 2.6327382255716687
on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be	 3.1802649296989376
very agreeable and i give you leave to like him you have liked many a	 2.3006539952982616
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report	 2.9743071995193198
set off together bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to	 2.526123026066388
aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose	 3.2225849480284867
during their walk it was resolved that mr bennets consent should be	 2.249201954744925
for one half hour	 2.8859367304368155
errors of her daughter must be principally owing	 3.5188437610600336
but what said she after a pause can have been his motivewhat	 2.4446453339693357
she is almost three and twenty lord how ashamed i should be of not	 2.5084056756408186
she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through	 2.48871467569294
can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good	 2.235294224429132
choose to be you shall not find me so my character has ever been	 2.634267188906124
two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a very particular	 2.7213356808095774
an hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there	 3.202429372134879
other provocations you know i have had not my own feelings decided	 2.952845120433297
been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way i wonder who first	 2.888191081879347
e gardiner	 2.7904549081100187
do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place	 3.1472575397095155
always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest	 3.0811010476686236
way and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again	 2.685123741534115
seated herself	 3.388891281371855
reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a	 2.4996530122095613
charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her	 2.3484193241324642
then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said mrs	 2.6914337593642905
the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their	 2.9504246418934197
ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it	 2.9296195235950138
no i believe not	 2.915807545455235
ask for compassion her home and her housekeeping her parish and her	 3.641399344116834
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement	 3.3644443625836966
have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you	 3.2649891248155964
i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate if it was	 2.8444343726983945
how tired i am accompanied by a violent yawn	 4.132768457351598
should meet	 3.4028981929683817
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjustany thing that spoke him	 3.9442321784013594
being agreeable where they chose it but proud and conceited they were	 2.5333161429325424
scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning but	 2.7362974992453304
to determine	 3.435314196911794
the highest kind they soon outstripped the others and when they had	 2.803484623209149
fish she had won and mr collins in describing the civility of mr and	 3.7243567482702398
arisen of mr darcy and their niece directed their observation towards	 2.7023092930342467
that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of	 3.1034591055252356
miss darcy was expected to dinner i wish i could see her my visit was	 2.4569368346229536
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own	 3.0068474162883154
it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr bennet and	 2.9847603266481677
oh noit is not for me to be driven away by mr darcy if he	 3.663732660293427
complied with	 2.9789283277416794
could most wish for and now do when you get to town find them out	 2.2391125127484295
extreme and continually was she repeating why is he so altered from	 2.700059045393256
yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight do	 2.3347569404468183
i have not a doubt of mr bingleys sincerity said elizabeth warmly	 2.9249460748093297
telling again what had been already written and when it closed	 2.7550708095345535
out well at such a distance as that you know things are strangely	 2.550274953172514
reflections is a very common failing i believe by all that i have	 3.2791714007550725
bingley what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself	 2.7834712419391088
lydia bennet	 3.4380966169189007
has she been presented i do not remember her name among the ladies at	 2.6547266247867984
we may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as	 2.611347114258321
her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances the	 2.258304499871832
finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a	 2.710588987669503
as he joined her	 2.9480259025609077
possible	 3.782240897704196
must have been benefited by marriage but he found in reply to	 3.034536032747404
eveningelizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment	 2.680995383494425
meet mr darcyshe felt all the perverseness of the mischance that	 3.588391634424321
the room and this is always the way with him she addedwhatever	 2.9720961969890176
sir william did not say much he was storing his memory with anecdotes	 3.5714775724222436
many months ago from mr wickham on this subject what can you have to	 2.6043192866574385
this is quite shockinghe deserves to be publicly disgraced	 3.897457170338853
is that his design in settling here	 2.6647943269875065
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the	 2.3814992460963613
by other men you had better return to your partner and enjoy her	 2.52745293865777
him he now wished it more than ever had he done his duty in that	 2.1682509866528976
her deference for his opinion	 3.6631480644291106
chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on	 2.2592740636086748
thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me we must not	 2.6041589386506474
she accordingly read and elizabeth who knew what curiosities his	 2.615720302400049
lizzy said her father i have given him my consent he is the kind	 2.732161996180346
his brotherinlaws intreaty that he would return to his family and	 3.9731053004241224
the case and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed	 2.6768275259823646
bingley if he had been imposed on would have much to suffer when the	 2.965910956104763
wonder nor condemn but the belief of his selfconquest brought nothing	 3.4963589002731075
my dear harriet	 3.2484123010777854
be traced to prideand pride has often been his best friend it has	 2.9498612047538626
render mr darcys conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a	 2.407488773059691
and fainter and in farther justification of mr darcy she could not	 4.191157666497411
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would	 2.5811161533833125
at length however his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of	 3.1420534580128536
suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his	 2.503372483778378
cold was their manner whenever they did her mothers ungraciousness	 2.4176958101674115
with every body and had so many favourites	 2.7310494166533283
to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my	 3.798053027262228
the colour now rushed into elizabeths cheeks in the instantaneous	 2.9515966320700167
directly	 3.4552617210681573
but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus	 3.6598664995695622
of this wonder it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the	 3.4009362821361204
make a most important discovery	 2.7023187819539474
perfectly satisfied but what does he say of the living	 2.3884416740849432
intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter	 3.7049847694698426
her being rather tannedno miraculous consequence of travelling in the	 3.2013834172774622
so	 3.661646098165002
there for several weeks mrs bennet was quite in the fidgets she	 3.5675328220876366
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know	 2.730993252220332
i am said he with a firm voice	 3.185077887468523
sudden departure an hour however saw the whole completed and mr	 2.847327612506089
liberal	 2.0190770273117145
what think you of books said he smiling	 2.4493715613124953
dying an old maid charlotte herself was tolerably composed she had	 3.4613973334156967
unblemished could make him in that case he would return no more lady	 2.357800343314275
my dear miss eliza why are not you dancingmr darcy you must allow	 2.55425708413246
is my father in town	 2.7903146671344032
be wondered at ignorant as you previously were of every thing	 3.310011141108867
disagreeable	 3.0961515440340865
i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself the recollection of what i	 3.7494347253933618
hertfordshire my dear cousin i flatter myself at least that you will	 2.9422812627278776
of seeing you at pemberley today	 2.966614267628019
that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection	 2.4159409873174926
indeed i am i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier	 2.7475329974275855
i am not now to learn replied mr collins with a formal wave of the	 3.114144715199968
endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and	 3.1561992671985317
down for two dances and during part of that time mr darcy had been	 2.4863333253570232
project gutenbergtm work and c any defect you cause	 2.496069300605725
despair i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in	 3.1725793222799803
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the	 4.214110463437138
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to	 2.8032472948766367
exceedingly as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its	 2.9217989447024006
well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingleybutgood	 3.4111503323050902
to do something or other about it	 2.6250226431429287
should now escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope of	 2.9697314440264573
wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them	 2.505064216918916
moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had	 2.855310984597406
lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in	 3.0780639474019846
building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of high	 4.375468185685617
with less perplexity her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what	 3.6330277974516743
the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the	 4.718155100378742
though it was not put in as it ought to be it was only said lately	 2.9704948923514607
1e4 do not unlink or detach or remove the full project gutenbergtm	 3.577817275577267
that we never let them know what has been said against him we must	 2.3691549889389947
wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for	 2.5432311918491677
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the	 4.5027147572007555
selfdestined to another	 3.292913989230085
others she had very little notice from any but him miss bingley was	 2.418055467753974
you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this i see	 3.586117688616704
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated	 2.5359340560308006
i care about it though he is nothing to us you know and i am sure	 2.7812510189392037
pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of	 2.8629918275588446
you observed it mr darcy i am sure said miss bingley and i am	 3.374187163566306
into the country to give a ball at netherfield	 2.786340702310201
wickhams absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling	 2.564251528590428
revolted in his offer to herself what will be his surprise thought	 2.405415681513517
elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a	 2.9383484026327493
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer its windows	 3.448373091069274
is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would	 4.14965215458065
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast	 3.6596237075692644
if elizabeth when mr darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to	 2.6115272232907634
say you to the day i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well	 2.551557956320254
till she could be foundelizabeth could but just affect concern in	 2.8258945148479038
looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity	 2.541095034103426
momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed	 2.3550559090038434
application was a something to look forward to	 2.629295309086926
take care lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointment	 3.1118243199703572
what sort of a girl is miss darcy	 2.9945123001719223
yesterdayare you much acquainted with mr darcy	 2.6598906585802573
this sad business of janes for my part i am determined never to speak	 2.3982849219284046
it to be from a circulating library he started back and begging	 2.887231082951159
and now we are better	 2.952929564274362
but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation	 2.5251265593643293
and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and	 2.832542314011762
trademark owner any agent or employee of the foundation anyone	 4.540193017742197
then who taught you who attended to you without a governess you must	 2.744553210624406
understood from the gardiners that you had	 2.791356750795162
individual work is in the public domain in the united states and you are	 2.708043674228281
wife may teach him i thought him very slyhe hardly ever	 2.6079938522289132
humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed up	 2.2782915497655276
his understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but	 2.842384294602167
journey hither your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i	 2.6000256873655756
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom	 2.6760599895658466
credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the	 2.812537610372565
pemberley	 3.429310979969281
saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts now asked her if	 2.3455641953919244
and what is fifty miles of good road little more than half a days	 2.54772843121071
it is not quite a week since they left brighton in a few days more we	 2.5532882003572057
remain freely available for generations to come in 2001 the project	 3.391441555746833
pair of ponies would be the very thing but i must write no more	 3.043457759843064
there was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her	 2.785427334794483
you are quite right to have his errors made public might ruin him for	 2.4928529622537865
to me again by letter for the presentation his circumstances he	 2.7631870172057402
will not leave london before he has found them who is to fight wickham	 2.446156485635658
that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth	 2.7231492089649594
offering his assistance as far as it would go but he found lydia	 2.423205255280066
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him their eyes	 2.912056000124098
assisted by kittys hints and additions endeavour to amuse her	 4.3147916154935535
their three months acquaintance they had been intimate two	 2.6424492601387057
visitor did at last appear but the shortness of her stay and yet more	 3.1096076926882277
she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her putting	 2.2245591612511264
probable consequence of her allusions to mr wickham and rejoiced in	 4.849994875248633
perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any	 2.416798488008899
heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his	 4.3738895956644255
lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to	 3.5464776182289337
the neighbourhood in general was beyond the collinses reach this	 3.6727024208542423
day her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long before it	 2.5858533148623937
any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such	 2.655889172589158
you cannot be more than twenty i am suretherefore you need not	 3.040318148898936
not one	 3.384532505198812
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best	 2.41693017090789
speak my mind and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling	 2.7101324228057058
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases	 2.7828869776282885
mr bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way you take	 2.93169781713938
reserve to mrs collins and whatever might be his feelings towards her	 2.895738008708832
two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal	 3.45706085556169
the impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn	 2.7257862184752413
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge by this time she is	 2.74681279286164
assure you he informed me himself	 2.5198760515094563
oh yes be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy say that	 3.1524519713918178
dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house	 2.783741747543985
arrested herand she beheld a striking resemblance of mr darcy with	 4.962558640185762
jane who were dancing together recovering himself however shortly	 2.3330794290529644
in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and	 3.7993708696159056
overtaken by wickham	 3.0448076175753345
that is all very proper and civil i am sure said mrs bennet and i	 3.123958514369124
out of the room as they went down stairs together charlotte said	 2.647387596522512
wickham and herself jane listened with astonishment and concernshe	 2.535766283793732
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city	 3.164190458872494
being loved by her sister	 3.666105402339559
she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her	 3.4576862399951374
to part us if he were so they could not succeed by supposing such an	 2.836390931289911
made her perhaps almost as happy as jane she saw her in idea settled in	 2.2618579251566424
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required	 3.646550670466375
him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the	 3.273836560271322
subject to the trademark license especially commercial	 3.338472600703992
came from it the coach therefore took them the first stage of their	 3.0233439073379134
how kind you are i know you will contrive it all	 3.0890240978038768
my dearest sister now be be serious i want to talk very seriously	 2.330480856418172
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention he	 2.2824308325780196
added i shall insist on their giving one also i shall tell colonel	 2.5157256651750703
her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved	 2.410431414731041
me and teach you not to believe a word i say i am particularly unlucky	 2.7262800475227618
opposite the front of his house it was a handsome modern building well	 3.3745282302763067
for the welfare of his friend	 3.8376063533990625
<NUMBER> to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt	 2.6682026903135747
i think she will she is now about miss elizabeth bennets height or	 2.337739268509028
i have an excessive regard for jane bennet she is really a very sweet	 2.365885632287071
i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship you	 3.169769233162724
my dear niece	 3.005356780978214
the same her peace equally wounded	 2.6121899924193195
likeness between the ladies miss de bourgh was pale and sickly her	 3.5281212107750375
i am sick of mr bingley cried his wife	 3.430941094737023
august 2	 2.2759724581815157
together in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the housekeeper	 3.176880268837262
copied or distributed	 2.848629752846581
subject	 3.4357868534085205
she is saving enough there is nothing extravagant in their	 3.1050388430227036
succeeds but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art	 3.8236267953566028
painful than elizabeths but whatever she felt she was desirous of	 2.812778928466697
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to	 4.129286010724962
brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of	 3.1461100516998566
they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them	 3.201027576387097
mr darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was	 3.193169372600819
with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure	 2.821579764330323
default of heirs male on a distant relation and their mothers	 3.2863976696808708
done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem her	 2.4715904674427476
bodythat is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy	 2.63570421430531
ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three	 2.4165024817730174
elizabeth would not oppose such an injunctionand a moments	 3.758791746974335
elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book he was	 3.5516407949604965
and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made	 3.474294650999454
to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she	 3.85571014691542
neighbourhood they shall never have admittance i will not encourage	 3.0637741144027584
four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge	 2.8682148140581925
mr bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided	 2.4167640579809024
she is a very finelooking woman and her calling here was prodigiously	 2.8314428347880733
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examine	 2.658151144400078
account for it	 3.253986935115337
elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the	 2.9432723869730237
him it is because he will not give himself the trouble	 2.495588030691429
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent	 2.478188678977919
which i have never acknowledged allowing the case however to stand	 2.893254908730145
you will never get a husband at alland i am sure i do not know who is	 2.8224792999746366
to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through	 2.9061947130739094
elopement i know it all that the young mans marrying her was a	 2.9889123829818383
you used us abominably ill answered mrs hurst in running away	 2.2585120911698775
aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused	 2.4963773461464416
foolish	 2.0190770273117145
saw him so affected poor kitty has anger for having concealed	 2.301209592758029
jane was so admired nothing could be like it every body said how well	 2.2456708027870635
darcy did not wish for cards and mr hurst soon found even his open	 2.623276534532214
their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance	 2.859742294613686
made her look handsomer than ever kitty simpered and smiled and hoped	 2.408111770882488
the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could	 3.631942209769002
entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of	 2.468920149760101
he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped to interrupt	 4.0124975867102055
the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five	 2.893086677155581
replies they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the	 3.5935830959546964
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the	 4.734464198623945
their journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm and	 2.4077219975355995
it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their	 2.7823009333433775
why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley i am	 2.598139021551246
they returned to the rest of the family charlotte did not stay much	 2.807197619516206
deny the justice of his description of janeshe felt that janes	 3.9887724529783983
promised to write again very soon there was also a postscript to this	 2.7652159240956284
in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that	 2.651742920881427
what to think	 3.306515724372102
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what	 2.9306323434713115
people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance	 2.550858296646509
though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his	 2.894458536154472
there is also one other person in the party he continued after a	 2.2295606694220824
setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to	 2.490566175573533
considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least	 3.273009229260155
accident only could discover to mr bingley her sisters being in town	 3.0202898546216255
your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was	 3.363249882411766

a good journey and invited them to come to hunsford again next year	 2.5521740112913074
when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to	 2.375607491728039
your written explanation the person or entity that provided you with	 2.9554707677676326
back her ladyship was highly incensed	 2.8206415103562144
seemed to imply it could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts	 2.935939058441844
she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself and to	 2.6731527715998156
wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions	 3.62771392143772
in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in	 2.9833966220350807
and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way	 3.3474267421724844
woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in	 3.029652906383307
elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the	 5.392182984919241
all copies of project gutenbergtm electronic works in your possession	 3.0651738091103953
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane	 3.302987154698179

you can but if i were you i would stand by the nephew he has	 3.2455884663631585
must confess not that i mean to find fault with you for such things	 2.723390097988105
friend to join it	 2.944186797765612
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive	 2.881660809500871
lives for a whole days têteàtête between two women can never	 2.310305976870204
consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to	 3.0986133855339966
but so we all do it is only that he has better means of having it than	 2.3832393308681663
did not you i did for you but that is one great difference between	 2.579051033685224
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt	 2.771652245317246
to improve myself for in my situation of life mrs philips was	 2.626907953272955
jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as	 3.5549185555319553

the chief of it her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline	 2.5699841750930155
pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence	 3.2830923329128128
his character was decided he was the proudest most disagreeable man in	 3.3052613215747675
which she chose to be insensible gaily continued oh mamma do the	 3.1623954830710375

herself into the power ofof mr wickham they are gone off together	 2.573742963549562
feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me and so	 2.4685103318327086
subject you may depend upon my seeking no further	 2.9164734563829913
having very frequent parties at home these parties were acceptable to	 2.355150220377669
appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation	 2.5583096205456055
my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to	 3.9022716259714643
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them	 3.9754000853960427
myself and of mr wickham too he shall not be in love with me if i	 3.139929480302724

possible claim on me in the present instance no principle of either	 3.5557525799242797
revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering	 3.7398925898566735
elizabeth turned away to hide a smile	 3.6119564729262508
all means to refuse him	 3.25633221540113
to be always so guarded and circumspect it is very often nothing but	 4.174711159448555
of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so	 2.4357631426410102
and that is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his	 3.0755514605634766

not like ease whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing	 2.2739039968723787

her father lifted up his eyes jane was distressed elizabeth looked	 2.8032893031681745
elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said	 3.849811717479334
when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a	 4.16971562634704
bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn	 2.5844100342185663
could not bear such suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paper	 4.04722511635147
it was to love of the ladys sensations they remained a little in	 3.4059547366404246

alacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir	 3.0974598670489115
ladies were ready enough to talk and mr collins seemed neither in need	 2.6631423716281266
always very short those to her mother contained little else than that	 2.510892116680305
should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five	 3.0478040860232927

yes she called yesterday with her father what an agreeable man sir	 2.1284242219550378
which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your	 3.6031692101231476
readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming and the	 3.572361916002913
for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in	 3.113216428202946
and jane seem so well to understand	 2.6089298648480512
that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and	 2.8772439995773595
than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls	 2.972459840647352

generally is jane had been a week in town without either seeing or	 2.491402084159936
displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter resignation to	 2.9850019010392166
well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few	 3.391521334897471
all mrs long and her nieces must stand their chance and therefore as	 2.4068190579203868
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation	 3.164998616618427

the children have been wanting me this half hour yours very	 2.763915792702801
lady lucas her report was highly favourable sir william had been	 2.1688514308490574
design nonsense how can you talk so but it is very likely that he	 2.9298777839490655
able to see your friends before they leave the country but may we not	 2.1591485355328004
all	 3.6028678188575958
treated you too and then when we came away it was such fun i thought	 2.5720166065927828
him he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very	 2.4818677168641723
mr collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife	 2.380875183159375
they had often attempted it before but it was a subject on which mrs	 3.0507694692025105
they went for neither lydia nor mr collins were once silent lydia	 2.1432575526930444
long letter but now having that to communicate which she knew would	 2.5405709711327726
which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against	 2.6593752505042225
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance	 3.046638077114255
likes with her	 3.104162622324848
ittill it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any	 2.394588232890389
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great she knew not how to	 3.015905765196441
that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i	 3.707600899877269
changed as that implies	 3.2155071475763277
if one could but go to brighton observed mrs bennet	 2.346429239498737
to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family a promise	 3.6306570104941884
cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style and which	 4.217777386471667
dissuaded from it i have not been used to submit to any persons whims	 3.850075691892765
colonel fitzwilliams manners were very much admired at the parsonage	 2.7922153120648217
i can believe him capable if indeed it should be so but i dare not	 2.6950376177969875
enough to help anybody to coffee and then was enraged against herself	 3.8649982838576022
she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her	 2.541742381009878
her eyes envied every one to whom he spoke had scarcely patience	 2.5513195968998335
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth	 2.915691553774187
from you very soon miss bingley said something of his never	 2.722553944690842

for her own visit there to know the rest	 2.559536288393667
as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to	 3.462039938422111
you need not distress yourself the moral will be perfectly fair lady	 2.63119673340294

who will claim an acquaintance with youmr bingley and his sisters	 2.8367614702064654
but circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging	 2.8925828264915556
first interview with its object and even before two words have been	 2.2379407865816803
as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance but though	 4.636625072956199
that mrs bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected	 2.737281143049487

question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined	 2.664596085786572
accusations were illfounded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour	 2.606515911901223
we shall do	 3.1566376156704234
expressively at lydia but she who never heard nor saw any thing of	 2.2665292467143763
is perfectly convinced of her brothers indifference and that if she	 2.8280864254451727
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration	 2.909960288725451
i dare say you will find him very agreeable	 2.9169608119074546
she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked	 3.384393217494863
for ever	 3.334704623191368
justly make you hate me	 3.3160008934333542
which there could be no difference of sentiment elizabeth listened with	 3.7754366797010137
connections i never heard of her existence till the day before	 3.7609963304390193
acquired by trade	 3.2141942002703368
sisters we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to	 2.9258477117172235
however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together	 2.428323220272829
disposition	 3.8513975597420527
mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise	 2.4609628148388043
have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is but now it comes out	 2.1064153912835732
feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a	 2.4250016762708224
agreed in wishing for the sake of their sisters feelings and	 2.5048063579322775
i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now when a woman has	 2.9604974467369463
may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious	 2.7926585838105735
easily learnt had never been his design he confessed himself	 2.6988081913325974
it will pass away soon enough	 2.5549869106355088
the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it	 2.7401506745063866
as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not	 2.4814351443825977
circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to	 2.568980193605941
of music then pray speak aloud it is of all subjects my delight i	 2.821039786723892
and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge	 2.951568248338462
daughter let us come to a right understanding into one house in this	 2.2262644090156427
her father was walking about the room looking grave and anxious	 2.538942713022998
conversation till they reached the house in the hall they parted	 2.5296157782545037
practically anything with public domain ebooks redistribution is	 3.7176136714774892

appearance before one came from her books and the other from her	 2.4210651637933402

not positively answerbut she did not know of any prepossessionher	 4.595506460180335
spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by supposing that	 2.817243238307392
his coming i am glad he dines here on tuesday it will then be publicly	 2.5862631137347334
did before him	 3.13465597831636
he would have been able to do something for him and his situation	 3.5081716187329985
not all that mrs bennet however with the assistance of her five	 2.4566417250204053
reverse there is a mixture of servility and selfimportance in his	 4.389439525460002
much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively and	 2.7339220522373235
know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear	 2.5314755782232945
charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away	 2.5162457409078325

reception however was of the most flattering kind miss lucas perceived	 2.857056041792164
she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as	 2.8230904847545206
quarrelsome discontented or too poor she sallied forth into the	 2.516942077342809
favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a	 2.377867028938903
urgent business calls us home immediately conceal the unhappy truth as	 2.9788764794739695
energetic	 2.0190770273117145
nay if you are so serious about it i shall consider the matter as	 2.7133470340505195
silence	 3.8219770068910033
this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of	 2.4544283773184064
and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her	 3.6960174002241466
proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone	 3.224298288785251
the project gutenberg literary archive foundation is a non profit	 2.758142728630408
to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she	 2.6315577137332262

yes maam that he was indeed and his son will be just like himjust	 2.831354686638364
society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for	 3.5644153068913496

been left as printed	 2.9303723885716426
suddenly addressed her with	 2.9889938278683514
the stream where there was usually most sport mrs gardiner who was	 3.229563743849177
oh yes said elizabeth drilymr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr	 2.7221072083201454
asked in the course of the evening elizabeth reserved to herself the	 3.181359498411674
who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of	 2.8456703370953575
now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and	 3.055759131374862
returning to netherfield again of giving up the house but not	 2.368988594801763
no no stay where you areyou are charmingly groupd and appear to	 3.5198497239845716
then after a short silence he continued lizzy i bear you no	 2.3871093871722975

he is just what a young man ought to be said she sensible good	 2.7709043353012786
a misfortune or that may comfort you under a circumstance that	 2.4806846216243894
first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the	 2.363235644246473

refreshment but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely	 3.145240358230079
can you deny that you have done it she repeated	 3.194113639582577
reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it	 3.0323303445611933
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner but do you think she	 2.947566050384404
and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending	 2.5346409773620686
you shall not deceive me i know it to be impossible	 3.6193326561014953

summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate	 2.5716377908762023
perhaps he must if he sees enough of her but though bingley and jane	 2.884628552333432
than on his ownto convince him therefore that he had deceived	 4.038802330284809
dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though	 2.642118384104624
the whole of the matter secondly she was very sure that mr collins	 3.6842484667633566
my news it is about dear wickham too good for the waiter is not it	 3.0271774273904692

sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips	 3.2004141811445233
throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be	 3.1845376078802845
oh no said elizabeth in essentials i believe he is very much	 3.1348559520133494
person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered	 3.4752012602718167

elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit	 3.451703639414879
the period of expectation was now doubled four weeks were to pass away	 2.560805755271393
which had at length closed her eyes she could not yet recover from the	 3.156789240395195
took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased	 2.661469326132291
give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much	 3.098752720277214
extraordinary one after my declaration i do assure you that i am not	 3.2691728807025178
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire	 3.563063490763364
gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before	 3.476625660036288
a little seabathing would set me up for ever	 2.7321938333803164
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the	 2.406239808219149
kindness on a more grateful object	 2.621892745923207
to talk again of either but there was still something lurking behind	 2.523936821593362
yours c	 2.7052071729652725
own words so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to	 3.2054454088920235
to expect him here soon lydia left a few lines for his wife	 2.7453611808469436
months suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she	 4.049034339163653
1f6 indemnity you agree to indemnify and hold the foundation the	 3.8874041688577012
did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was	 2.633714360293688
being the mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a	 3.877481649419857
breach but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing	 2.740866986744734
soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they	 2.3681844312798033
by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond any thing she	 2.6169737207314174
she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till	 3.385143404238882
resume his book but mr collins after assuring them that he bore his	 2.981699832451622
whether pemberley were not a very fine place what was the name of its	 2.409107562586561
phrase project gutenberg appears or with which the phrase project	 2.758415918677268
imprudent as to fortune	 3.1070297779175453
yes very different but i think mr darcy improves on acquaintance	 2.970393314096974
she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see	 2.64636507959128
thingyoung women should always be properly guarded and attended	 3.6729992425454947
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds	 2.7349350227109848
as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption	 2.6491976553167937
be censured slighted and despised by every one connected with him	 4.026511341126154
my dearest lizzy	 3.092017585329112
acquaintance in common and though wickham had been little there since	 2.4549739213547572
mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during	 2.6330549698150003
there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland	 2.587858226725616

to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn whither	 2.8432126938791487
flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of	 2.928566070566548
elizabeth almost stared at hercan this be mr darcy thought she	 2.658759223928117

could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by	 3.1465876532763164
acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should	 2.7199780116899968
that mr collins should be able to procure any womans good opinion	 3.3612360743902707
from the entrance hall of which mr collins pointed out with a	 2.742625183002491

the others with tolerable composure every thing was too recent for	 2.496403641531481
possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister	 3.1035831586777145
said for the present	 3.203836523684429
while you have been here	 3.3506388409045886

another month complete it will be in my power to take one of you as	 3.1850607161521136
part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree	 2.612916462064644

i honour your circumspection a fortnights acquaintance is certainly	 3.3139468048693765
nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement	 2.8918756701810713
elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded	 2.6776298434126464
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me	 2.9583161497512354
her husband might then have rested in its proper place	 2.5403634904430934
miss bennet do you know who i am i have not been accustomed to such	 3.3348108805869416

of the silliest girls in the country i have suspected it some time but	 3.2651554328664094
him she had hardly courage to speak	 2.879542814366091

her not objecting does not justify him it only shews her being	 3.504606348182975
i quite forgot i ought not to have said a word about it i promised	 2.519448628136062
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the	 2.925156778290501
delightful evening a most excellent ball i wish you had been there	 2.4411708107443544
i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally	 3.1988598926405643
rapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection	 2.4842095576128282
affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into	 3.2533106000498697
design of engaging my affection it is only that he is blessed with	 3.251934083499558
charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she	 3.0334363172278223
place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been	 2.3932442663650884
with any of them there was no one therefore who could be pointed out	 3.0641782832289097
when the door opened and to her very great surprise mr darcy and mr	 2.65562136095441
bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to	 3.005756048343321
pursue their first plan and even if he could form such a design	 2.3444949068256364
to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation must be	 3.551500052045105
real character it adds even another motive my excellent father	 2.3427711796978086
true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room well colonel	 2.9772173628546112
from pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her	 2.3950040342832337
hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news	 2.7081649361649225
such confusion	 3.1894907931899317
it for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone	 3.010012415207434
temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day when	 2.758808521743488
favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light	 2.2144246674421955
you are very kind sir i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may	 2.550801073415728
am sure my sisters must all envy me i only hope they may have half my	 2.5139689461336086

very great ill usage and most painful regrets at his being what he is	 2.8000422348673872
to do	 3.411683112358352
treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner i do not know the	 3.5266774576988156
express that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer you	 2.234841587821199
to invite him to read aloud to the ladies mr collins readily assented	 3.234863890264318
deservedly dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she may	 2.679865662094171
the servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathless an	 2.870804453053034
journey yes i call it a very easy distance	 2.457998104283453
visitor as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be	 3.294373942429052
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her respect	 2.473983374534962
passed off much better than she expected for mrs bennet luckily stood	 2.7985148304574614
elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to	 2.1789975453798354
them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and	 3.806818234006085
preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right	 3.2576344281336596
doubt i suppose of their being really married	 2.6808862916450322
a proper direction	 3.347288881077737
therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his	 2.5533640182264494

made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the	 4.332936424446395
colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send	 2.488482829793271
acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her	 2.615152566113709
there can be no doubt of that it is settled between us already that	 2.7605611676741306
did not expect such a compliment	 2.89748018178158
but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort	 2.9409748653679686
but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike	 2.513651231830996

only headstrong in such matters as these in every thing else she is as	 2.8183380448351265
not at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severe	 2.702897603160296
in at the lodge her spirits were in a high flutter	 3.2237117891479183
though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much	 3.7854385412111173

that	 3.31404720177268
behaviour in derbyshire	 3.18445382710219
placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find	 3.2122871945725846
his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and	 2.969523391061941
went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town but	 2.6624485555520283
but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see	 2.502430265225854

expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of	 3.6498943674966666
if i said mr collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i	 3.2676564150314458
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his	 3.148850644587205
myself how can you be so teazing	 3.058265690477042
think better of me did you on reading it give any credit to its	 2.266825986802347
she said as he walked up and down the street and had mr wickham	 3.062321414979505
exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them because wickham has	 2.3841959212149404
miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing mr darcy in any	 3.919304545623402
delighting both him and herself on being made acquainted with the	 2.4025903811959304
not jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait till her	 2.601184730750935
elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards	 3.2419111435871484
approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of	 3.2868027563539535
on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be	 2.3766103397311538

unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her	 2.747952034636724
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what	 3.3638295186648777
this would be nothing if you really liked him	 2.4722581085315434
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward as all	 3.3313136896170787
well cried her mother it is all very right who should do it but	 2.4726096409996625
make an offer to me	 3.0332687344648437
comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday she was	 3.060603110629674
unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his	 4.118818016079447

quite as their own i dare say whenever that happens	 2.859866781074782
of the surrounding families that he is considered as the rightful	 4.044568732927138
gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away there was no longer any	 3.1223488231550793
here she was interrupted again mr bennet protested against any	 3.5115143910041513
forster looked very becoming the other night at sir williams in his	 2.7429443339855157
their marriage at all more probable supposing him to be attached to	 2.910644925455163
catherine de bourghs attention to his wishes and consideration for his	 2.431964077505243
pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his	 3.2575541832870876
should not have known her again	 3.020849637839094
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the	 2.988961286847567
she shook her head i do not get on at all i hear such different	 2.9303749014780225
he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage	 2.4654103071402393
their engagements at rosings it was some days however before they	 2.395710258582661
to me i should not have been allowed to invite them	 3.3793703812206854
diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations	 3.372739986223788
angry but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained	 2.4153742796266955
friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked	 3.071522703062035
you must acknowledge to be true	 4.056172577441338
informed that she was very accomplished	 3.8567027406041627
added that of general unreserve the whole of what elizabeth had already	 3.1176081470628154
by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not	 2.4565194360535156
when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it and	 2.6929539509783496
warm commendation of him narrowly observed them both without supposing	 2.7835560226955836
mrs philipss vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his	 2.928452370775894
reasonableness she has known him only a fortnight she danced four	 2.412088564481129
many girls and what sort of young lady is she is she handsome	 2.4210922886250725
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords exclaiming	 3.192689298557393
walk and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he	 3.7383514124340365
relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt	 2.7856957873659898
steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and	 2.3782429611362654
his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said	 3.008434252428342
temper i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride	 2.3180728914139075
aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds	 3.263721953542362
to hint was likely to be very soon engaged	 3.1309945508250783
put me on my guard can there be any other opinion on the subject	 2.5862952782817183
that would have tempted me to accept it	 3.815817555541499
off together	 3.4218811800307773
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and	 4.1542480107225215
mr bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the	 2.9901049359299954
my dear brother	 3.210384996916056
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away unwilling as she	 4.163219360136435
her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such	 3.594980446376897
how can you be so silly cried her mother as to think of such a	 3.0780071955389654
waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to	 3.0710549732052677
it he must find it out	 2.8765707929278146
more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the	 2.583087356814626
evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to	 3.2995784355200604
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of	 2.950632369626841
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world	 3.327652804294685
smile	 3.8815137268135427
that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring	 2.2920715747039355
her own uncle if he had not had a family of his own i and my children	 2.7333846405438864
not their wish to force her communication it was evident that she was	 4.114702947056279
that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable	 2.6334249274629298
favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept	 3.091035915147316

again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the	 3.833765529998826
his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have	 2.5735638468074167
her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of	 2.8441956364382035
attention to the imperfection of the performance when you told mrs	 4.202152464380631
she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on	 3.3688101763212708
to assist mr wickham with money	 3.3962613158328177
name to her mother on her ladyships entrance though no request of	 2.47311717551795
to oblige you i would try to believe almost any thing but no one else	 2.8206819235321055
not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i	 3.645943087112159
their all walking out it was agreed to mrs bennet was not in the	 2.9838146138120067
oh lord i dont know not these two or three years perhaps	 2.3956039989934403
i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as	 2.848488320811209
even as a common flirt than she has been here the officers will find	 2.7416489831943096
a happier aspect the families who had been in town for the winter came	 4.036558650327321
astonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of mrs	 2.811413128571536
girls had been on the point of marriage and after all there was nothing	 2.8021651977656714
see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like	 2.8346451538723407

dear sir	 3.05392209507415
they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought elizabeth	 2.5133795092788094
he readily agreed to it	 2.8424182373983413
her better but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely	 2.47338222592279
could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her	 2.599013771640422
you mean to frighten me mr darcy by coming in all this state to hear	 2.726214752795393
in maria followed and the door was on the point of being closed when	 2.695800115404661
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she	 3.6378298272435443
winter is over	 3.1083092138274098
bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that	 3.253984020127411
ceased speaking replied thus	 2.8040893234918296
necessary in sir lewis de bourghs familydo you play and sing miss	 2.9784392644256927

before he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london	 2.68557291869328
but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the	 2.415015914071925
idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is	 2.625319575373611

mentioned your name but slyness seems the fashion pray forgive	 2.3626128814105964
somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham	 3.9067346944674255
effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications as i must	 3.7092213413775
darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence	 2.9150130471747957
to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together after	 3.0115491372190313

her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the	 2.562877182557919
the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper	 3.363026117181628
this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in	 3.3183116162569437

dishonourable to the stability of her lover she could not prevent its	 3.8880922596869665
calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a	 3.1836390210599608
welcome relief to him at rosings and mrs collinss pretty friend had	 2.4567570730507753

that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still	 2.79904529318016
would judge differently in the affair	 4.384682263838794

we were all dancing together at netherfield	 2.540648938187282

lovely as ever on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls	 3.114811229270576

finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous	 3.3985380961597036
and blushed again with shame and vexation she could not help frequently	 3.7996009717163624
patronage yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin	 2.948251054602179
it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with	 2.7134291213074766
and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of	 3.1025868232464027
course of this morning	 3.087906579878706
your arrival	 3.3592461725373504
lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia had	 2.849984751774654
bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to	 2.751618110392027
her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment her character	 3.5572129204533582
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt their first subject was her	 2.6519389314887047
the good news quickly spread through the house and with proportionate	 3.234726676909232
and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for any one in	 3.3873726739631236
always write such charming long letters to her mr darcy	 2.3772069570424077
but on returning to the drawingroom when her letter was finished she	 3.617369782786556

ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made	 2.6633475291749
leave but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least	 2.6944813669237733
i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a	 2.577622087086638

his will be disregardedwhy did not you seek legal redress	 4.256789948678097
about it	 3.3315969497745734
elizabeth said to her	 3.121481487211324
almost every day they called at various times of the morning sometimes	 2.478648992493768
esteem and confidence had vanished for ever and all his views of	 3.7554341386213452
mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men	 4.126724523384074
that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your	 3.085151057039331
admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust	 2.329896834143058
but my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is miss king i	 2.5819832241479497
such a risk but against this there were objections and she finally	 2.7410268085441403
continue the subject	 3.4640221599980343
will not take comfort in mine believe her to be deceived by all means	 2.48042668678785
their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to	 4.2305729846306095
young gentleman the son of her late masters steward who had been	 2.881588413675878
civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so	 2.9349112769174224
himself without disguise	 3.0968724600369284
would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been	 2.57696990379841
out	 3.757598261506571
merely on that account for in general you know they visit no new	 2.1780432663605875

trust i am resigned perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my	 2.7799040033550484
and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself does he	 2.359757576520095
bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he	 3.2739299132158264
there is such a sight to be seen i will not tell you what it is make	 2.819718402116891
you often dance at st jamess	 2.7568628609523014
do for us we do not suffer by accident it does not often happen	 2.613662452118011
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire	 2.9989314318982694
marked their several meetings in derbyshire and as she threw a	 3.3062400672293473
husbands incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her	 3.9158784898343884
can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment there	 2.701683925032489
but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so ill of	 2.4190151451603685
invariably silly	 3.2735699576629647
generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to	 2.5604031231062434
reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at	 2.9000627151464164
i was never more annoyed the insipidity and yet the noise the	 3.511220583633249
had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance but no	 3.9610004108406267
pride and prejudice	 2.570661158107772
cousins their time passed till they entered meryton the attention of	 2.3061130748838936
were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball	 2.747553444863905
chapter iv	 1.924954712018208
something and then they soon found out what was the matter	 2.613812266897083
not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to	 3.030542537476042
loud that any body might have heard us ten miles off	 2.4174697200239077
for an answer mrs bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was	 2.688849821649196
the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not	 2.3681124501269424
wickhamyour sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a	 2.279588566063718
of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her	 2.8910469504183918
appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed	 2.553870125437688
your sister is crossed in love i find i congratulate her next to	 2.9250223672333315
she believed he might have the best informed mind	 2.749381953839204
attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to	 2.915508999426457
heard it in silent indignation her heart was divided between concern	 2.6631246542184184
how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its	 2.211361343467254
what they were talking of elizabeth immediately began playing again	 2.640019874666231
an ensign	 3.0507095422697676
time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left	 3.6792788432047594
the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had	 2.5414240416841034
resentment a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without	 2.8848801627098615
and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her	 3.0218606422876846
him often and after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man	 3.633609551060672
away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of	 2.721761258087386
maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern	 2.4054125712638235
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock	 2.6657411088236693
themselves the one missent must be first attended to it had been	 2.6962721579783624
i should not mind any thing at all	 2.7393295203844144
even mention that gentleman her curiosity however was unexpectedly	 2.4457272766874327
yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her	 2.5132783735505395
no one but mrs bennet regretted that their stay would be so short and	 2.694241530040153
mothers permission for this address you can hardly doubt the purport	 2.2875442630460614
found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a	 3.2557966781216177
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight	 4.340700918902383
saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting with at least six	 4.066249111409483
but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that	 3.189268255495938
gardiners letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him	 2.453256620012478
to employ for captivation whatever bears affinity to cunning is	 4.461979831891642
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to	 2.41157985527879
impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by	 2.673488172502845
whom they sprung poor charlotteit was melancholy to leave her to	 3.798096879712625
received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his	 3.429825935340628
truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble	 3.5727682493689117
society she was of course carefully kept and though mrs wickham	 2.924641804764384
felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some	 3.3257681270744377
that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive	 2.514314406631699
was every reason to believe would be attended to and in the clamorous	 2.722435552156723
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was	 3.6535405943763406
nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable kitty and	 2.888514043953817
closure with this gentlemans proposals which of course you will be	 3.6278764000135437
coming towards them and concluding that she came to call them to their	 3.2910507767613897
companions all the way to longbourn elizabeth listened as little as she	 2.928574070651746
elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness she had	 2.8782787187906247
indeed i have sir was her answer she is a great deal too ill to be	 2.698644620465108
your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline	 2.991685623157874
information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved	 2.761107003147475
grantleys	 2.0190770273117145
of their being in love with each other many weeks	 2.7908824558002854
again by her sister	 2.9856068227687826
mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast the fishing scheme had been	 2.3800803552413567
speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such	 3.1171718732031892
gardiner was so little to be trusted	 3.144993159071056
reestablish a character we must not make him desperate	 2.771119923059451
chapter xiii	 1.924954712018208
elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with	 2.487662950614745
be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the	 2.272283556499826
either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at	 3.6280217807110335
understand it if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should	 3.9320491844360634
conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the	 2.2442338473027843
laughing myself at your surprise tomorrow morning as soon as i am	 2.6436045445057226
may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must deter	 2.737153427163345
could be done for lydia her uncles interference seemed of the utmost	 2.508998026745512
than to herself they had long wished to see him the whole party before	 2.8302424258488
them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the	 3.860464477201332
mr bennet made no answer	 2.6279168859687485
she will drop the acquaintance entirely	 3.632029373702592
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but	 2.9565179772871977
wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities were worn	 4.693086370357241
and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy	 3.928562157566406
elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said	 3.065916657367981
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood	 2.7001193733238016
not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your	 3.137972651367103
of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate	 3.4225606790156133
project gutenbergtm is synonymous with the free distribution of	 3.294646486906846
travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil but that is not the	 2.899769339455558
for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose it is	 2.9785642089858486
this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure	 3.9329573860235056
together can doubt his affection miss bingley i am sure cannot she is	 2.726658032722831
least not to elizabeths wishes for she was impatient to get home mrs	 3.195009357104378
can have no great inclination for talking nobody can tell what i	 2.400034862218478
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly	 2.7391826204633323
much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live	 2.8070233870246426
truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the	 3.1139268113015435
to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to	 2.269948714267884
upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is rather an	 2.171700904827559
each to be dwelt on farther	 4.103031024255899
i must not decide on my own performance	 3.7471349095170954
forgotten there was really a great air of comfort throughout and by	 2.469733418223158
that the interruption must be unwelcome	 3.7981717690417423
outthere is something very pompous in his styleand what can he	 3.243860359742
look was disputable it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often	 3.8647413957374472
expected her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment	 3.4503263961908774
the judge they are in the same profession you know only in different	 3.2768976039664133
her against him	 3.0723791057765863
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing	 3.729639259574477
politeness then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute	 3.201207408248949
words of four syllablesdo not you darcy	 2.756463436044234
a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to	 3.024032523108906
enjoyment like reading how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a	 2.622611614661915
to town again therefore stay quietly at longbourn and depend on	 2.848357697790102
but the gloom of lydias prospect was shortly cleared away for she	 2.937833577581883
when she was only eight years old	 3.033198914447445
contrivance breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield	 2.2777679014027945
there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he	 2.243585808994604
this is an evening of wonders indeed and so darcy did every thing	 2.577382752311774
lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said	 3.447770036840058
all lost upon me i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably	 2.431068615812159
you and your family monday november 18th by four oclock and	 3.574577961643315
equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your	 2.6732933746955903
very much	 3.349371844370537
there is a gentleman with him mamma said kitty who can it be	 2.684765972006751
herself not at all offended but he continued to apologise for about a	 3.8132008878593022
that is charming three daughters married ten thousand a year oh	 2.3116350925021094
other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial	 2.3204249247440587
friend would not call herself near her family under less than half	 2.2615769552614142
unknown before they could talk of nothing but officers and mr	 2.5558710641637243
good enough for him	 3.2462120942879733
they could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were	 2.7929621832144553
pleasure mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most	 2.54944668386221
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently	 2.905596648338004
first sees my aunt	 3.07445550330687
income go a good way this is my advice find such a woman as soon as	 2.374028635727539
of all the views which his garden or which the country or the kingdom	 3.174756603006262
she could not think of darcys leaving kent without remembering that	 2.8987774481740023
children was so highly reprehensible but she had never felt so	 3.2032227431420335
voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for	 3.487786939674671
and unvarying society	 3.0451236753919395
both gentlemen as i did before	 2.8320544167977992
whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable	 4.319644670088253
doings discomposed mr bennet exceedingly in his library he had been	 2.928709615084485
has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise	 2.893010024538711
five grown up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own	 2.375803645953246
solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no	 2.9875667581071843
what he is about he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by	 3.5592863755016504
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those	 3.254010906825639
satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingleys quick step	 2.8489897694054878
politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place	 2.353771207017366
to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account i often	 2.7138235349713162

her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy jane resolutely	 2.9533875274819383
hertfordshire every body is disgusted with his pride you will not find	 3.313382905043826
myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce	 2.5858329300419864
in a few minutes mrs bennet half opened the door and called out	 2.6464312161475476
is also comprehended she will follow wherever lydia leads vain	 2.6558698480087357
forward to as possible at some future time	 2.5310527652870345
this cannot be this must be the grossest falsehoodand when she had	 3.578542814930542
sure it will be too much for kitty wont it kitty	 3.0289056091316366

there was no want of discourse the bride and her mother could neither	 4.50852019924379
much superior solicitude of mr bingleys she could not make a very	 3.715168987516087
tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which	 2.7995037600802837
determine what to say in reply you wanted me i know to say yes	 2.5097145864446166

that will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at	 2.828784572676979

the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good	 3.0678339719962913
her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her	 3.331010362217621
mrs bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of they	 3.1228772725279175
can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this this young	 2.5986898139804318
till its success could be known likewise for though feeling almost	 2.19678694798015
provoked her	 2.80626952168695
answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring	 2.958320243247511

that she could not leave her bingley urged mr joness being sent for	 2.986034468900144

to understand it could not be for society as he frequently sat there	 2.555578600793931
elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by	 2.8623683838686897
prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain	 3.2180144260432777
known sir williams too long he could tell her nothing new of the	 2.305491861896188
take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the	 2.809336283157348
hearing from caroline she accounted for it however by supposing that	 2.9521427611674222
together	 3.7713808401562123
how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her	 2.8597466087248335
their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing	 2.8952151884301447
chapter v	 1.924954712018208
a father acknowledged the whole to me you may imagine what i felt	 2.320350160817404

mrs bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married and she	 2.4628403905825067
elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject	 3.2540444064244562
when is your next ball to be lizzy	 2.5276232438045256
so much both of mr darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was	 2.8391723643423195
persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not	 2.7645954194283466
without constant practice i have told miss bennet several times that	 2.729544942511418
any thing else fatigued as she had been by the mornings walk they had	 3.732265440097109
gracechurchstreet the evening before i came home but mr gardiner	 2.4683575265602182
that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to	 4.903840652689229
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over she would not	 2.454451817988972
my seeing mr jonestherefore do not be alarmed if you should hear	 3.622408276302383
then i saw him too it was not all settled before monday as soon	 2.852609970953178
not one of them i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good follies	 3.0613902447986434
no i should have turned in a moment	 3.1888381659224496
met elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an	 2.417008589528334
such as creation of derivative works reports performances and	 4.370161371680097
this was a sad omen of what her mothers behaviour to the gentleman	 3.3636576399172493
as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage	 2.4358323852623744
called during her absence mr darcy only for a few minutes to take	 2.6087788012483815
cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the	 4.239839878406647
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself	 2.212559941854945
i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy	 2.963139857057999
paragraph 1c below there are a lot of things you can do with project	 3.2608498746940877
supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough	 3.5561322322825846
i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly	 2.912255666098723
about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready	 4.039715825655556
vain and nonsensical as i knew i had oh how i wanted you	 2.823982975189892
regiment	 3.8286709861491164
collins then returned to elizabeth	 2.7786770688505347
that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot	 3.432983439863931
but elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already	 3.5073659881058763
he then went away and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of	 3.1614626121622176
but it will have no effect on me	 2.6020973105655316
court	 2.0190770273117145
and goodhumoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose	 2.6500585459369113
proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs	 2.986673356526476
a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would	 3.5075067049664104
mrs bennet give up the point she talked to elizabeth again and again	 2.498718534663358
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity to have	 3.42373828689026
do not you want to know who has taken it cried his wife impatiently	 2.618244310292808
concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a	 2.903889087277761
you till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your	 2.7048471475307725
as they concerned george wickham what a stroke was this for poor jane	 2.576789997990521
you must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon mature	 2.687877589431682
catherines carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter	 3.46489102747715
error i have certainly meant well through the whole affair my object	 2.478956675656738
of perfect civility	 3.0513387369845932
one sleepless night out of two	 2.6724894409482762
why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that	 3.267196753825615
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection mr collins	 2.656110725157319
catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding	 2.5294991003996903
sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane	 2.5079827763123856
gentlemens appearing her colour increased yet she received them with	 3.044811706824342
london in a respectable line of trade	 2.9066057796320575
us as soon as you returned i have not forgot you see and i assure	 3.2452028539392233
varied however her determination never did	 2.7745969423877175
of pleasure was lost in shame she felt anew the justice of mr darcys	 3.1891535913791134
was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it	 2.373059324196673
bingleyand pray what is the result	 3.2342524517568565
were by themselves how strange this is and for this we are to be	 2.4661339414390286
him before mr whats his name that tall proud man	 2.417791015616148
she had purposely thrown herself in his way again oh why did she come	 2.7665659576347226
things that you can do with most project gutenbergtm electronic works	 2.6437370548103623
brought the following note for elizabeth	 2.640480522074019
it is well you refuse then to oblige me you refuse to obey the	 3.180449066909617
emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world	 3.9726558508440926
as i might have done but the horror of what might possibly happen	 3.5342303377381117
less his son might have borne with me better but his fathers uncommon	 2.6958234772998724
to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming	 4.6749566620520735
with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at	 2.9761016735903
weight i may suffer from the want of money younger sons cannot marry	 2.5751567597400573
money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared	 2.5683657223957206
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish	 3.767669675335272
he was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence	 2.6271478157199604
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man i would	 3.8262756875343458
bingley had now been gone a week and nothing was heard of his return	 2.5179099267386564
she was still dear to him perhaps he had been civil only because he	 2.5397190584369156
things though the words are often used synonimously a person may be	 2.290788187869213
therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that	 2.905525137284747
was not unwelcome for its own sake the journey would moreover give her	 2.6245178469381942
were the principal inhabitants they found mr bennet still up with a	 2.477918539298115
disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her	 2.3919986311447907
amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you	 3.9539578342610198
called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was	 2.6300948234837085
and her husband at longbourn as soon as they were married that he was	 2.8242018309344794
performing copying or distributing any project gutenbergtm works	 3.0970787220197122
knowledge she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor any thing	 2.647135854864268
very proudas a child she was affectionate and pleasing and	 2.4196357899678222
subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went	 2.8267280098361827
and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice oh lydia	 2.8166909440534726
not rest till i knew the particulars let me thank you again and again	 2.172162128947218
evening after tea mr bennet retired to the library as was his	 3.0145297656166146
one owns a united states copyright in these works so the foundation	 2.3314639404254924
end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way mr	 2.970884562097079
makeattention forbearance patience with darcy was injury to	 4.091923442897971
longbourn before she told her sister of mr darcys proposals to know	 2.891968403120009
if you are not so compassionate as to dine today with louisa and	 3.765325660669561
how really happy he was	 2.6718058550904753
i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and tell the	 3.1978346107267015
it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen i was	 3.995483606193456
and taking her hand he would have given it to mr darcy who though	 3.124079141934136
referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam	 2.8764551412990613
can all plague and punish one another teaze himlaugh at	 4.357421753374321
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to	 2.63614961064056
even to charlottes wishes to be the case and after various	 3.226235222735665
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for	 2.6968221431549764
for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it	 2.206420020643637
address most truly the gentleman mr darcy looked just as he had been	 2.9804866144352986
which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room and	 3.285718652253281
wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of	 2.6312458717936225
down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much	 3.030383176626472
done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlottes	 3.5577534680367724
on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by	 3.808775516040743
the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined	 2.2214453906398735
and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it	 2.827120717028162
him too little to care for his approbation	 2.954787084507585
mr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted	 2.624809877787491
and by that means as i told lady catherine myself one day has deprived	 2.2678229159096626
already arisen repeated mr bennet what has she frightened away	 2.5755302500387596
he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring i had not	 3.2342831355617294
turned silently away mrs bennet who fancied she had gained a complete	 3.4736574280446852
is nothing he would not do for her	 3.061060398909416
almost every day she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had	 3.6263395997843313
business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world for	 2.760712974392103
particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him	 2.7217801145259446
acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an	 3.9114068148754693
imprudent as a marriage between mr wickham and our poor lydia	 2.560520059672867
yesbut he seemed to like his second better	 2.6436087080970823
go the next day for a short time	 3.034425110084298
character perfectly well here consequently was an inexhaustible subject	 2.6268048931762067
added kitty	 3.316749169085556
as likely to give any news of him and in the wretched state of his own	 3.527363438332674
almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond	 3.9080744730986767
the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her	 3.0287376590815853
disagreeable	 3.0961515440340865
shall keep mine to swell my song	 3.063360732023009
softened by his manner of expressing himself	 2.992111416143927
himselffrom whom she had previously received the information of his	 3.097940900896733
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer	 3.062499475419219
come darcy said he i must have you dance i hate to see you	 3.1513874703089972
different walks i think she will be pleased with the hermitage	 3.265424021851205
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up	 2.9800022747897614
and every body began to find out that they had always distrusted the	 3.0962202769384293
between distress and diversion mrs bennet and kitty walked off and as	 2.9625033491771187
elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him	 2.9110139047140793
on one side of your lawn i should be glad to take a turn in it if you	 3.2035719309220285
they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me	 2.5798875790903244
considered therefore as finally settled and rising as she thus	 3.264196335390478
officers at once	 3.2144233414877132
your lady and daughters your wellwisher and friend	 2.918521509107454
affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive	 2.8398720457536735
for there was much to be discussed wickham of course wanted more	 2.9959836394276764
with only one there is but such a quantity of merit between them just	 3.424503527529148
of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished	 3.1599694498629445
reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last	 2.751925540284468
and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to	 2.4977488760281243
several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the	 3.267756753085447
you on an affair of importance i understand that mr collins has made	 2.3886698588193553
true said mr bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of	 3.4978668437291187
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in she had fully proposed being	 2.8219256577782064
concerning either detection could not be in your power and	 3.216575011244578
including obsolete old middleaged and new computers it exists	 2.6620893621125323
i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham i can	 2.995151262261925
no interval of ease or forgetfulness	 3.221698475988088
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience	 2.844456112433973
rained hard her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was	 3.432783789215022
determined he should know it and so i let down the side glass next to	 2.3735726432373125
had reserved for them but jane was to go home with her and at	 3.0135664878002375
the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her	 2.213597796408208
for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure	 2.5049340149518895
posterity with all the eclat of a proverb	 3.6658160457827123
situation hastily exclaimed i beg your pardon but i must leave you	 2.957420396562576
hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered	 3.411958466351426
possible to find out led the way across the street under pretence of	 3.0945002315317396

disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last	 3.846192948839795
him better when they met in kent than before and that she had never	 2.869376214331434
and it was done for the beston this subject i have nothing more	 3.4401355453119273
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or	 2.527048760835313
ready to believe for every bodys sake that she may feel something	 2.3190870429008466

brought him from london and that he was to have a lieutenants	 3.5594769055849973
room	 3.7927815477933393
not the slightest i can remember no symptom of affection on either	 3.600337636120656
aye no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had	 3.158383900546333
yesthe late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best	 4.250739175102085
every thing seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him	 3.056676041920484

letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be	 2.6437890603450125
and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one card	 3.1762275888860363
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of	 2.80303660106349

with anyone for forty years he produced and distributed project	 2.78861787936642

more unequal than she had often seen them	 3.2978569132847917
me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i	 3.0978655755337727
wickham what a good joke it will be i can hardly write for	 3.1508734110521734
i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed cried	 2.3113483897664455
exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephews letter that	 3.7753149562499844
mrs bennet rang the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to the	 4.302306363476311
meryton and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that	 2.634867356864408
thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears	 3.3394123356362693
after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr wickham	 2.5897919248486363
she did indeed louisa i could hardly keep my countenance very	 2.499403550733357
as affable to the poor	 4.025104765653492
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she	 2.376589712560733

to dine at rosings the next day	 3.2864519049002228
thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you	 2.6704457678391953
much but he saw only the father the ladies were somewhat more	 2.4797626416724494
at least he has not deceived us haggerston has our directions and	 2.5120442828983243
certain absolutely certain	 3.1048286548412043
no indeed i felt nothing but surprise	 2.4921261923235294
long speeches of mr collins who was complimenting mr bingley and his	 4.224781020172476
collection are in the public domain in the united states if an	 2.9372782178617296

bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way	 2.4378336110567775
collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed	 2.6393728401465086
signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however	 2.7098874506864843
were not decidedly better bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters	 2.938951196347599
in confirming or crushing it steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke	 4.033427946170442
oh my dear brother replied mrs bennet that is exactly what i	 2.477350366251033
with an air of decided fashion his brotherinlaw mr hurst merely	 3.730073131421072
either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object it	 2.318047461890012
completely in your wayand if the second i can admire you much better	 2.578710450361723
delighted with him he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely	 2.6279485343418303
indeed mr collins all praise of me will be unnecessary you must	 2.8142012597773243
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always	 3.0393856590550263
for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle and you saw the	 2.8425179232657
solicitude they shewed for jane the apothecary came and having	 2.8980930891803296
colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality	 2.858006975514448
and wish him all manner of evil but my feelings are not only cordial	 2.2633559934457628
enjoyment was certainthat of suitableness as companions a	 4.221218157681785
at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few	 2.947974752333844
for my own part she rejoined i must confess that i never could see	 2.875218433125913
party mr bingley had danced with her twice and she had been	 3.9616389709787394
boast and so fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to	 4.36357806986586
she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might	 2.3548414335902947
your equipment	 3.1631527470642697
earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of	 2.714584079889259
jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to	 3.1069377062160224
i know not miss elizabeth said he whether mrs collins has yet	 2.513128683990648
her voice was weak and her manner affectedelizabeth was in agonies	 3.724725949208412
our dear bingley what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always	 2.9198927252189426

mrs bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some	 2.582118914378512
a ball was at any rate a ball and even mary could assure her family	 2.5225075314074847
an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her	 2.646976058693579
thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think	 4.378228471587558

you comply with all other terms of this agreement for free	 2.8279251848102187
it is wholly out of my power you must feel it and the usual	 2.4608619634837177

her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock chatsworth	 3.732693940789504
oh mr bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar	 2.576090549486349

their corps this was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted	 2.853778218970885
bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out	 3.6476412407265473
repeat his persuasion of their not marryingand from that i am	 4.1152108531758556
is nothing the matter with me i am quite well i am only distressed by	 2.894328795422109
having such a master	 3.1201171280926765
foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day	 3.8697545211549413
strong already but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i	 2.5333390175910173
not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering	 2.266507186197337
catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which	 3.8904079760183516

the family	 3.3623615458797396
with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel	 4.0026294038273385
ignorant and less insipid from the farther disadvantage of lydias	 3.289604256899139
ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise but no	 2.8431546445668574
elizabeth and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment for she had	 2.5321273154100576
mothers rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated	 4.503405613005602
indeed mr bennet said she it is very hard to think that charlotte	 2.8689126737843766

for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it	 2.792210336841869
their visits to mrs philips were now productive of the most interesting	 3.735375189929255
victory over him continued her triumph	 2.899212240572782
feelingly a younger son you know must be inured to selfdenial and	 3.37849189610906
neighbourhood except netherfield he is not at all liked in	 2.7187201174680293
she made no answer	 3.086590766445021
she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited	 3.6204365230567435
be though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte	 2.5136195816316595
had left her four thousand pounds	 2.5865877550790155
mrs bennet and mrs philips was an amiable intelligent elegant	 2.8235380222934903
quite through in a very close handthe envelope itself was likewise	 4.05286193909904
from any one but myself he is gone to my father already oh lizzy to	 2.584679392286391
you look conscious young ladies have great penetration in such matters	 3.0715524727224315
unreasonable my brother admires her greatly already he will have	 2.342230401002534
and have you answered the letter said elizabeth	 2.4505341577099173
before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part	 2.3452642768723795
tranquillity	 2.0190770273117145
you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and	 2.1765046205762024
things said than i am going to say but he is an ugly fellow i am glad	 3.5818866222796317

saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed he was received by mrs	 2.716270298701701
jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy mr bingley was	 3.344371650102373
when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone now was the	 2.362923354704493
first to listen and to pity the first to be admired and in his manner	 3.3393174765036653
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them	 3.284022284076339
the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux	 3.146653687739675
if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your	 2.5720587195256415
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the	 4.853983642334215
her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her	 3.823935646758098
a most country town indifference to decorum	 2.444429136658959
compared with some families i believe we were but such of us as	 2.7469146021566693

part of each was when the post was expected the arrival of letters was	 2.808693008618887
mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he	 2.465729163634918
resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it	 2.7499752028000715
i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment	 2.703373824739898

private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before	 3.072127196860394
pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her	 2.904473023001523

as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she	 2.8240674108310455
occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself	 2.578206844828633
it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he	 3.8077138045854
their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could	 3.202620672115045
assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to	 3.595693409136524
the project gutenberg literary archive foundation	 2.435569934171987
there is not much the matter with me	 2.841485622181784

oh your father of course may spare you if your mother candaughters	 2.552301690111607
astonishand perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly	 2.7350571570803908
what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself the	 2.1635912847167336
had a very different story to hear	 3.2578729160160065
that the chimneypiece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all	 3.6524860006516096
i understood that there were some very strong objections against the	 2.2592457586487633
of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as	 3.32996521981096
it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it	 2.7815557330956837
yes thought elizabeth that would be a delightful scheme indeed	 2.498327939163635
uncle would most readily have settled the whole they battled it	 2.373959742923977
till elizabeth entered the drawingroom at netherfield and looked in	 2.5760096600433826
that led to the copse elizabeth was determined to make no effort for	 3.786430698111252
mrs collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria and	 2.8455766258166926
all compassion in anger she tried however to compose herself to	 2.635839205290497
to others as in his reproaches to myself after this period every	 3.1198834040629104

mrs gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in	 2.398423936363689
but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by not	 2.1906952083767126

in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the	 2.4074705543743855

in the first place replied mr gardiner there is no absolute proof	 2.9150086683636527
it is a long time mr bingley since you went away said mrs bennet	 2.705222791266105
more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly	 3.009381387391445
softened its impropriety of expression	 3.3117091187592056

elizabeth took the letter from his writing table and they went up	 2.4412276543977742
indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancingi entreat you	 3.968784989598145
could i expect it to be otherwise said she yet why did he come	 2.616967793130243

sufferbut it is always so those who do not complain are never	 2.8972523739709164
with every particular of these transactions if your abhorrence of	 2.857312700190597
not speak another word darcy in wretched suspense could only say	 2.893026342667561
speak to lizzy about it yourself tell her that you insist upon her	 2.5341892161653945
your regard during my stay in hertfordshire as for my fair cousins	 2.30026903785668
they were now to spend a few days was probably as great an object of	 2.416930196471851
well well and so mr bingley is coming down sister for mrs	 2.430980328543222
with his friend	 3.0778210514080264
oh said lydia stoutly i am not afraid for though i am the	 3.2015582636626605
are provoking me to it every moment	 3.314720525001354
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right	 4.638387896823114
mutually silent on the subject and elizabeth felt persuaded that no	 2.9966651113503837
superior to his sister as well by nature as education the netherfield	 2.6706795506372947
ever so similar beforehand it does not advance their felicity in the	 3.6635900143763585
forget it ourselves they were off saturday night about twelve as	 2.673937673762186
did not come back she should think herself very ill used it needed all	 2.2378690083076442
one serious parting look went away	 2.6200309540770417
elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the	 2.3676584805753156
might in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbers	 2.4064237495670744
inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to	 3.170702433723928
sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the	 2.4376506671843488
wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an	 2.19336282267138
introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers	 3.9156866620223543
aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable	 2.971514045320247
received an invitation from mrs forster the wife of the colonel of the	 2.340643556974041
mrs bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under the	 2.9588509927895545
all probability from the influence of their brothers admiration it was	 2.989696245404027
also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her	 3.4170201480082514
the whole of the journey from elizabeths thoughts it was never absent	 2.442888446641817
he should be particularly happy at any time c c and if she would	 2.6143284512024136
what chance could there be of improvement catherine weakspirited	 2.6945149379282824
an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after	 3.282102182486543
but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their own	 2.9420543242753148
where is your sash my dear	 3.523285398053993
if i have i shall be the last person to confess it	 2.8826096311051583
seemed danger of lydias engrossing him entirely for she was a most	 2.7897376660198727
partner	 3.831094019204359
preference which was often given me	 2.754325045170376
wickham really is we both know that he has been profligate in every	 3.124085090872197
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of	 3.5282170434828575
rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success he	 2.385098448947206

people in all walks of life	 3.6169945295337755
sister they are all for what they can get i am sorry to say it of	 2.4502889333363287
debt but i hope this may be false	 2.9921666617348093
received any invitation thither for while there were visitors in the	 2.273106694803443
family pray do my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tone	 3.0070476219801363

why is not every body as happy	 2.716745806192706
bingley	 3.2296966074733375
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs bennet got	 2.5495780219357465
carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if	 2.8938339822906975
was her business to be satisfiedand certainly her temper to be happy	 2.9611739998892563
the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great	 2.51907982432346
lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in	 3.1143356142260035
now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think	 3.351472608908845

waking mr hurst	 3.13516828035743
mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his	 2.603454686345908
a little more liveliness and that if he marry prudently his	 3.295515818327575
at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often	 3.9374636203470676
disposition and talents would most suit her his understanding and	 2.5866033715430126
marriage he shook his head when i expressed my hopes and said he	 2.6306619099031754
they found mary as usual deep in the study of thorough bass and human	 3.318359662275473
as the rattle of the chaise elizabeth loved absurdities but she had	 4.29847098424426
good will of mrs hurst and miss bingley and though the mother was	 2.8135476806454705
elizabeth half expected mr bingley to do he was able to bring darcy	 2.6216927907334147
on wednesday or thursday will you be very angry with me my dear	 3.0696492366975057
i can guess the subject of your reverie	 3.897136385355442
then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce	 2.9477829164432987
way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and	 3.5455588984827147
almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcy	 2.7607780315118537
my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now	 2.9370787519647146

expect you to use it your father would depend on your resolution and	 2.2276585871475194
bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy	 3.058042122551157
that lay on the instrument how frequently mr darcys eyes were fixed	 2.729631099132523
of her chair not knowing which way to look elizabeth found herself	 2.5658177134309907

younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he	 2.569586405214166
as i canor perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away	 3.0513481306950667

their sisters wedding day arrived and jane and elizabeth felt for her	 2.646199365128785
compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings	 3.192057974133279
to him without any reason it is such a spur to ones genius such an	 3.6731233999187936

he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being	 3.584422351489473

charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till	 3.089060139649763
and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for	 2.7210129408916686
bennet and kitty though she was perfectly unknown to them even	 3.0741404292738426

talking to her brother he who had always inspired in herself a respect	 2.562182947529074
though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour and when	 2.606696200932855
going to pemberley especially when he was least expected	 2.620983976614053

i do not at all know but i heard nothing of his going away when i	 2.4828338531728225
in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh	 3.188730938697085

more then addressing her daughter oh my dear dear jane i am so	 3.0576075337521673
prepared to admire them at present i will not say more but perhaps	 2.627219240548386
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr darcy	 3.1261368029726544
and her sister just returned from their walk the têteàtête surprised	 2.5269889864607045

my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to was a question	 2.58871981729484
my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your	 3.2384486898647995
domestic happiness were overthrown but mr bennet was not of a	 3.213754521691354
i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women	 2.4344094918395207
any body as he has done by poor wickham he has not an illnatured	 2.58446095964896
that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed	 3.067949187235573

he is as fine a fellow said mr bennet as soon as they were out of	 2.9913250837085807

you already use to calculate your applicable taxes the fee is	 3.9636135185335166
as we went along kitty and me drew up all the blinds and pretended	 2.7386721131985423
but three miles from them were the first points of selfgratulation	 2.847278704481741
his parishioners whenever it were required	 2.6650376882582107
in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow	 3.2554716676691675
may i ask but checking himself he added in a gayer tone is it in	 2.658927050370339
it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon	 2.4671031578788076
well lizzy said mrs bennet one day what is your opinion now of	 2.803981709250084
of temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave	 2.3319154265713102
again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to	 2.879698696869806
amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds	 2.9902294514141015
going to the butchers she told me on purpose to order in some meat on	 3.8766000182194884
it must have been his sisters doing they were certainly no friends to	 2.340093474016156

we will be down as soon as we can said jane but i dare say kitty is	 2.77178937137383
you are rather disposed to call his interference officious	 2.274698902417922
illtreatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite	 3.1200293002917205
we never should have got into the coach i was ready to die of laughter	 3.612465436225728
for charlottes sake she made more favourable than it really was but	 2.139980163352721

elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate	 2.9834185020648305
now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting	 3.2287876369848925
and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent it was for the	 4.0582163017033634
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and	 4.167635375343552
on his account and my nieces it is mr wickhams intention to go	 2.3421781591551043
the letter she found little except the professed affection of the	 2.5274325225147476
very bad it is almost past belief and poor mr darcy dear lizzy only	 2.0845244060865147
manhe is a great friend of darcys	 2.9948328403969664
she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was	 3.2751835257582163
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible advice which there	 3.301001618792588
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful my dear dear	 2.5828692830379625
indeed jane you ought to believe meno one who has ever seen you	 2.383531697211248
when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in	 3.178515400894288
the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged	 2.2909301930473482
she is a very good kind of girl i believe i know no harm of her	 3.2005478832194383
to be described wholly inattentive to her sisters feelings lydia flew	 3.4162839079771956
only four dances i am sorry to pain youbut so it was he danced only	 2.7715709090589344
mrs collins well	 3.066081820493892
very intelligible gallantry	 3.5275085517888933
have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him	 2.896648130291282
as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth warmlyi have spent	 3.0883414725234637
thank you said lydia for if you did i should certainly tell you	 2.4886995389242053
much as possible against mr darcy chose for her employment the	 2.869934520410456
my dear lizzy	 3.0750434898695884
oh but the gentlemen will have mr bingleys chaise to go to meryton	 2.4892716903690006
affair as she wished was excessively disappointed	 2.7026614152170594
interruptions of mr collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with	 4.217038734582271
it is not true a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood	 2.6243291213231683
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him but i	 3.613129728877321
elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was	 2.767768366322262
daughters favour without having paid yourself and mr bennet the	 2.635532201297505
my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in	 3.7913338982322573
of a fine stout healthy love it may every thing nourishes what is	 2.852256842334209
kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours	 3.053268388251887
oh yes you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i	 2.498945373410694
start of the project gutenberg ebook pride and prejudice	 2.433875771412991
when i am in town it is pretty much the same they have each their	 2.2293281242520786
she grew absolutely ashamed of herselfof neither darcy nor wickham	 2.242284685021228
you began the evening well charlotte said mrs bennet with civil	 2.673855946011752
answering immediately to the last questionoh the eldest miss bennet	 2.651637815072626
but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any	 2.967699852960619
reason but your arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation	 3.683792748807493
feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she	 2.831480819869645
nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself as to	 2.3848077360772577
with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike	 2.792047774159129
the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the	 2.5980343841472515
how i long to see her again i never met with anybody who delighted me	 2.4944205652585913
what is it you mean	 2.943064460888815
their attachment but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot	 3.308373633848218
but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult	 2.3241239634588196
elizabeths spirits were so high on the occasion that though she did	 2.5622061390246165
ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship	 3.42876826174994
search of the parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in view	 2.5463353513187004
the carriage was not to be had and as she was no horsewoman walking	 3.342462707210918
engaged to my daughter now what have you to say	 2.5149404004433524
courteous	 2.0190770273117145
different was the effect of a second perusalhow could she deny that	 3.127963556924942
remarked he meant to make enquiries at clapham if he could any how	 2.8871208712991105
and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making	 4.218420052754989
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added how long did you	 2.2795759215947475
as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without losing a	 3.476667266528784
pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of	 3.7197617743192186
the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made	 2.274024609277541
and is this all cried elizabeth i expected at least that the pigs	 2.5274056240061564
elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her very little	 2.960403860656208
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility mr darcy looked	 2.7137391962125266
to continue the london road i know not what to think after making	 2.816146301641742
interest all her tender feelings and nothing therefore remained to be	 2.735974816011764
no want of subjectwe may compare our different opinions	 2.882749025436654
we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure	 3.0707247611478232
glancing over it said in a colder voice	 3.212729164094946
soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet it came	 3.3101620624875063
her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on	 4.1334075819486324
habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five	 2.5947199080835723
enjoyments to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as	 2.7680154943280124
neighbour in her	 3.1173502887159175
enough from my thoughts	 2.8605716778772337
sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the	 2.850650912026426
originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome	 3.3657311300310315
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingleys dislike of her had	 2.419428428280419
likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken	 3.661309829188399
suspicion certainly not in your inclination you may possibly	 2.643501323072971
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers but	 3.6576404231960162
than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable	 3.361894793278649
that kind may befal you you have an affectionate mother who will always	 2.650704473173069
father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they	 2.5093927059579832
chapter v	 1.924954712018208
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the	 4.556570103815298
had a great deal of talk together they met again on sunday and	 2.609619245714146
but it had not been so in derbyshire there he had talked to her	 2.5948967004074945
venture near her lest she might hear too much when they sat down to	 2.5837787881007808
but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be	 2.8990355770849785
it was a fortnight since mrs bennet had been down stairs but on this	 2.6308158738901195
sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of	 3.3426074943189548
being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him	 2.6156655319006856
them indeed excited a lively attention the suspicions which had just	 2.893638897866573
speak she in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydias	 2.791566812336684
him it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we	 3.4899190361604058
and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the	 2.459428449653821
what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters let me take it	 2.307950841175988
little of ones neighbours assistance is impossible condolence	 2.505225334432737
derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no	 2.657979014456464
i will make no promise of the kind	 2.563037815294678
it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be	 3.2798351498416043
think than such as did not	 2.755005440004288
them round the table	 2.9589880295143387
darcy called and was shut up with him several hours it was all	 3.046721682707563
connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy	 2.4215429871023813
on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than	 2.7388521680366296
them as nonsense i cannot quite agree with you there what say you	 2.667577985740353
would happen but who could have foreseen such an attention as this who	 2.843107456764082
to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last	 3.754233976558184
was exactly what darcy had hoped to see they were able to love each	 2.3902803831460746
the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger mrs	 2.6048774992779054
my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong	 2.675807772727004
quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any	 3.546129947017472
perhaps i am not doing her justice but she is very young she has never	 2.793231229222636
between them and if she might judge from his complexion his mind was	 3.1713387096688295
have somebody who thinks of those things where shall you change	 2.6424530188909516
long from my poor mother i am afraid you will not be able to make	 3.2815884351041293
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a	 2.7923599029079544
collected in one individual nor was darcys vindication though	 2.8682946452186044
heavy looking young man of five and twenty his air was grave and	 2.56558413829229
she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy she turned her eyes on the	 3.197175864099601
next morning to her mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for	 2.6061572348738546
because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement	 2.8154400334010896
oh cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted but it is so	 3.9632400742625467
could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydias note to his	 2.5476152065156756
elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath	 3.08221953803846
fruits of her own heinous offence	 3.4163998534756326
of them but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be	 3.9218916276806484
she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which	 3.1149232586957876
elizabeth tried to join in her fathers pleasantry but could only force	 2.8286713444498894
to mrs gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure	 2.7385682852026965
i wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is	 2.4218314923938613
inflicted	 2.0190770273117145
door bell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its	 3.906282416587416
be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of	 3.3694445740829613
after they are married and above all things keep mr bennet from	 2.3110387769096232
by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at	 3.3922393382457785
here again i shall give you painto what degree you only can tell	 2.332165483071982
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project	 3.057930540018983
uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the	 3.2957460736234903
smiles for you are wasting your time with me	 3.2341802486690012
not well enoughyou cannot go yourself	 2.650782422344615
yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension	 2.7037767603874103
man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their	 2.5937666035143527
happiness jane had been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own	 4.782679154455216
immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of	 3.5112170227495687
pitied	 2.0190770273117145
proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for	 2.5398273476911393
have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject	 2.83903723420313
was impossible not to try for information mr darcy had been at her	 2.6993379583288197
instead her liveliness had been never worse timed there was no help	 3.3503237012580604
miserly father and though he belonged to one of the universities he	 3.7784117634067496
too much truth the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no	 2.305037143501488
sister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could	 3.562241241995773
it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire any thing beyond	 3.1093132195043185
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and	 2.819144042312466
presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone while	 3.264740391130044
necessary i hope you have destroyed the letter there was one part	 3.3841325771575153
friend you see by janes account was persuaded of his never intending	 2.2671062864000877
were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i	 2.956491358004795
let mr collins and me have a little conversation together	 2.96099137164562
when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i	 2.660923952598412
and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been	 3.2745008839338348
oh mary said she i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun	 2.5423780391329105
eldest daughter she must just mentionshe felt it incumbent on her	 2.6860848779655657
if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which	 2.698643208881191
was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no	 3.2194793890276143
wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him but though	 3.5401789713586895
such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not	 3.1878502730970504
wanted in the farm mr bennet are not they	 3.7745809363153007
thank you again and again for not going to the lakes how could i	 3.013296146151411

being simply dressed she likes to have the distinction of rank	 4.396572985012114
give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other	 3.6254549571438512
mother could be though in a quieter way elizabeth felt janes	 2.8484164463612394
son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a well known	 3.215031990305489
no my dear i think not i have great hopes of finding him quite the	 2.3752244069875763
she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to	 2.6837876957124243
was not in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it in	 2.9540659657340624
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a few	 2.4696595672514756
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject day after	 2.42648047206646
could not be seen and mr darcy found on further enquiry that	 3.2372580118559227
catherines condescension as he knew not how to admire enough	 3.0667454209785836
mr wickhams society was of material service in dispelling the gloom	 3.8808079101139548
probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak	 3.3079414282873576
increasing	 3.8594932129091992
constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great	 2.7992083717552316
engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the	 3.508164021020585
kitty had not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we	 4.034739421983801
animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and	 2.3670419564809047
goand at another word might stay a month	 2.403260011179464
table for him	 3.1676238596981823
the pianoforte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead	 3.119479367126509
then taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy she left elizabeth to walk	 3.446945164322972
heart did whisper that he had done it for her but it was a hope	 3.627836347504995
horsesoh bromley of courseif you mention my name at the bell	 3.3154640675508187
better that one only of the household and the one whom they could	 3.4617551706471343
grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery	 3.608663087547444
indifference and brevity and the other said no more	 3.6103504786188543
elizabeth asked questions in vain maria would tell her nothing more	 2.3054270943701884
honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on	 2.7934933634225794
instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for	 4.16285007248948
morning to answering it as i foresee that a little writing will	 3.570484568324098
father though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was really	 2.982118869065116
elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books	 2.3448663255714584
would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the	 2.8453861709966506
near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced	 3.4289264088909306
and this said she is the end of all his friends anxious	 2.8099690999888667
cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement when hearing	 3.2416699449092348
the world	 3.3696966252581806
every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the	 2.681042457809873
military library whitehall	 2.6842052643719865
interest but nothing to justify enquiry	 3.476979710619715
openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be	 2.5780392876390645
good lord sir william how can you tell such a storydo not you know	 3.057917195683601
mr collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed	 4.3161234970348925
to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse	 2.988546612157728
disapprobation	 2.0190770273117145
suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly to	 2.4956230922226967
she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley	 2.7164897560064487
give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london	 2.721488165019187
who do you mean my dear i know of nobody that is coming i am sure	 2.690553094292099
lines as for your elizabeths picture you must not attempt to have it	 2.778550265629229
keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition	 3.5582773384425885
soon as she could to the girls who could not listen to their cousin	 3.69671617183229
before not many hours after the express though lydias short	 2.2613040726739704
not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever	 2.6360800422822024
oh papa what news what news have you heard from my uncle	 2.3619779162638648
body for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all	 2.6371451505230503
elizabeths mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after	 4.35850558451661
saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother	 2.80895084911939
respects there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for	 3.7026076201265785
i nor any body can ever forget it is useless to talk of it	 2.8292052431167884
she can have her own waybut i tell you what miss lizzy if you take	 2.685306109718907
intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled i have been a	 3.479307615100949

her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the	 3.3969111837606225
i am now convinced	 3.0787721077843018
that is not very likely our authority was too good	 2.622644056486129
the youngest i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next	 2.6894243827314948
send but even of that they would have been glad to be certain mr	 2.9191307305325416
when mr bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual	 2.7945830119898964
of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the	 3.118275574660236
conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and	 3.206997197861009
where they like	 3.3062348719838823
door jane was at a drawingroom window watching their arrival when	 2.4181678754160325

his partners oh that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance	 4.27348477587858
yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word	 2.303335103522837

carter do not go so often to miss watsons as they did when they first	 2.602982902352497
continued her mother but at the same time mr bingley it is very	 3.063242812722883
not perhaps of neglecting his own interest but of every other neglect	 2.814263087941359
if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often	 3.0877609180229992
the scheme it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at	 2.9789941184150064

her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bingley and the	 3.2272847865507672
feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which	 3.6147526550643208
taken to separate mr bingley and jane she had never doubted but she	 3.7575408261322507
feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his	 3.260813399938289

affection whatever on the occasion mrs bennet could hardly comprehend	 2.7081717479397556

officers of the shire were in general a very creditable	 2.746781256311125
by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she	 3.2050389076560952

reason he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my	 2.93648701461316
that could be so called the respect created by the conviction of his	 2.8764905195612243
dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a	 2.6326736795216634

you doubt me cried jane slightly colouring indeed you have no	 2.9141501202504876

mr collins was punctual to his time and was received with great	 3.3317614981758688
acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was in fact	 2.9803172061869865
the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only	 3.4452947791938535

give which a just sense of shame would not conceal with a strong	 3.4796056810721367
her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined	 2.4745581832339894
upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections or	 3.003501666893532
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly kitty and lydia take	 2.6131897406907507

with my mother up stairs she will be down in a moment i dare say	 2.97830979698036

i do not know when i have been more shocked said she wickham so	 3.1734390669818424

of which we have been advertised by the same authority your daughter	 3.9066780811893116
done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and	 2.8204901396542432
her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy	 2.5267583795182

hour after i had seen you	 2.7098564123795366
questions but answered them very composedlylady catherine then	 2.4064221644751793
fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves	 2.1582619675266885
hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the	 2.93542390376951
hurst and miss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her	 3.292529342105613
leave	 3.8616246451968395
reception mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention he answered	 2.5392681964392847
to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known	 3.3721458214808178
sentimentif you have not been mistaken here i must have	 2.9591136852791755
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that	 3.854047760447772
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford every eye was in	 2.872965254045728
you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr bingley did	 2.5567972742740275
very wellthat reply will do for the presentperhaps by and bye i	 3.3360123682811254
behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest	 3.151839653990041
very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so	 3.143155433825547
do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel lady	 2.6455212618689528
amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no	 3.4429932675035197

dear lizzy	 3.3828290210762666
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for	 2.73480984677946
love	 3.834549504225908
a long dispute followed this declaration but mr bennet was firm it	 3.1177078124040274
i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir such very	 2.5643342504831694
spare from me you are all to come to pemberley at christmas	 2.8127739230847304
cannot afford it and what claims has lydia what attractions has she	 2.9242311466501465
consented as she went up stairs to get ready mrs bennet followed her	 2.4578197769346453
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation	 4.066220612654049
where is your sister said he hastily as he opened the door	 3.1552659713820366
was to admit an idea so destructive of janes happiness and so	 3.169050621406526
him you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence	 3.0956043069831485
assure you it is a pity they are not handsome not that i think	 3.3418784175855434
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character her mind	 3.1597722462273383
yes she did	 3.091570788287143

joke	 2.0190770273117145
been just as likely to marry her had she been his relation	 2.6702706571824053
whom we shall deprive you	 3.050700970311013
to be secure of judging properly at first	 3.8882675474258477
mr darcy took her advice and did finish his letter	 2.4764651718749673
you are uniformly charming cried he with an air of awkward	 2.661401612232402
longbourn mr gardiner was a sensible gentlemanlike man greatly	 2.5721779573776127
arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe	 3.514848964067986
about this report did she call to refuse her consent	 2.8565056627994814
probably notbut mr darcy can please where he chuses he does not	 2.946303510394483
calculation are heavy indeed but perhaps added he stopping in his	 3.032250481811502
of her sisters ready acquiescence	 2.890366107442305
international donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make	 2.4817816283145566
supposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps till the	 2.302117561612035
discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss	 3.827161341187602
review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possible	 3.709685851107145
states compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a	 3.7018319884649897
catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions	 2.6152535824020493
within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so	 2.711684564741472
mary wished to say something very sensible but knew not how	 2.5544319941409874
my dear mr bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome you	 2.5914672305094792
gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the	 3.815766585413337
servants remained but when they had withdrawn he said to her mrs	 2.8785129035171035
not help saying	 3.4246766587814235
find it not equal to lydias for him she had scarcely needed her	 2.7566974679154104
arranging miss de bourghs footstool that she said mr collins you	 3.628718002790862
is miss darcy much grown since the spring said miss bingley will	 3.109017132347652
and lydia used to want to go to london added kitty	 2.562977912139613
substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on	 3.5011387368528717
table what do you think it is excellent news capital news and about	 2.6231692363870125
them would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his	 3.6760364956088036
worth knowing after all	 2.948039946536461
language english	 2.2759724581815157
you are severe on us	 3.4450325594051603
herself in love and to consent to an elopement she was then but	 2.968436554809208
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather	 3.9254282857445055
must be paid within <NUMBER> days following each date on which you	 2.4462987969900234
engagements that had been made for him he had never before supposed	 3.1516774963761978
flirtation and officers have been in her head she has been doing	 2.7928536211698587
vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a	 3.6059266597627517
may often meet again	 2.74281882431556
seemed a gulf impassable between them had lydias marriage been	 3.3490159647768514
brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from that very wish	 2.8843464251391477
la you are so strange but i must tell you how it went off we were	 2.9318591759404216
the compliment of such a mans affection and though her intentions did	 3.231327029172011
removing all my doubts i am not indebted for my present happiness to	 3.675086250072364
in three volumes	 2.750422682966971
and what am i to do on the occasionit seems an hopeless business	 2.782335907366782
that remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than	 3.894569131982679
capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome	 2.6794944392789835
it is from miss bingley said jane and then read it aloud	 2.6351963189767282
appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such	 2.922523253259408
her sisters ruin still more certain and even jane who believed still	 2.429132794136783
taken into the house and as soon as they were in the parlour he	 3.9100557985020576
as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and	 2.953073511043288
consequence of any reply mr collins might never make the offer and	 2.23030927299892
had been taken in thirdly she trusted that they would never be happy	 3.540393403612854
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had	 2.602962128017361
how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his	 2.566338205268416
oh you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general	 2.8682577601674666
engaged with mr darcy that they scarcely ever saw him i found that	 2.5770432456773777
possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every	 2.8394228024126615
when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth	 2.6854139960539367
children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago	 3.2400940750647056
but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object	 2.8567537140623127
bingleys regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the	 2.8794145367125465

elizabeths feelings was every moment increasing she was quite amazed	 2.5995360952914233
recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which	 2.615191379108903
she held out her hand he kissed it with affectionate gallantry though	 3.0196249468833805
ever was seen	 3.2236942106927557
she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell	 3.599797650267447
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of	 3.1902204452687273
janes disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest	 2.636114015440715
beauty mrs long said so too for i asked her whether you did not and	 2.4014681563533045

in meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one	 3.1922735872865986
what could become of mr bingley and jane was a wonder which	 3.099771486943139
is gone down to her uncle at liverpool gone to stay wickham is safe	 2.5284126876519633
sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park	 3.587174423230213
thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate	 2.815661912585302
but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that	 3.208785073110667
very undeserving young manand i do not suppose there is the least	 2.933820558165436
her side but i pity her because she must feel that she has been	 2.814165455784428
of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself	 3.4265376471780264
affectionately taking her hand said in reply	 2.7365791174367162
indeed replied elizabeth i am heartily sorry for him but he has	 3.224729914833383
before anybody else however your coming just at this time is the	 2.383263822749312
so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and	 2.5305417627345794
from his garden mr collins would have led them round his two meadows	 2.3099416053193487
better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning	 3.1024776633587297
elizabeths spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted mr	 3.442556085262595
been in the way of procuring	 3.3936243123379732
colonel fitzwilliam he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man he	 2.352930741753473
all expect janes good fortune	 2.6569269651399865
enough to provoke him elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet was	 4.115857309082513
without one of her sisters	 3.5707562383659486
weeks at rosings and asked him if he were acquainted with the former	 2.6295658632721826
himself and she seized the opportunity of saying	 3.848907670516865
there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel	 2.146307789021196
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must	 3.0763997362484283
mr bingley from your sisterand the other that i had in	 3.1707645694677833
the deficiency of his her father had been an attorney in meryton and	 3.245999468050412
the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would	 2.669188700031898
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you	 3.0047910686808006
aye so it is cried her mother and mrs long does not come back	 2.843786034773093
but consider your daughters only think what an establishment it would	 2.5708699648637015
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state if therefore she	 2.341667033754202
it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion	 2.385284019125646
all to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did	 2.329758040124495
us whether it is like or not	 2.502216841475578
that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass	 2.7018170874960554
returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given	 2.4367105674319802
i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected	 2.412169748826868
my father and maria are to come to me in march added charlotte and	 2.5404360327409887
she were married to him tomorrow i should think she had as good a	 2.4229895524027385
silenced him but he soon afterwards said	 3.0117042134303684
asked for every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left	 2.9322050992511217
if you had rather not	 2.983196766937734
have been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the	 2.4977911107999846
mr darcy is not to be laughed at cried elizabeth that is an	 3.29213506230732
this my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers	 2.775225706516193
guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to	 2.6616850563046976
have thought it and is it really true oh my sweetest lizzy how rich	 2.2091012740316667
various creditors of mr wickham in and near brighton with	 2.917961024528014
verdure of the early trees she was on the point of continuing her walk	 3.5254664358267593
while mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village	 2.5697590877393255
of his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine with less of	 2.633216800822258
a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant	 2.550713228367433
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country it	 2.7208028483725353
	 3.4533322466244982
herself with and one too who had probably been his own companion from	 2.215176100566466
consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no	 4.301024441233204
she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages	 3.2287084267046806
looks sickly and crossyes she will do for him very well she will	 3.541736883898423
disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to	 2.728593936120198
blush he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immoveable from	 2.882352701755226
harmless from all liability costs and expenses including legal fees	 3.9456328027565797
scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir william	 2.647083447756655
elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of	 2.2803512998032818
my own such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might	 3.0468408985020226
unpardonable i cannot think of it without abhorrence	 3.3580148134266583
the first part of mrs gardiners business on her arrival was to	 2.440497014897645
so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will	 2.7671826758828724
fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect	 4.140000366042448
making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally	 2.8674349271436492
house but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the	 2.6595578775084032
mrs gardiner abused her stupidity if it were merely a fine house	 3.1063966556811167
the case	 3.3474485362706825
lord what will become of me i shall go distracted	 2.8302666002919175
comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it	 3.0552720619522558
removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that	 3.865323785870133
serious attachmenti had often seen him in love beforeat that	 2.613179161848644
collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of	 3.304402040772858
impatiently met her at the door of the dressingroom to ask why lady	 3.458763312217583
quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the	 4.072881462421097
in the evening soon after mr bennet withdrew to the library she saw	 3.3532077799911275
about a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject	 3.2946236719299264
dr gregory b newby	 2.5909948420695126
who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the	 2.8931626952935123
composedlylady catherine was a tall large woman with	 2.9556168788753148
and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they	 2.8802330829488234
indeed he has no improper pride he is perfectly amiable you do not	 2.7214141386342035
the scorn	 2.7379969769096206
admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because	 2.59235749456114
attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and	 2.450803777719769
yes she will remain there till christmas	 2.7303062906349473
it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose	 2.4434340637547436
absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that	 2.868622126550278
the effect was immediate a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his	 3.7878442950548523
i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left	 2.528826833744094
thank you for explaining it so fully my faults according to this	 4.247452784999738
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity	 2.870287886546405
punctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a diningroom up	 3.0825936766053905
better mr collins was eloquent in her praise the subject elevated him	 3.4843734137303914
shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by	 2.69995918757388
writer that could give her any comfort miss darcys praise occupied	 2.2139197861359965
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which	 3.798955500696409
such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to	 2.1799610416392166
the objections which had made him prevent his friends marrying her	 2.2504461205592343
i have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him	 2.820106760114932
darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject at	 3.7436763213673774
yes replied wickhamhis estate there is a noble one a clear ten	 2.666744359686153
the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that	 2.9010104437581403
hate you i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take	 2.4632078701931355
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour	 3.187554982054087
i cannot believe it why should they try to influence him they can	 2.223979438758237
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home	 3.2649797999280916
quality or other real or imaginary vanity and pride are different	 2.412939868114258
made an offer to lizzy and she will not have him	 2.911981053716124
would make you sonay were your friend lady catherine to know me i	 2.5565040708497966
approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter	 3.0162477322839303
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry	 2.4069075880652746
mind	 3.455344950466428
find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hatedo not wish me	 2.4082150466057444
mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge where he	 2.6234896037814233
works	 3.77872215408154
indeed without much graciousness but mrs bennet was satisfied and	 2.9477291655483664
elizabeths anger against him had been long done away but had she	 2.375351401706482
good gracious mr darcyand so it does i vow well any friend of	 2.5605015151072585
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the	 3.4391276395056116
mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command	 2.9084874317048
many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few	 2.433215983785592
officers who in comparison with the stranger were become stupid	 2.615665928427653
every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father	 2.1856219247640514
miss elizabeth bennet repeated miss bingley i am all astonishment	 2.5332180284035952
herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to	 4.2383469603254795
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life and where	 2.9899538468416686
mr collinss letter and after laughing at her some time allowed her	 2.9133937547031277
gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off	 2.8233184728111245
extraordinary kindness she was treated with elizabeth silently attended	 3.5562493821522843
listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she	 2.58370852233727
dear lizzy is very great my father and mother believe the worst	 2.436094350902928
imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other	 3.675710750681452
shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well	 2.8086655426459037
regard it that she would never look in it again	 2.9949365977163986
towards mr wickham i know not in what manner under what form of	 2.651830910149818
as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they	 3.9221964916667242
himself to produce a more valuable soninlaw	 3.6807974267708294
it is your turn to say something now mr darcyi talked about	 2.360472345828261
mr bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that	 2.4696263519001245
seriously assured her of its truth	 2.896021881153314
i am sure why janeyou never dropt a word of this you sly thing	 2.599696844634174
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of	 3.8668716212633063
of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished	 2.6020194363942566
certainly not at first but they are very pleasing women when you	 2.6639529944251388
but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i	 2.5904470067059524
no she would go home i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies for	 3.060608694707221
it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant	 2.474929416356303
had allowed her to apply i am confident that she would have performed	 4.352648232043279
at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs hurst and	 2.5385088766826582
acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it were it known to the rest	 2.8239913457876553
longer hope to be benefited by it she wanted to hear of him when there	 3.195870695265208
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her	 2.55297029500403
but you will know it when i have told you what happened the very	 2.473364937895844
next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky	 2.8447125423722435
convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely	 3.574720749937154
bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with	 2.335445510362522
laughingly answered	 3.2589433054987396
choice the next morning however made an alteration for in a quarter	 2.9874236331558777
chapter xiv	 1.924954712018208
when they parted lady catherine with great condescension wished them	 2.6660288712331677
it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been things	 2.558283059719408
lovely and amiable when darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley	 3.388044536477246
mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a	 3.9762158601049364
herthese are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and	 2.5950098501191423
any beauty in her her face is too thin her complexion has no	 2.7175072630859134
well oh that i had been with you you have had every care and anxiety	 2.810301212400667
elsewhere	 2.0190770273117145
family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but	 3.2110851147763935
that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be	 2.6079402647833945
eminent physicians this she would not hear of but she was not so	 3.570797951961386
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good	 2.289533566097359
congratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly	 2.402017545201484
parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of	 3.087317339675127
gbnewby<MENTION>	 2.0190770273117145
and i have another favour to ask will you come and see me	 2.468977710998321
dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading	 2.343603251263153
tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor she was	 2.4268735415305613
every body hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them	 2.7051227737068477
allwhat all five out at once very oddand you only the	 2.260955005508512
perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had	 2.8846789831955766
gallery mrs reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his	 2.7459770190244
child and now heres mr bennet gone away and i know he will fight	 2.7664681915533875
as these but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the	 3.084171073901987
well lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so the	 2.404857809619588
accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as i am	 2.997454516791234
became by proper attention and management less irritable less	 2.627958869807239
look into the park the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had	 2.549733503590438
communicativeness by his questions and remarks mrs reynolds either	 3.080793835945928
unwilling to comply with their brothers proposal and it was settled	 3.2940127828800025
it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way	 2.521133247179857
elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude	 2.8228215805803347
you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your	 2.684885812000038
haste and come down this moment	 2.7032640366435734
entered the breakfastroom and congratulated both him and herself in	 3.688353907537207
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth	 3.8179345299168768
the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for	 3.0594388808806934
rapturous air the fine proportion and finished ornaments they followed	 3.4782984045362295
bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life she	 2.6240855047615423
one morning about a week after bingleys engagement with jane had been	 2.46777233088624

i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza	 2.425758191957589

visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his	 2.752009898697523

considered it as the deathwarrant of all possibility of common sense	 3.3128982988927445
unpardonable in me	 3.2110306686147427

their father from a different quarter from mr collins which as jane	 2.6909424741506354

from mr collins and what can he have to say	 3.2784478884348025
having passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his first	 2.8773184486709513
hereafter her own he had certainly formed such a plan and without	 2.3439882891417088

in darcys breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her	 2.762291021869062

her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her	 3.234587629498374
thank youbut i always mend my own	 2.888474551620318

is this a hint to me lizzy said her father to send for the	 3.146154932674649
for fifty pounds no kitty i have at last learnt to be cautious and	 2.576262203854015

and jane and for their sakes had patience with her mr darcy was	 4.281088097664566
how good it was in you my dear mr bennet but i knew i should	 2.8637601849733514
like manner sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on	 2.1938538058965062
your situation with much compassion	 2.6481575695476227
but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four	 2.2360944561368123
lizzy my dear i want to speak with you	 3.2623500464966573

have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the	 2.9162227268482885
elizabeth had settled it that mr darcy would bring his sister to visit	 2.6770530282791136
she wished they might be happy thursday was to be the wedding day	 2.98002021895005

mr bennets expectations were fully answered his cousin was as absurd	 2.9079070361596138
wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for	 2.6048415827411144

you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my	 2.660725983825277

readiness and ease of a wellbred man and talked very pleasantly but	 3.1037641733990005

the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the	 3.2162866150832174

had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and	 4.210828998990274
must own that she was tired of great houses after going over so many	 2.878096238088509
it may do very well for the others replied mr bingley but i am	 2.5471166539142684

they then sat down and when her enquiries after rosings were made	 2.4345020278546037
be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself	 3.072670210874728
the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of	 2.578754672598768
and thither also went mr wickham undoubtedly by design for there	 2.388553600278426

in as short a time as mr collinss long speeches would allow every	 2.255229061906419
defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity	 3.784024301948765
very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour	 2.7668286700072082

while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on any one else	 2.83491306559582
give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of	 3.2328374050488224

not the smallest hope it is every way horrible	 2.750815316855709
at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such	 2.9073482786810847
that she might have been mr collinss wife by this time had not it	 2.900436053310353

did whether he would think it proper to join in the evenings	 2.7641790214120974

to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on	 3.7332431338449195
though we know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she	 2.436468351312692
silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her mr	 3.8479867669521335
his while among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a	 2.828441170484065
curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingleys in spite of the	 2.6098641726352714
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen	 2.921202813119756
mr and mrs gardiner smiled elizabeth could not help saying it is	 2.9657764812100784

the idea she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her	 2.680122009118537

all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs	 2.489444764491778
i am not likely to leave kent for some time promise me therefore to	 2.5190558908870173
me i confessfor certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to	 2.6885704147877747
the compliment you are paying me i am very sensible of the honour of	 3.4944970385063896
times widely different when she remembered the style of his address	 3.8857783769591974
let her be called down she shall hear my opinion	 2.3402519731938125

advantage she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but	 3.425521682485462
they were all astonished and mr bennet who could by no means wish for	 2.9187246750338987
damage	 2.0190770273117145
situation and temper consider mr collinss respectability and	 2.6793059835223283
claimed their relationship would have delighted them all elizabeth had	 2.3088693822973996
made by the latter it had not been very great he had lost every point	 2.6215674741698733
one and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived	 2.663618682645699
are you not diverted	 3.008336274094931
yes my youngest is not sixteen perhaps she is full young to be much	 2.366533755437326

neighbourhoods larger i know we dine with four and twenty families	 2.5425344958808553
for the night and mrs bennet with great politeness and cordiality said	 2.8155968794495836
that is as it happens it does not necessarily follow that a deep	 2.9528562852638376
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by	 2.679700620101381
unsuitable a match the strangeness of mr collinss making two offers	 3.3844123950556257
mr bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued	 2.434397703221296

any thing about it they found at last on examining their watches that	 2.9017632221909566
would be wisdom to resist all that i can promise you therefore is not	 3.4784529725132995

i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen	 2.7531994795873693

happened to see her there	 3.47518954129512
not a word after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an	 2.355658044037283
hardheartedness in any of the family	 3.7719324175984927
and intelligence which might supply it among themselves if there were	 2.334258797299694

from the former i had narrowly observed her during the two visits	 2.5944311424892974
in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to	 2.3358065761946083

perhaps i do arguments are too much like disputes if you and miss	 2.8575280861569117

you are all kindness madam but i believe we must abide by our	 2.684638312549398

as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think	 2.268886104999829
could be benefited by such a belief as this for were i persuaded that	 2.8501049541675196
may convince you of its being one	 3.433547422396675

explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give	 3.210583668559933
to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her	 2.9614009207346337
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined with amazement did	 3.2903269809266367

while she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to	 2.322961682855831

not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage	 2.10854030951369
very well we now come to the point your mother insists upon your	 2.5056760505925544

first you may remember	 2.8390228213265485
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other	 2.760400945504721
she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to	 2.6053093020576332
moment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly	 2.4644046762007132
increased by every review of it that she should receive an offer of	 3.263213304169472
he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading	 3.40378380081899

much as possible here leading the way through every walk and cross	 2.379404624329357

friends why could not he keep on quarrelling with you as his father	 2.4661613402533438
thought the same and added	 2.9151238408300837
doubt of my reception you shewed me how insufficient were all my	 3.492551835928491
my spirits will not bear solitude i must have employment and society	 2.970853081318455
into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking	 2.4895841497480498
the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a	 3.0197542704912435
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation	 2.7838025021370156
but not before they went to brighton	 2.66646086585779
the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just	 2.283865648212755
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so	 2.883254278756444
writing i would not give up mr collinss correspondence for any	 3.128281031926304
my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncles	 2.3946621100440812
good deal the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are	 2.668759289878776
unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the	 2.475786598420832

found that jane had no intelligence to give the sanguine hope of good	 2.638837254656714
urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly to receive her	 3.451880999196659
ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening	 4.780794078312941
concealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject	 2.4266225851822134
her praise of mr bingley before expressed to her sister how very much	 2.7527333248137387
actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to	 3.0948717009554203
two days after mr bennets return as jane and elizabeth were walking	 2.5420427275729907
he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his	 3.896363933754934
occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man	 3.8117917203546567
placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable she	 2.9211750755651407
repinebut to be sure it would have been such a thing for me the	 3.1037337541964614
brother is the cause of it i need not explain myself farther and	 2.6815855233110426
access to the full project gutenbergtm license must appear prominently	 2.702539142119354
this is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me a	 2.264010495348648
and do you really know all this cried mrs gardiner whose curiosity	 2.398942718583728
of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern	 2.6999334208079975
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1e<NUMBER> with	 3.083622786526165
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations	 3.028323360046344
mrs bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to	 2.8290473261650257
of a good fortune must be in want of a wife	 2.5275841347972876
marry and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had	 3.9248439496147722
himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain	 2.595316571510598
circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among	 2.913366657179119
discussed that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking mr	 3.529016323961055
thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of	 4.1617985918989975
ambition will ever be gratified i came to try you i hoped to find you	 2.3010893710003586
heard his claims on mr darcy and all that he had suffered from him	 4.293761372913038
done she had a less active part to play it became her turn to listen	 2.4691665731107992
you go to brightoni would not trust you so near it as east bourne	 2.7908983254842457
wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the	 2.2646137545324128
intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance	 2.718086635221023
in three volumes	 2.750422682966971
frequently recurring the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters	 3.5196071967702447
that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be	 2.981479205503616
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word after a short pause	 3.061607048432718
than yourself or jane at most you know pretty well i suppose	 2.172327346037942
did not know him in the least lord how i laughed and so did mrs	 3.2834773634852543
mr wickhams adieus were much more affectionate than his wifes he	 2.6814599222298456
most creditable to his heart i am sincerely grieved for him and	 4.725817489675612
significant look and smile from mrs annesley to miss darcy had been	 2.8909201695924285
half an hours quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join	 3.3676328079054345
elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to	 2.675807400259651
said	 3.777493958538712
formerly have rejoiced in its termination	 3.6046007085002776
spirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which they	 2.5056625909523143
he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a	 3.241240657170483
suppose as my dear charlotte informs me that this licentiousness	 2.877714208019048
because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it yes miss	 3.0978263085717277
such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to	 2.5902729494666366
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised	 2.880704898379854
neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown and even when it	 2.9588299424948548
had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after	 2.419765739173891
listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all	 2.875970119080069
him replied the other elizabeth thought this was going pretty far	 2.3236030170880495
me we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our	 3.012785286778617
be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling	 2.6018992430210095
bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and mr bennet spent the	 4.267985897759319
minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to	 3.5672291864608376
we never had any governess	 3.293374222520179
cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its	 2.505221352660718
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickham has created a	 3.3226057627277075
who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the	 2.618450891700226
these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth but the wife of mr	 3.0756345520285095
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps he addressed	 3.276498832620786
sincerely wish him happy	 2.9333174551431433
often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my	 4.247142450402739
may i ask to what these questions tend	 2.4400063055348693
relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore	 3.3176173095427792
no but it must be done soon	 3.19339523673766
this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss	 2.3795051343368057
wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were	 3.0598353280374564
without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing	 2.3802698106722366
be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance i dearly love a	 2.3616309648283016
anything	 2.0190770273117145
sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case	 2.928360767283774
darcy had walked away to another part of the room she followed him with	 2.9543674421406334
her and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte	 3.649581304069017
probability of a rainy season made her feel that the commonest	 3.3911009459937174
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his	 3.9056666525718895
she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to	 3.427386833356353
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly it had given him a	 2.6314418712173846
he looked surprised displeased alarmed but with a moments	 3.219233006202904
wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his	 3.241600705645281
pemberley property he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy a most	 3.0257107169630046
mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation	 3.381896164101301
you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of	 2.87507185980005
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on	 4.504914498792114
miss bennet i am shocked and astonished i expected to find a more	 2.799492174721531
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after	 2.5992808411004833
