first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the	 2.372090840460472

nothing more to plague her on his account	 3.913423928959191
to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many	 3.3792758611883698
to be secure of judging properly at first	 4.8973373220649234
sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon	 2.720596938945227
the country at present a few weeks he believed	 2.6791217184607348
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his	 3.996105005745191
philipss manners and politeness he protested that except lady	 2.692303165937
mrs bennet and mrs philips was an amiable intelligent elegant	 2.8104300612445696
given to remind her of her post there was now employment for the whole	 5.34281488199579

his coming i am glad he dines here on tuesday it will then be publicly	 2.606775164428089
a haunch the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the	 3.37554509141829
at whist enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearing	 5.010834921789817
to driving him out in his gig and shewing him the country but when he	 3.8921211493957046
if he had had any compassion for me cried her husband impatiently	 2.544369236314783
other engagements might allow him to visit them	 2.6628860455939973
i honour your circumspection a fortnights acquaintance is certainly	 3.2557064364409833
she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in	 2.3795311907055914
diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty and	 2.860868099120874
misrepresented	 1.9905095457977273
regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my	 2.175924310347296
she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself and to	 2.6868017449278248
my cousin elizabeth	 3.0863814246521697
be the world has been deceived in that respect and i am happy to	 2.620983556390957
thing rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory	 3.6373308206693453
i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they	 2.3471350533564856
admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because	 2.673030656984155
all means to refuse him	 3.335072770907107
in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the	 2.5831126416763985
mrs hurst was observing their game	 2.504845337281548
again in ten minutes time and then we all set out however i	 2.3776453649344207
himself without disguise	 3.093628129538564
elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more mrs	 3.8300319536000087
that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your	 3.3364824178584986
esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met	 2.7690325418242163
to the scheme	 3.1492983876152647
way and after a moments pause added	 2.8355045909047427
sister ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to	 3.036885179225375
forgiveness the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlottes	 2.7952306335226456
mother you quite mistook mr darcy he only meant that there were not	 2.876736870942994
before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling they	 3.6880229241893345
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation	 2.756843481213771
are your uncles and aunts do not imagine me ignorant of their	 2.6515882116140506
may like to have her own way	 3.0754997234702053

table for him	 3.169313926030708
hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls though	 2.9574505932563064
he is gone i never saw such a long chin in my life well but now for	 2.8022790676117557
tenderly she even shook hands with the formerelizabeth took leave of	 3.0564392933216404
reserve and want of proper consideration that wickhams character	 2.2676568927845104
you look as if you did not care about me	 2.617537552172548
and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump but	 3.579442528068158
ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr	 4.1321876531610195
sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the	 2.446830320375318
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the	 2.8674959771446282

the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her	 2.6737129503666734

either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object it	 2.292372730540577
you are then resolved to have him	 2.5894273740308402
confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due	 2.9634836782427256
chapter xiv	 1.9484968389608204
was less difficult to develope she was a woman of mean understanding	 3.289438288306474
sincerely wish him happy	 2.9383938530645164
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds	 2.7231048104421047
you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her allow me by the	 2.437023083829781
elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately miss bingley	 2.4306502856438295
kind	 3.8004500354170587
transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were	 3.582095029382466
body too who is likely to know	 2.705566183300867
say there will be some little money even when all his debts are	 2.6534460395780335
works based on the work as long as all references to project gutenberg	 3.084451524222137
mother you deserve no such attention i am most seriously displeased	 2.284631371951268
concealment this disguise was beneath meit is done however	 4.308006276690373
and disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know what to say to	 3.5293156803681685
the charge of her but i was overruled as i always am poor dear	 3.148693119493826
money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared	 2.238235076438227
encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed onas to	 2.6527146383211906
suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables	 3.3050045517276194
united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a	 2.922446702022838
forit is i believe too little yieldingcertainly too little for the	 2.5314895507512754
i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of	 2.6967470531195983
the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often	 2.453231617289723
accomplishedshe plays and sings all day long in the next room is a	 2.8875399780666906
and mrs collinss happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her	 2.6931702090597693
the next moment open the front door and quit the house	 2.965660305620811
able to see your friends before they leave the country but may we not	 2.277401161933019
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no	 2.946496479847894
and then we were so merry all the way home we talked and laughed so	 2.893972963969869
do not you want to know who has taken it cried his wife impatiently	 2.596322657942108
refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom	 2.8661265944156247
and of this place thought she i might have been mistress with	 3.139156664219337
elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse	 3.249505925921673
your attendance upon her has been too much for you you do not look	 2.9116158201038362
she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton	 2.6852552431507997
extraordinary in them they have a sharp shrewish look which i do not	 3.3275533006850546
by mrs collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter	 2.628049947668859
at least it shews that she was serious in the object of her journey	 3.3344700065052275
journey and brought its master back to longbourn	 2.4346254895157364
their attachment but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot	 3.3417329318283855
service is over i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will	 2.4464196922228165
me and teach you not to believe a word i say i am particularly unlucky	 2.6346411942235908
its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means	 3.281494494195492
only think of its being three months she cried since i went away	 2.5670047673978513
jane make haste and tell us make haste my love	 2.792483019328968
for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham i longed to	 2.3887510819894207
lizzy i never gave you an account of my wedding i believe you were	 2.4301221054799265
the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess after	 4.4572846719710775

great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the	 3.8070338569165068
i never can be thankful mr bennet for any thing about the entail	 3.4033605686097164

impossible no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his	 2.9221308781973723
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy she had been unwilling to	 4.708371564550946
been the case	 3.2177031453124414
elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them an hasty kiss	 2.7627766165685155

elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for	 2.728129336784672
mrs bennet who quarrelled with no compliments answered most readily	 2.7556526798119996
and have you heard from him often	 2.6463922365781496
however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together	 2.414224133566401
i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more	 2.5140530856316254

expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for	 3.3902454862144005
all and then wickham would be angry	 2.5511615757102257
so long in one attitude	 3.194334880701253
abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most	 3.4512216373556246
are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when	 2.8270380888759896
for it however mr wickhams happiness and her own was per force	 2.7829389760915197
as they concerned george wickham what a stroke was this for poor jane	 2.6215334105383894
saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at	 4.2114518270372825
darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from	 3.2809365966310575
hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the	 2.939753108356837
seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at	 3.0327533374140594
my part mr bingley i always keep servants that can do their own	 2.1678691438011244
withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for	 3.872838221164933
requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing	 2.8810286647620287
are my old friends i have heard you mention them with consideration	 2.3661760913752063
dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken almost as	 2.2728223986489184
out of the room as they went down stairs together charlotte said	 2.6502743352283744
foundation	 3.8371929038581705
conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage	 3.9716413310877283
received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia at first there	 2.4375113704099864
comfort was that mr bingley must be down again in the summer	 2.6335348235449496
it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said	 2.908370074432826
the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not	 2.3060320407399084
than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such	 3.0018116290452226

all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day	 2.1707825289206317
elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those	 3.059143064209179
out that mrs collinss joints of meat were too large for her family	 3.082251870055824
spirits and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had	 2.987143912079149
his sister it is really too distressing i am sure you must feel it	 3.012065834754007
mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in	 2.9413702720431836
took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and	 2.545134287405578
it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married	 2.8796592861816768
darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her how could	 2.811439522281567
as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits	 2.959832495689548
performed in a proper manner without any of those apologies and thanks	 2.716388478636927
it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that	 2.6936391857115667
former prejudices had been removed	 3.4133890312574784
would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur	 2.9813565958165813

before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part	 2.350855098358804
elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection	 2.7821995733103244
library to write and the girls walked into the breakfastroom	 2.76346230572587
contrivance breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield	 2.274744231084348
enough for expectation	 3.080591885574056
notice the two first dances however brought a return of distress	 2.3167029801317436
this will not do said elizabeth you never will be able to make both	 2.705107228046486
and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother said mr gardiner	 2.5400675001253354
injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady	 3.1356757454816564
in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant	 3.201614121430061

with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held	 3.187440440495297

of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse any thing which he	 2.614363947283802
received and noticed as he was perhaps there was some truth in	 3.0783540475970144
of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss	 2.2884346004594147
remember that four evenings have been also spent togetherand four	 2.6304806845997057
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance to	 3.353475508800954
hard to have her taken such a way from me they are gone down to	 2.521264817743939

i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham i can	 2.9944577692344208
i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever	 2.482818036131281
by this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried	 2.6343475135478385
very little of his time there in future he has many friends and he is	 2.336708381322783
every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world and	 3.5386024677317165
for good news the letter was read aloud mrs bennet could hardly	 2.436683533303919
well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never	 2.4784625761198953
deserve	 1.9905095457977273
dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all	 4.746489807734374
concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally	 2.304326934540752
for ever	 3.3055644317131687
eat drink and play at cards who when he found her prefer a plain dish	 2.5889995507067596
omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected	 2.6175211296518164
she was shewn into the breakfastparlour where all but jane were	 3.2940610734481677
or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she	 3.103140798987779

it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their	 2.8188755964127603
i have heard much of your masters fine person said mrs gardiner	 2.851840741602787
out well at such a distance as that you know things are strangely	 2.472532132223556
mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of	 2.9672604233535353
on one side of your lawn i should be glad to take a turn in it if you	 3.2064230237464506
by exclamations and inquiries about the other of whom however she	 3.8165032565003276
when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant	 2.355319820716722
fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished since her	 3.191755527995729
opportunity	 3.774954840669367

dear madam cried mrs hill in great astonishment dont you know	 2.708657100668849
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former	 3.815807221361437
particulars it is not fair to condemn him it is not to be supposed	 4.0776090965762934
her with his best respects to all her family not forgetting his thanks	 2.9528018453521834
very strenuously have opposed it you ought certainly to forgive them as	 3.462892643156021
voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to	 3.3471933354710792
masterly manner which i see so many womens do they have not the same	 2.6486843657300065
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on	 4.4342067249192105
your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in	 2.2233957027247193
add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by	 3.820730554716125
to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is	 2.124073572845754
his father miss bennet the late mr darcy was one of the best men	 3.089977482481965

sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeableallowing	 3.594192991207656
collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much	 3.1169991213054087
yes and i had heard it before but what is that to me if there is no	 2.8490520083315345

i have seen nothing of it	 2.772566275118224
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of	 2.5787210571512538
that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly	 2.743032619501925
right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older	 2.3785472015352678

miss bennet do you know who i am i have not been accustomed to such	 3.3438403354098827
natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings she was	 2.2649224371673866
opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily	 2.627098031437515
dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way but	 3.1242766002774642
and at length by repeated assurances that mr darcy was really the	 3.024380217341528
at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often	 3.9904163904161685
honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty	 3.558481288943259

reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at	 2.925704978393292
before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in	 2.7801468755951837
sisters mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man i am	 3.0195200581528785
reserve and caprice that the experience of three and twenty years had	 3.517726252208488
wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark	 4.764373568713942
his plan did not vary on seeing themmiss bennets lovely face	 3.04452266567578
you already use to calculate your applicable taxes the fee is	 4.032146808623778
two days after mr bennets return as jane and elizabeth were walking	 2.5135177641499764
that he was asking some odd unconnected questionsabout her pleasure in	 3.986219112585309
lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me how little did you	 3.168938844372239
appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such	 2.837873252133264
conversation in which she had no sharelouisa you will not mind my	 3.833827258800969
almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to	 2.3361414283493995
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would	 2.4516985244394367
exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given	 3.31665546508943
the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged	 2.2895287249905083
than when they last met were plainly expressed she was disappointed	 2.3707155058294327
and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful	 3.403787339427942
as i sit by the fire	 2.895779121797006
pleasantry her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in	 2.515185868721222
i know them a little their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike	 2.5108815606318116
an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not	 3.2268773028341697
and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i	 3.8778422346300827
but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing they have	 2.291754059088642
it places mr darcy to be treating his fathers favourite in such a	 3.4836303557288653
all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her	 3.472979706373195
elizabeth longed to observe that mr bingley had been a most delightful	 4.166273635049043
his side even more his present pursuit could not make him forget that	 2.691176061203543
any thing about it they found at last on examining their watches that	 2.8622766429479496
know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a	 3.3611633784402715

object of prey to any body at brighton she will be of less importance	 3.2176769139550663
in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses i dare say the	 2.889915941235647
not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his	 2.9024684192818326

from all the others when they sat down to table she had only to say in	 2.679499660344082
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with	 2.427072400968289
assurance i require	 3.3881459526214988
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless	 3.085542023769774

it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the	 2.384090265039621
very intelligible gallantry	 3.361641123060604
enough to say before how much i like him his behaviour to us has	 2.590688912524765

i dare say you will find him very agreeable	 2.9122712386978495
miss bennet i am shocked and astonished i expected to find a more	 2.8452503719404714

there can be no doubt of that it is settled between us already that	 2.7747006180973943
feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in	 4.246208280373963
a little more liveliness and that if he marry prudently his	 3.2886271926933133

could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the	 2.4431436783317557
construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor	 2.906232750057977
as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned	 2.8876556271912124
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward as all	 3.257812568379514
set out to meet him accidentally in the lane but little had she dared	 3.2915594259277485
they had often attempted it before but it was a subject on which mrs	 3.0253102320435312
utterly unknown to her before something he supposed might be attributed	 2.89090085112863
a novelty to them the party did not supply much conversation elizabeth	 3.427082189648669
certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but	 3.2707024151288095
what had since passed to provoke her she lost all concern for him in	 2.784963046542478
against the temptation of immediate relief they met several times	 3.1680854971994576
might lead to the mention of her had he dared he observed to her at a	 2.967503951225557

solicitude they shewed for jane the apothecary came and having	 2.930014440464005

whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his	 2.896016380071916
custom and mary went up stairs to her instrument two obstacles of the	 2.876642363465224

you will feel the effects of it no officer is ever to enter my house	 3.1182046666837686

chapter xvii	 1.9484968389608204
considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least	 3.246218413343131

she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth perhaps she	 2.670212438008032
happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they	 3.3110867399319317

overtaken by wickham	 3.052505049443958
he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all	 2.993204425470323
saw him so affected poor kitty has anger for having concealed	 2.1979311075346435
very young woman and very lately married a resemblance in good humour	 3.016622518477168
through her mothers hands lydias expences had been very little within	 2.9202819379050777

after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two	 3.2579598156731757

i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend	 3.1780547624265463
mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while	 3.120647486950377
they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them	 3.3851721173648297
would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been	 2.5717801347556626
stiffness of manner and resentful silence he scarcely ever spoke to	 2.4076712666547677

raptures as mr collins expected the scene to inspire and was but	 3.0745847735507525
but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i	 2.5666934315756773

were by themselves how strange this is and for this we are to be	 2.5194552615164856

i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy	 2.6122268842734444

something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty as	 3.7928685204332147
and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly	 2.309676232901996

of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man i would	 4.926443152076437
it is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patience	 2.7952076701577964

address most truly the gentleman mr darcy looked just as he had been	 2.9679532926867354
of all that she had heard it was not to be supposed that any other	 3.2827047339876554
application and elegance as you describe united	 3.854342021889054
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing	 3.197441929342681

about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i	 2.153978085765675
should ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia	 2.7425880980602004

themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the	 2.83902955175009
as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no	 2.129394545656362
better things let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor	 3.565399362878288

thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me	 2.5468611619043644
other provocations you know i have had not my own feelings decided	 3.0511895737738706
acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming	 3.0777524978437767
persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town	 3.0014055448555905
perfect as plan could be	 2.746934207382691
if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley it	 3.5116860768664555
since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of	 2.1429470580553196
on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and	 4.015901483519207
she were married to him tomorrow i should think she had as good a	 2.4815609063656807
so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will	 2.724781852843144
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand jane now came up	 2.8659100701161084
be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling	 2.3375514537207
one of the windows	 3.1143370065434532
spoke she would have quitted the room had not mr collins thus	 3.350529663372655
and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect	 3.3195965265154945
forget it ourselves they were off saturday night about twelve as	 2.7784573303822504
relieved by discerning such different feelings	 2.835383823343627
distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at	 4.701484407869631
about it and to ask when mr denny comes back from town	 2.349336855116254
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had	 2.499941585618611
all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister	 2.700263544785828
the will the difference was great what wickham had said of the living	 2.7923579187872076
disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind	 4.26828738957447
required a thousand things may arise in six months	 3.298474161810407
felt a wish of enquiring his countenance voice and manner had	 3.1056459644549865
silence on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for	 2.445041425501446
saturday and to saturday he still meant to stay	 2.4166728120370116
that parish and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven	 2.7248945234778383
happy with him	 3.3530522858518417
her twice only think of that my dear he actually danced with her	 2.5149765206864028
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively	 2.6256454151153243
pleasanter aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent	 2.775592735942483
rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to	 2.610510949631385
my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for	 2.6219503995898226
insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of	 3.733807560112187
sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks though her manner	 3.658406423330318
lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat	 2.9611363976027913
you must acknowledge to be true	 4.07345921177985
were particularly intimate sir william lucas had been formerly in trade	 3.4531782868521756

i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth but i do not	 2.865236857253237
health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better	 2.6815586860856087
work b alteration modification or additions or deletions to any	 4.996734957582689
likes with her	 3.0981342900280615
ladies were ready enough to talk and mr collins seemed neither in need	 2.6631220427993356
she is grown so brown and coarse louisa and i were agreeing that we	 4.805887478273383
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth	 3.7218963183884783
take us all there for the summer it would be such a delicious scheme	 3.145179378026245

opened by a servant and mr darcy appeared her pale face and impetuous	 2.6058183511461612
but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by not	 2.6693729394639254
and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs bennets	 3.815983708428818
as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution from	 3.3100528035812555
doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it	 2.421228486981991
if i were you	 3.0884134461658435
you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings	 2.8044330458719204
collins then returned to elizabeth	 2.796628657282954
moved mr jones says we must not think of moving her we must trespass	 3.3034071975306496
which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the	 3.6946067449137674
they were of course all intending to be surprised but their	 3.5759022468151906
piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no	 2.4399687693408714
i assure you the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw the	 2.490029973984283
wednesday and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be	 3.494399385540286
bingley if she could but lizzy oh sister it is very hard to think	 2.4594055832440715
how hard it is in some cases to be believed	 3.4869051019563204
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the	 2.4419527650184905
to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and	 2.9782590852622017
dear sir	 3.062651138379224
always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he told	 2.9178404177795705
excuse me when he knows all and tell him i will dance with him at	 2.816856253731747
the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always	 2.747062564967228
dancing and his partner	 2.9353980394593107
but i cannot think so ill of him many circumstances might make it	 2.5704088661444384
sometimes one must speak a little you know it would look odd to be	 2.5159879731946617
part of our youth was passed together inmates of the same house	 3.334300291902151
would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the	 2.834619337274099

as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive	 3.582963023061745
did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him	 2.465003513710307
almost every day they called at various times of the morning sometimes	 2.4778354205302286
dullest most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the	 3.2790298189805904
last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy	 3.0209239528025273
refinements of polished societies	 2.712712209444748
she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening	 2.9881929903565756
favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress	 2.876276887900986
thing but himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs gardiner	 3.019764566102496
hour was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied	 2.6846577260285374
bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of	 2.774361796582556
it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who	 2.8675170521252387
messages to his sister mr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet and	 2.9499058417264186
know his real character	 3.045001652523506
the good news quickly spread through the house and with proportionate	 3.2200365133490636
too full of lines under the words to be made public	 2.810981317585696
i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a design of	 2.218789736697611
his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to	 2.7339173284579266
favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a	 2.3797434557097445
friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two but	 2.5412905360470077
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn	 3.0282679629192213
have been a daily witness of and altogether i trust it does not appear	 3.9324402986705307
she will drop the acquaintance entirely	 3.6307298972698865
fitzwilliam and myself about a year ago she was taken from	 2.3881417969362717

attribute in some measure to jealousy had the late mr darcy liked me	 3.2052250008779817
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away	 3.1880877268679653
asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm while mrs reynolds	 2.4883728247468153
over the mantlepiece her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it	 2.9896107751769487
opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody	 4.198041190513716
in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her	 2.312862936996243
children was so highly reprehensible but she had never felt so	 3.2422557382329518
unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary	 2.5372983288717306
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf	 4.077695545143342
if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often	 2.9968901903539127

you are quite right to have his errors made public might ruin him for	 2.5442386830844534
unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be	 2.1792489470104828
that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her	 2.4544640743425146
then said	 3.387034815247819

at length the chaise arrived the trunks were fastened on the parcels	 3.047761543390074
which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure i	 2.4637361914733003
surprise his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of	 2.6645582340586706
the praise where it was due but lizzy this must go no farther	 2.966153776671563
she believed he might have the best informed mind	 3.1873190736988737
affectionately taking her hand said in reply	 2.7402390546305875

he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation	 4.117169330246893
mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he	 2.4724817123789395
in spite of having been at st jamess sir william was so completely	 3.2447801369797196
recommend his suit	 2.8585608834573213
struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing and called out to	 3.433333471692355
her sister her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore to	 2.854534393306133
door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she	 2.739968667590374
elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table	 2.8381336246468964
all worth pleasing so high and so conceited that there was no enduring	 3.0358165903976175
i did hear too that there was a time when sermonmaking was not so	 3.248166808268225
me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i	 3.1081584077722444
mr bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way you take	 2.860822056284944

she when he knows who they are he takes them now for people of	 2.521079699999944
well mamma said she when they were all returned to the breakfast	 3.282339873888537
by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say mr darcy	 2.208326177617407
intimation of her knowing her master	 2.8410859446641408
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement there are a few	 3.411101518723116
she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as	 2.7669038456503228
a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if	 3.3610040743691227
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she	 3.8292881197693625
heard the good news miss lydia is going to be married and you shall	 2.663022942178801
how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from	 3.5652418567840374
did you admire me for my impertinence	 2.7271634843977304
no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former	 3.5272585839460517
consider how important every moment is in such a case	 2.8866024403145842
came she sees them now very often standing in clarkes library	 2.428972842919459
him more favourably spoken of by any one	 2.634372326270229
to me i should not have been allowed to invite them	 3.4574280719848347
you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer	 2.5083389214488463
uncommonly pretty	 3.282412247317567
effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country	 2.272053497512077
neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth have any	 2.2870829401476684
mothers rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated	 4.48466252819259
removal was soon evident lady catherine had been rendered so	 2.334151477697811
he is indeedbut considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we	 3.1066300669645934
him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good	 3.0873968552833286
you begin said she i can comprehend your going on charmingly when	 2.5259130586760743
evenings scrutiny that though she received his attentions with	 2.6276955410996914
will drink to our good journey	 3.0706005005102086
were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them if youll believe	 3.0350615346460064
not one of them i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good follies	 3.014618917099936
welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smile to	 2.485274892199779
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as	 2.2268150904660784
bingley	 3.226782912389536
her being rather tannedno miraculous consequence of travelling in the	 3.0947586519868295
for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it	 2.8215598825023362
perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better	 2.1327666329764443
agitation gave more important intelligence it was to this effect	 2.7707234845404374
i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole	 2.3958188730318564
gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her	 3.5113724443149428
down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much	 3.015903958243385
with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she	 2.3029554444982288
right my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how	 2.5678873659412282
in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of	 2.4909030880025664
my part except the shops and public places the country is a vast deal	 3.2787534108933802
mothers permission for this address you can hardly doubt the purport	 2.282996856777594
her husbands mr darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on	 2.5238508379364086
lord how unlucky there is not a bit of fish to be got today lydia	 4.310177664932793
doubt of my reception you shewed me how insufficient were all my	 3.5214059174913555
girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawingroom	 3.0104094011632747
young woman in the countrybut it was not till the evening of the	 3.7392093262700707
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement	 3.3794107594875853
number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham it had come	 3.235125835314715
considered it as the deathwarrant of all possibility of common sense	 3.342657057448073
what is mr darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him i am	 2.8179027684346805
idea of an accomplished woman	 3.4690467459819865
not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic	 2.3408038842399947
to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had	 2.4354431401121337
letter remained on her mind she was all surpriseall astonishment that	 2.582521943029888
and well laid out and to the cultivation of which he attended himself	 3.595082605887088
that mrs bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected	 2.776387645882521
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which	 2.5763093729374607
twicehow much i shall have to tell	 2.8454266199147917
condescended to ask i now give it to you if you are resolved on	 2.7212559336688553
irritable and completely under lydias guidance had been always	 3.088310147167513
of saying much her own thoughts were employing her she expected every	 2.5897466799370275
done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any	 2.449511347658951
waking mr hurst	 3.1457556331732954
of the silliest girls in the country i have suspected it some time but	 3.273463727227061
to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this	 2.926515179628395
deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the power of	 2.689889773809408
its contents as quickly complied with mrs bennet accompanied by her	 4.594758850949352
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i	 2.7750170335763937
and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her	 3.658078749058631
to yield readilyeasilyto the persuasion of a friend is no merit	 4.189561388687407
has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise	 2.823933920927148
the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour	 3.497081994494721
i can much more easily believe mr bingleys being imposed on than	 2.420383305513587
elizabeth was forced to go	 2.9953174306592834
of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself	 3.502588295694624
wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of	 2.921066850516415
did you go by the village of kympton	 3.080261578999029
daughters married its solace was visiting and news	 3.656632603334404
no more have i said mr bennet and i am glad to find that you do	 3.243003609088374
expeditiously married in london than in scotland	 2.4940792236663905
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised	 2.880188205955876
by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend	 3.339850684669194
for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect	 2.840215792496081
at night she opened her heart to jane though suspicion was very far	 2.64232357289792
at mr darcy there is a fine old saying which every body here is of	 2.4901948803448963
earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of	 2.729120122874935
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was	 3.643419505320331
reflection and she sat in misery till mr darcy appeared again when	 2.4106362047508654
elizabeth tried to join in her fathers pleasantry but could only force	 2.66412594431931
mrs collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often	 3.3457255450631123
acquainted with him and mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising	 3.6705775601492476
the scheme every part of it would have been perfect	 2.985746135185359
regard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and mr bennet	 2.702155830210404
habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five	 2.513189450226867
elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his	 3.5112957560271694
can scarcely conceive how they have tortured methough it was some	 3.559976766867875
receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that	 2.3500227422329045
her in every charm of air and address but she could remember no more	 2.7159182612311845
the church door and every body had as much to say or to hear on the	 2.477507040797684
absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that	 2.9314798052654543
if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your	 2.5648223161560493
they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in	 3.062378347894047
such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to	 2.1913781449509573
and i ought to feel it	 3.153354096622485
other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial	 2.400255865592693
your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has	 4.993766751092429
affection of a sister elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her	 3.2715160366563643
from epsom all that is known after this is that they were seen	 2.797018404665492
doubted not as the most generous of his sex but while he was mortal	 3.7807535436619726
would be prevailed on to go back with us change of scene might be of	 2.3507094071254007
joke	 1.9905095457977273
back again and summer finery and summer engagements arose mrs bennet	 2.75386881195492
it ought to be so it must be so while he retains the use of his	 3.091657183419083
my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncles	 2.401041263845116
mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal	 2.6388365018437008
saturday the pain of separation however might be alleviated on his	 3.327198876662453
brought back with great satisfaction a message from her ladyship	 2.995637642366387
this is not to be borne miss bennet i insist on being satisfied has	 3.148225404587139
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business	 3.318721647654832
i care about it though he is nothing to us you know and i am sure	 2.770824936187726
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained	 3.0732556121170074
was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation	 3.043266669537721
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory she was now	 3.719790892167573
the housekeeper came forward and told them it was the picture of a	 2.3816507223166195
to do something or other about it	 2.6695484905914078
it with delight as they passed into other rooms these objects were	 2.5637069995713953
only seen at church	 2.940301603602203
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always	 3.0566796924143578
what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the	 3.2779273426296944
in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your	 3.0115996858780023
patroness she is an arrogant conceited woman	 3.8988905045957574

but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my	 3.336773510241424
credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to	 3.9461145916062494

mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour	 4.653142345960585
yesterdayare you much acquainted with mr darcy	 2.658064772750461

elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr	 2.8037634601548764
with such forbearance and liberality towards him and there are other	 3.895760006974815
as i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who marries	 2.8562552637818177
should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an	 3.272469522462033
little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss	 2.618241317294312
tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any	 3.0796527228926025
though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his	 2.8510455234983603
curtseyed to him without saying a word	 3.0548585895147635
i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed cried	 2.3181867657643584
but the gloom of lydias prospect was shortly cleared away for she	 2.975543604399699
their affectionate mother shared all their grief she remembered what	 3.4291880925662874
at rosings a comparison that did not at first convey much	 2.6784657111283114
also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness	 2.8822065187940287
converse with them miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep	 2.678840760813659
hunsford and lady catherine de bourghit vexed her to see him	 4.112311347694769
arrival of her master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot	 2.460560961305938
this	 3.3515924979310876
his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have	 2.599328989862958
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some	 3.341058314545469
allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the	 2.9421047630196457
likely to make her more elegant elizabeth did all she could to shield	 2.693851027660875
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper but i am	 3.377449327510102
which they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the	 3.415130276490934
this she was perfectly unawareto her he was only the man who made	 2.90429582841416
reestablish a character we must not make him desperate	 2.924029906226389
was repeated to colonel f who instantly taking the alarm set off	 2.1890196902854995
interval of waiting appeared very long it was over at last however the	 2.380936460081468
out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me	 3.250217081734674
degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on	 2.857027957115811
with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected it was	 2.4048435381194104
generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to	 2.56276326646159
should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of	 4.149690438132233
most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it	 3.020018617584765
officers at once	 3.209291886543537
by any of us	 3.488492712928804
fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind	 2.7181505027349493
the present distance	 3.079310718382845
large party for the ball and a report soon followed that mr bingley	 2.569133127445851
to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke	 3.7415639450674667
reputation which her marriage had given her	 2.765368268573504
wishes to avoid seeing me he must go we are not on friendly terms	 2.442322802827247
my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express themby which	 3.442859317584519
each other the balm of sisterly consolation	 3.5331375699077157
any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of	 3.0991987047989142
to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce the marriage	 3.7535926202566476
in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that	 2.6822742262166135
my dearest love tell me what dish mr darcy is particularly fond of	 2.8180807993670434
observation whichever were the case though her opinion of him must be	 2.796512178156459
the door her husband looked impenetrably grave her daughters alarmed	 3.132703378414236
elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said	 3.0907591022071728
richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself but the	 3.2363219996349453
was not conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to	 2.9348356214301137
discourage him	 3.125219093982593
this could not have happened	 3.8536177850154933
force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of	 3.2086555224421547
but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this	 3.36566583567698
bourgh in this assemblyi am most thankful that the discovery is made	 3.437757123971907
stronglymarked features which might once have been handsome her air	 2.5837642224962587
first interview with its object and even before two words have been	 2.2372137266011953
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it	 3.2793198218014705
interest all her tender feelings and nothing therefore remained to be	 2.7480947927055617
retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected	 2.949135193901183
whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably	 2.480305319584178
and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge	 3.0458490095887165
and nothing at all to the others they were soon gone again rising from	 2.585105550586493
for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was	 2.9379000193151144
said elizabeth but without scheming to do wrong or to make others	 3.1034685069857524
will go when once they come to be entailed	 2.6840400867347594
indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored	 2.497581175636787
often does because there is an excuse for it one cannot wonder that so	 2.4044076054670978
good enough for him	 3.1595004943114584
it is from miss bingley said jane and then read it aloud	 2.5921774261273187
her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for	 3.334225211499831
forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she	 2.690645469869535
engaged	 3.795014021338373
intention but mr darcy chose to doubt itor to treat it as a merely	 3.4107779497658646
great pleasure in the power of choice i do not know any body who seems	 2.9419680966475616
her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bingley and the	 3.245976800404645
raised them in her opinion her affections had been continually	 3.3107840880442887
impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it mr bingley	 2.2930190167506295
when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her	 2.944474097470726
concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being	 3.783170677270977
delighted with him he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely	 2.5851888140749533
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without	 2.4448438230994434
simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant	 2.5729764337136434
1f3 limited right of replacement or refund if you discover a	 3.3520724165585882
elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said	 2.4754616655211894
would happen but who could have foreseen such an attention as this who	 2.871630027001629
reasonable her expressions more moderate it would have spared her from	 3.3610441276072143
which gave them meaning	 3.099279084818951
frailty would have mortified her so much not however from any fear of	 2.8473263880583706
long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion and	 2.873561738303534
of the officers wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing	 2.847953656435524
thursday with me she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady	 2.4663723756452853
brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious	 3.766853650365571
hunsford near westerham kent	 2.884186637786297
the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their	 2.811249381116274
between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those	 4.660236624442844
the hour we could not be married all day but luckily he came back	 2.6556489577971347
there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to	 4.5746491442207615
two young men one has got all the goodness and the other all the	 3.1906089603347407
you have always so much	 2.845451578931344
importance	 3.782011194633111
jane in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness	 3.480332760400015
comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday she was	 3.093352075962396
mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her	 2.4531981707290615
very oddyet it did and even a third it seemed like wilful	 2.7297230991096453
good luck they must all go to brighton that is the place to get	 2.5312604891917503
pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted	 2.444697940832527
or why did he thus come a day before he was expected had they been	 2.372270113678967
yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise	 3.1338382168352608
elizabeth answered only by a slight bow her thoughts were instantly	 2.7815247321195034
years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be	 3.0658792653757163
and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to	 3.067994588885887
sphere he is a gentleman i am a gentlemans daughter so far we are	 2.7027485105699087
the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined	 2.2246209648473316
the effect was immediate a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his	 3.779042256646962
i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my	 2.2483366428554623
mr collinss return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of	 2.698733565047967
very welland this offer of marriage you have refused	 3.0302081593787693
house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally	 5.358838414981493
connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy	 2.410635049758804
consideration nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving	 2.579419610606384
disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a	 3.814320045544727
while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to mr	 2.2092298310345284
party	 3.8286909807303386
directly	 3.4592690653095635
together and fourthly that the match might be broken off two	 3.319008207554442
come darcy said he i must have you dance i hate to see you	 3.09975383063667
this file should be named 426718txt or 426718zip	 4.138661471860225
to be mistress of pemberley might be something	 3.31505380869166
darcys in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and	 2.9602356903724933
our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to	 3.1392496459365997
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness	 2.9781709421958147
elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from	 2.2813591948061855
security for her husbands not being killed in a duel	 3.1365444891281493
marry earlythe last born has as good a right to the pleasures of	 2.950945531331675
i must ask whether you were surprised said elizabeth	 2.3618157683756675
than felt herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment	 2.902312480660137
person of ranksuch affability and condescension as he had himself	 4.5674991268462595
have as little trouble in the business as possible when the first	 2.6302907695309066
mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him charlotte had seen	 2.475087137581869
is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year	 2.5183582033482237
mr and mrs gardiner smiled elizabeth could not help saying it is	 2.8477995812871892
never was i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr collinss	 2.2183458749656633
married you know at st clements because wickhams lodgings were in	 3.0764121962029005
interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer	 2.569656604950676
me but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well	 3.0358763593998126
said mr bennet as he folded up the letter he seems to be a most	 3.430292962426127
oh cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted but it is so	 3.1628579697571646
brother is the cause of it i need not explain myself farther and	 2.721794068831162
sister or that i rejoice in my success towards him i have been	 3.3399268981628794
trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so well	 3.141093296230164
concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a	 2.8222654419761657
jane and till the morrow their going was deferred miss bingley was	 2.863391504560672
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your	 3.4112077619862444
elizabeth said no morebut her mind could not acquiesce the	 3.1607673023381397
are two things that i want very much to knowone is how much money	 2.575991282212232
neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model there is not a	 3.1048984347970237
arranges the business just as he pleases	 2.919755521594306
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves they repulsed	 3.418045283315457
into silence and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the	 3.5099323206981206
world i love and he is an angel i should never be happy without	 3.156220907442285
conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from	 2.70263838273688
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingleys dislike of her had	 2.400287508666121
quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight then returned	 2.8618275249243728
child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my	 3.918257616155323
1f5 some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied	 2.3468241563204018
nor i i am sure said miss bingley	 3.198472916597755
these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth but the wife of mr	 3.2141121920519535
meryton and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that	 2.6461877546743735
their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance	 2.9101836068996882
mr bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided	 2.420947211352834
fitzwilliams occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was	 3.8424703223054615
daughters as janes marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of	 2.4712768559963223
in this room they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there	 2.345257721546356
charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty	 2.452764756366685
there	 3.3786540658580217
minute description which wickham could give and in bestowing her	 2.8035519816553385
superior to his sister as well by nature as education the netherfield	 2.70277674622078
may i ask but checking himself he added in a gayer tone is it in	 2.7377292929131607
frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty	 2.5121795672272405
the colour now rushed into elizabeths cheeks in the instantaneous	 2.7194461146103266
forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some	 2.3767261346227713
off together	 3.421778932316026
this we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the	 2.767644220943086
disagreeable man all to yourself but i hope you will not mind it it is	 2.6906251148579465
suddenly addressed her with	 2.9914720307391334
curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty	 3.112455994731458
returns royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and	 3.164704208272361
before he complimented mrs bennet on having so fine a family of	 2.6773189272656723
seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into	 2.536052589876789
feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them my temper	 3.230597473585308
moments of such painful confusion	 2.7599328762323956
vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is	 3.2385949982614344
his manners are very different from his cousins	 2.7656561869627367
so much the better i hope they will not meet at all but does not jane	 2.391207704444687
mrs jenkinsons room she would be in nobodys way you know in that	 2.7599083833914686
hour her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was	 3.08396929524851
we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire	 2.5830336785627934
admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust	 2.4083514644669144
if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as	 2.757859182974492
elizabeth it must be something particular to take him there at this	 2.4761317375755842
his love for you and there will be an end of the matter	 2.8958853589087488
most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me	 2.596751834045339
feared w was not a man to be trusted my poor mother is really ill	 3.3723312162353327
her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of	 3.6593645543400166
first to listen and to pity the first to be admired and in his manner	 4.081107485914315
deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that	 2.703065906595025
the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just	 2.2796094868807053
known i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain	 3.919725839562266
presumption to aspire can never take place no never mr darcy is	 2.5952812174477824
comers indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us to visit	 2.8598692705228883
goodnatured wishes for her welldoing which had proceeded before from	 3.209511845091878
to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of	 2.3909325559685533
returned within the stated time seriously however she felt tolerably	 2.464609518642451
companions all the way to longbourn elizabeth listened as little as she	 2.8628422899102706
thankful that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness	 2.7032421879836592
in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to mrs	 4.0836428517634875
him	 3.2810320072689203
can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it	 2.4573540332760464
read it aloud said their father for i hardly know myself what it is	 2.3399631298436394
his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the	 3.1430238241900454
good or evil must be done by him every idea that had been brought	 2.632150877670002
i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william	 2.2999570075873477
they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to	 2.8447566215930853
night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she	 2.454082486072452
entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh	 2.680988940657483
one should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brotherinlaw and	 5.2186484474130195
and immediately said	 3.0299729398658304
particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our	 3.3158450487272733
revived	 1.9905095457977273
shut i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness	 3.1160398167060817
day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he had brought	 2.936097334963738
pride of one who had ten thousand ayear	 2.5079424398763703
his father was an excellent man said mrs gardiner	 2.4509970818521
still something more to ask of the former my father is going to	 2.5175879175491143
themselveswe have tried two or three subjects already without	 2.610960286492535
lady catherine seemed resigned	 2.918326826110609
paragraph 1c below there are a lot of things you can do with project	 3.3265542826866734
does not care about you	 2.954316670228691

at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually	 2.8177991028517204
mr bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the	 3.0078285709312165

an easy distance do you call it it is nearly fifty miles	 3.100988168236815
house but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the	 2.6635893238182935
house where they were to remain a few days	 4.244673997011058
circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to	 3.252562410674391
had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have	 2.642354132637137
however little mr darcy might have liked such an address he contented	 2.423646457614782
elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded	 2.6840002802670684
saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother	 2.879939007990323
must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have	 2.7990422114788585

i certainly shall not you know how i detest it unless i am	 2.60098690856864
she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the	 3.6412653672700968
she was reading a sermon however i did not hear above one word in ten	 2.397677284213512
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts she was not sorry however to	 4.354408017243595
so many months so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all	 2.94215413192399
their two selves only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion	 2.726780221331938
well when she came into the room this morning her dirty petticoat	 2.7767282868082988
readily obeyed mrs gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing	 2.9771480696268307
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him but i	 3.628713585980988
at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such	 2.908556438981188

i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a	 2.7477188048048826
of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of	 3.2846108929399596
with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers it was	 4.227680272938706
lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievablethat one false	 3.8127347208969455
conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with	 2.459332781235136
money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there then shewing	 2.6396046727032028

at all like your going such a way off must it be so	 2.428586968681981
useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small	 2.3764999208047946
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by	 2.9104873218197884

care of himyes i really believe darcy does take care of him in	 2.8689495727397
youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of	 3.451471971304999
of an hours têteàtête with mrs bennet before breakfast a	 2.5551821941289177
elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by	 2.8057428119167724
she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to	 2.5964260477098686
elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how	 3.3634382221146124
relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore	 3.4414495619280867
events mr wickham wrote to inform me that having finally	 3.0595955962888106
amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you	 4.021923095971774
no it would have been strange if they had but i make no doubt they	 2.985057820185469
enforced them earnestlybut however this remonstrance might have	 2.7165283692655064
feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his	 3.213183544595127
heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day and tell my dear	 2.2682705282278404
receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself instead of a	 2.451224805578849
she herself had been barbarously used by them all and on these two	 2.9340927291206107

imputed to my getting wet through yesterday my kind friends will	 3.182075479777264
the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper	 3.2818831991474138
yesbut as it happens they are all of them very clever	 3.5103644519956294
her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the	 2.5611133094477947
fashion	 1.9905095457977273
on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at	 2.615476014936146

editions all of which are confirmed as public domain in the us	 2.940188857550102
my motive for cautioning you is as follows we have reason to imagine	 2.9456465136958436

i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you	 3.306809074884352
mr bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued	 2.470820315162396
mr darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling	 2.8013663549114263
he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth	 4.1762372808815575

and do you really know all this cried mrs gardiner whose curiosity	 2.349268757814902

originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome	 3.4014944826498414

improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham and nothing less than	 3.147769469757725
mother talked on of her dislike of mr darcy and her resolution to be	 2.768846508645026
opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song	 3.4738538087561657
i beg your pardon i will try again at present i am not in love with	 2.7071597717707556

let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way	 2.697367706745345

why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley i am	 2.6058071869718993
to come to the point at last what made you so shy of me when you first	 2.8552346560430024
of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the	 4.55690382973519
propriety and delicacy have you not heard me say that from his	 2.500629418698491
were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball	 2.638688845555599
newlyborn notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of	 4.4643039189292155
he must be an oddity i think said she i cannot make him	 3.467647217725452
dilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion	 2.8546122340352755
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which	 3.7183233039957644
afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew mr darcy though i	 2.291994910896056
their plan and would not give his real opinion about it he did not	 2.793375268861404
objection all loveliness and goodness as she is her understanding	 3.891644814896473
possible she was more alive to the disgrace which the want of new	 4.2498060184719755
the case	 3.3456277636657905
it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr bennet and	 2.890781986068643
that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the	 2.5190319919418562
occasion for entailing estates from the female lineit was not thought	 4.991135362252322
mrs bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married and she	 2.600169602233805
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and	 4.017038574060493
at pemberley	 3.420532663625119
ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human	 2.835235709558616
and her husband at longbourn as soon as they were married that he was	 2.7981428148070577
something for fortune and figure	 2.927900200949154
often applied to feelings which arise from an halfhours acquaintance	 2.525524231402556
to counterbalance these advantages mr darcy had considerable patronage	 3.438778582458208
bennet	 3.4124301928485274
though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for	 2.493089285319697
will not leave london before he has found them who is to fight wickham	 2.45274671140085

dear to have given him one of your set downs i quite detest the man	 2.766057236427056

you take an eager interest in that gentlemans concerns said darcy in	 3.165573524096886

will be answered	 3.0648827985676785
eveningelizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment	 2.7202372422314878
in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire	 2.420333355236195
her curtsey and address to his friend	 3.1734102662949724
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to	 2.542725881723152
moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her during your	 2.8412114870225227
possibility as that she could encourage him herself and her	 3.536697705441185

think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements	 2.7925772373956597
to escape she added lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing	 3.347221241719926
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole	 3.4113398753291952
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to	 3.273958912277509
till its success could be known likewise for though feeling almost	 2.1973434073170206
good gracious mr darcyand so it does i vow well any friend of	 2.5990590683732506
did not know him in the least lord how i laughed and so did mrs	 3.3991199952972595
and as they drew near the appointed inn where mr bennets carriage was	 3.1209609656791524
natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging there is	 5.093090699676579
went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town but	 2.624646319962994
case	 3.8390878186763477
before you came back jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare	 2.4073891067219892
i wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is	 2.3780153608886554
of a good fortune must be in want of a wife	 2.586971185275277
probably more than she felt for herself the carriage was sent to meet	 2.6280257230305444

imprudent as a marriage between mr wickham and our poor lydia	 2.696480679216697
outthere is something very pompous in his styleand what can he	 3.118641154432217
and may i ask said elizabeth but the terms i suppose must be	 2.6931960204900642
elizabeth coloured and saida little	 3.906048101978843
indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancingi entreat you	 3.8970332186051193
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister and	 2.7650444664037774
it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a	 3.008350928051327
placed within and it was pronounced to be ready after an affectionate	 3.4475562588358306
invariably silly	 3.3434628168775475
may stay a little longer mrs collins will be very glad of your	 2.5964055423708876
seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she i am	 3.078899473886786
her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met	 3.0348049391044016
expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present	 3.3803764655130553
not pronounce she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his	 2.9456794044712837
women in the room and which he thought the prettiest and his	 3.9927713129591536
you to stay two months i told mrs collins so before you came there	 2.2212657107302194
delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of	 2.3594111679510705
enough to leave her room elizabeth was glad to be taken to her	 2.806131410566804
inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such	 2.7804936836126686
present occasion and secondly of my room i shall be glad to have the	 3.561888007308573
situation he could conjecture very little about it he must go	 2.993782409793992
remainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation to	 2.635758507359551
london	 3.2430679028547256

glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage	 2.729637319831871
business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to	 2.9323265919883266
yes she did	 3.107707490582338
to say no other apology to offer if i have wounded your sisters	 3.321071975654792
she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out she	 2.9967315372778085
towards mr collins by janes introduction of him she received him with	 2.348269473653147
true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room well colonel	 3.018996357940567
separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their	 3.0759104778674287
connected with the letter he held it suddenly struck her that it might	 2.833023015743612
you must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth	 2.8215302847921153
soon as he comes	 3.4111564677797186
character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had	 2.4259056613087475
good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of	 4.672647899902283
i must not decide on my own performance	 3.718592729418417
in company with either of them their society can afford no pleasure	 2.52582615935549
wanted she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery	 3.0670815328007817
mr darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching	 2.66184300213892
books	 1.9905095457977273
images of the original pages are available through	 3.7615250802523486
mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay	 2.755146178480384
herself when her father continued	 2.8381360379206235
forwarder than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour ago	 2.4877427583370695
and lydia but while they were supported by their mothers indulgence	 3.050042063807855
when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley were	 2.966829264278535
longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved	 3.264790064399012
an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after	 2.772346122295061
not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your	 3.1424378635219803
way his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her	 3.3815771773946888
his affection might be reanimated and the influence of his friends	 3.9721230224947983
you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first	 2.248164369191185
to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false	 3.610840866961093
concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that	 3.4118673306515066
her you have a sweet room here mr bingley and a charming prospect	 2.8887310087962463
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady	 2.431919425371079
you look conscious young ladies have great penetration in such matters	 3.1035926584801095
ohyou mean jane i supposebecause he danced with her twice to be	 2.5218741478479463
much entailed as ever the lucases are very artful people indeed	 2.939593543884344
where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherines curiosity	 3.3898613206218604
miss bingley i think i have heard you say that you know them	 2.780786035566462
mrs annesley is with her the others have been gone on to scarborough	 2.4099090476234304
and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty	 2.8916344171073662
was all pride and insolence	 2.9716570379225313
ever since he was four years old	 2.6151904438502274
on the subject	 3.53830820267177
himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain	 2.6011730892105627
business in london	 3.1446978498544764
a hope of wickhams meaning to marry her no one but jane she thought	 2.4872127987276342
sight	 3.857856655895136
enough happened in the time good gracious when i went away i am sure	 2.745646261186755

sake of what had been rather than what was charlottes first letters	 2.636470130375112
could not approve him nor could she for a moment repent her refusal or	 3.399262123808841
after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a	 4.208205281617179
till next week you would probably do it you would probably not	 2.4235657389398706
attention the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire lest she	 3.2596016424812766
match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too	 5.401520084082941
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock	 2.6390196661705545
intended	 3.866932795656244
society she was of course carefully kept and though mrs wickham	 2.814872866966924
render mr darcys conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a	 2.4068733405553493
coming here i had no notion but he would go a shooting or something or	 2.866182389861393
exceedingly as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its	 2.9976047091325
wellinformed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was	 2.8063478863526954
was surprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme	 2.6011483009330583
in darcys breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her	 2.7642322137385915
his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his	 2.5013127780770463
springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the	 2.990537496088965

my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly	 2.207776342722824
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty but if	 3.270924026525026
even wish for any renewal of his attentions his character sunk on every	 3.1487169304320886

soon as she possibly could she was no sooner in possession of it than	 3.887658015418331
once from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day	 2.7987043839196186
her stay as they had been at first the very last evening was spent	 2.9517367090288955
his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride	 3.1250261463303395
the marriage of her sisters he bore with philosophy the conviction that	 3.506235660999346
was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she	 3.7335220968989824
will be satisfied with what i have done i am not romantic you know i	 3.4136268463047537
are they indeed cried elizabeth with the greatest satisfaction	 2.8193583835633382
he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a	 3.254410653084888
something very much to the purpose of course he begins with	 3.112373599657804
liability to you for damages costs and expenses including legal	 3.6654713159510193
information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting	 2.418265565911465
gloomy elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it her power	 2.2996944117273195
you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and	 2.1736045095453886
inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man	 2.908650036553952
certainly did not hate him no hatred had vanished long ago and she	 3.329872411470286

discredit and misery my child let me not have the grief of seeing	 3.028268331435175
domestic happiness were overthrown but mr bennet was not of a	 3.1976017274923265

i must find mr gardiner this moment on business that cannot be	 2.2061244474896156
things said than i am going to say but he is an ugly fellow i am glad	 3.646975773502005
each to be dwelt on farther	 4.096129027239976
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family mrs	 3.3033937870808145

the use of project gutenbergtm works calculated using the method	 3.35590461739023
when at length they arose to take leave mrs bennet was most pressingly	 3.135246492576929
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad	 3.582841357175418
which she could not praise the house furniture neighbourhood and	 2.674229322501581
to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there	 3.414496717777249
kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove no	 2.5593186001654447

to him with a most sincere regard and she parted from him convinced	 2.724066479509609
you may well warn me against such an evil human nature is so prone to	 2.499279745027436
imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other	 3.593097487066455
wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with	 2.7422686541617454
with the housekeepers room	 3.8462491695538046
appeared dissatisfied on the strength of darcys regard bingley had the	 3.4558130592305507
countenance expressed real security such a circumstance could only	 2.7464737221275057
varied however her determination never did	 2.774623188213666
it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your	 2.8482851865466037
casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr darcy	 2.8668891912730676
door jane was at a drawingroom window watching their arrival when	 2.4481215364729803
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed	 2.3069961818908253
you are mistaken i write rather slowly	 2.5338955518556094
mrs collins well	 3.065217770886278
i am dear sir c c	 2.5158825002894147
uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off by	 3.362289952678413
give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other	 3.5877293616886616
the evening because you are in each others confidence and have secret	 2.5567978020015976
not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their	 3.3241577992141336

the diningparlour she then joined them soon enough to see lydia with	 2.6844970445973693
greatest share the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had	 4.284591851792143
from any return of mr collinss addresses by engaging them towards	 3.261011768476396
of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children	 3.4542993608547556
would judge differently in the affair	 3.74466831645316
together but enough of this you alluded to something else you	 2.5271019338573875
there is such a sight to be seen i will not tell you what it is make	 2.903671056537476
she urged jane to borrow mr bingleys carriage immediately and at	 2.9385558294446055
there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those	 3.473115028257968
delighted the rain continued the whole evening without intermission	 2.4949073573975484
if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it	 2.432879459306257
disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to	 3.3894263210689974
they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i	 4.203136479622942
elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and	 3.3274513630154954
altered a creature that when she went away i was perfectly	 2.5453239583798117
society i own is necessary to me i have been a disappointed man and	 2.700946798065295

in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to	 3.859611393720795
bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and	 2.3964911899089767

mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise	 2.4760213275641862
disconcerted she could not imagine what business he could have in town	 2.790062225337179
connections and pride	 3.160571357659202
as she allowed him to speak you either chuse this method of passing	 2.5577366152881376

of whom does jane ever think ill and who is there whatever might be	 2.2089643213505195
up to him as a superior your lively talents would place you in the	 2.4024450311470993
find it not equal to lydias for him she had scarcely needed her	 2.6764174145958286
and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of	 2.4776067509151805
london georgianas reception of them was very civil but attended with	 3.239546480844185
oh my dear brother replied mrs bennet that is exactly what i	 2.48690310866273
will probably be of some duration	 3.0729350143387335
the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding	 3.2736189656978434
did not expect such a compliment	 2.9107636160780337
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday senight	 2.7416853658794276
he shook his headi wish i could call her amiable it gives me pain	 2.5914105816837316

there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if	 3.5431604778671697

jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern she knew but little	 2.2300624979138566
felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as	 2.9332123183784393

oh said lydia stoutly i am not afraid for though i am the	 3.264770662943247

compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing	 2.6646601078540484
oh noit is not for me to be driven away by mr darcy if he	 3.5960663854287844

of shame that she could hardly keep her seat it drew from her	 3.070510812135527
frequent discussion between her parents elizabeth saw directly that her	 2.621969517261406
i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for	 2.101007715024066
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give	 3.2230379785388648
manner	 3.43816644029785
she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her putting	 2.276906434872416

freely i can recal nothing worse but the fact is that we are very	 2.7123933453599665

with his friend	 3.038339845894747
my dear mr bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome you	 2.6956099239705313

this half hour and master has had a letter	 2.467586044104065
you shall hear thenbut prepare yourself for something very dreadful	 2.3794007929942347
civilities bingley was the principal spokesman and miss bennet the	 3.1661526039044157
grounds are delightful they have some of the finest woods in the	 3.3663377989263035
occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man	 3.8154595963141085

that	 3.307735562222932
design nonsense how can you talk so but it is very likely that he	 2.915174635416745
her husband might then have rested in its proper place	 2.5626289337906165
who do not cherish a feeling of selfcomplacency on the score of some	 3.9457531257273084
did as the day of his arrival drew near	 2.6635129416851524
ever to pay him	 2.987589850063478
manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it	 4.588952342534359
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had	 3.5886187802655023
hurst had a house the next was in these words i do not pretend to	 2.872315287726552
suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his	 2.4836205897655894
there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliams manners	 3.343782738764799
he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when	 2.5558138014668863
gone my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have	 2.958495548612292
scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under	 3.380139271387327
he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of	 2.6948884673579134
happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant farm	 3.6206179927700757
likewise turned towards mr darcy with an expression of halflaughing	 2.9921122302281162
and now we are better	 2.9529434866177966
campand from her correspondence with her sister there was still less	 3.337902162875328
license terms from this work or any files containing a part of this	 3.43103326257278
that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive	 2.535537913447114
and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved	 3.4691852956171996
she was at least free from the offence of mr darcys farther notice	 3.6351384339693684
colour and shape and the eyelashes so remarkably fine might be	 3.8867605146609048
both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great	 3.050178709305246

behind you and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the	 2.6571130240301235
no lizzy that is what i do not choose i should be sorry you know	 3.5494329257764385
that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed	 3.1314737924435923
splendor and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings	 3.4219983186489986
the want of importance in his friends connections than from their want	 2.3750466121364817
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a	 2.8040234197688094
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value	 2.3583829585601377
i have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him	 2.9554968189375592
elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for	 2.7126669565971304
on her she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of	 2.777849425854289
observed in them for ever	 2.792985047197143
go the next day for a short time	 2.989144247786735

for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure	 2.487333586442613
animated mrs collins knew not what to make of him colonel	 2.4748724021517194
of happiness but it was not to be did you ever hear darcy mention the	 2.695924348684995
not all that mrs bennet however with the assistance of her five	 2.464265089446642
his easy temper or her affectionate heart the darling wish of his	 2.2463497517038338

he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their	 2.6773377253528143
ached acutely elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were	 3.44895929197182
for an answer mrs bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was	 2.689688068512198
that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his	 3.7783861312413163
to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her	 3.0208492628167174
and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given	 3.1857624437307015
bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to	 2.7314671428522463
mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a	 3.311146866873681
entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was	 3.512334149929083
and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments very	 3.980939769642776
me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it my	 4.230182552319033
completely in your wayand if the second i can admire you much better	 2.5769351231719835
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning and mr collins having	 2.910494538117891
kitty who took all these threats in a serious light began to cry	 2.9190619882260487
blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that	 2.482408114902714
must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music	 2.528007973459789
gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyships carriage was	 3.16945359268482
she can have her own waybut i tell you what miss lizzy if you take	 2.762206998150049
in what an amiable light does this place him thought elizabeth	 2.301039145217222
she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on	 3.391739121329903
there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel	 2.1761403653697746
i did not think you wouldand that being the case i cannot consider	 2.579839133532283
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most	 4.092681894208924
take care lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointment	 3.1101441262134117
along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton	 2.5832101336002933
she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslin and	 4.035805760943702
as these but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the	 3.0994761646556364
in civility	 3.3079158494118723
were properly overjoyed on the occasion the younger girls formed hopes	 3.4378037422875543
my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i	 2.466158644207398
brought up by him at his own expencehe is now gone into the army	 2.7657625299324837
with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many	 2.297219812907623
near so much like a ball	 2.7261395776108954
for the night and mrs bennet with great politeness and cordiality said	 2.735035620681034
of mr collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london	 3.053759145722259
boast and so fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to	 4.346990813308911
the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her	 3.0202719712382735
with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike	 2.6990333032353275
intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every	 2.8852881406030777
she supposed if he meant any thing he must mean an allusion to what	 2.5408941107709366
and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very	 3.3724153496287568
trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the	 4.5808741434001305
particular allowing for the common demands of the game mr wickham was	 4.599656587981369
though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much	 3.7943289489818106
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care	 4.7384547151586816
wonder at her being where she was	 3.0260796409502215
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth	 2.897880306960031
father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these	 2.280624074414501
imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love	 2.8885114160822845
at length the parsonage was discernible the garden sloping to the road	 2.9022544147247404
lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or	 2.8078077642442287
beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much	 3.627219316520876
constitution which has prevented her making that progress in many	 2.469831454940855

bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in	 2.9025684095725435
warn me off his grounds	 2.7648691940644916
him it is because he will not give himself the trouble	 2.4467017066051024
advantage for having a couple ofor i may say three very silly	 3.5338776725916694
here when you sent for uswas it so	 2.681381042378551
himself was no very difficult point to persuade him against	 2.351702446319291
regret that he came	 2.978528372779459
cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you	 2.7127999893885018
yes my youngest is not sixteen perhaps she is full young to be much	 2.4245739132661135
and warmth remained for bingleys salutation he was full of joy and	 2.4852475268161665
done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and	 2.8550959564431926
for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth	 3.787956913446455
did not you think mr darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well	 2.7691245231642836
but i was embarrassed	 3.6303774325553175
effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications as i must	 3.76943396951419
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she	 2.4433413571521974
appear to the greatest advantage in walkingif the first i should be	 3.175572640254616
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room she wished she	 2.6118532127044105
avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce he had	 3.7540149627483563
greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were	 3.362735599454296
yoursdo you draw	 3.196113875420821
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him in	 4.0288339949895455
thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate she put down the	 2.6355240241641607
mrs philipss supper party but his manners recommended him to every	 3.1488318986693686
she looked and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with	 2.361012554239299
to others as in his reproaches to myself after this period every	 3.170619392691899
full of both i know you will do him such ample justice that i am	 2.5552320718123807
with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her	 4.50707615318231
affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into	 3.3136477719087023
next day you will give your motherinlaw a few hints when this	 3.1731036830069668
i shall be very fit to see janewhich is all i want	 3.732047349839413
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for	 3.7521424098574245
let me call your maid is there nothing you could take to give you	 2.439013477079433
as she pronounced these words mr darcy changed colour but the emotion	 3.138532712231109
to her mother and kitty but her letters were always long expected and	 2.6001474381058176
abovementioned and while mr darcy was attending them to their	 3.2262277443306484
had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her	 2.693912564164533
to him oh how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation	 2.912681931198078
compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings	 3.1450462938429102
our dear bingley what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always	 2.8271675303300126
delayed a little longer and mr collinss proposal accepted with as	 2.8040865805618007
jane was so admired nothing could be like it every body said how well	 2.579835578548192
their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing	 2.88538294056449
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the	 4.420750470476585
him better when they met in kent than before and that she had never	 2.8871146693689465
assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth	 4.133688167615227
with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel	 3.9308937404698465
a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant	 2.3555977722134105
mr bingley was good looking and gentlemanlike he had a pleasant	 3.3090358581941706
yes sir but i do not know when that will be i do not know who is	 2.857785280889295
each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so	 2.7338300634524937
been but little assisted by education or society the greatest part of	 3.0991535547752656
while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different	 3.0454441401077066
pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs	 3.5555035319243458
and distributed to anyone in the united states without paying any fees	 4.132965801797097
hopes of mr bingleys heart were entertained	 2.8811457517429706
nothing and i will not be sent on a fools errand again	 3.7345951697659783
hearing the very best performers on miss lucass persevering however	 2.6030895695810616
you provide in accordance with paragraph 1f3 a full refund of any	 3.825416714688015
known sir williams too long he could tell her nothing new of the	 2.242499258568192
but did not live to do itmr bingley intended it likewise and	 2.294230434567601
have somebody who thinks of those things where shall you change	 2.6865316008909375
aye no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had	 3.2581654998520304
with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms darcy	 2.4060144969367556
edged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being mr	 3.8721076736054667
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery	 3.20811951335098
and she rose as she spoke lady catherine rose also and they turned	 2.9694674869634268
his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as	 2.463264688695877
your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned	 2.9229568345266346
pressing entreaties that they would come in and even in spite of mrs	 3.121510790858669
above her ancles in dirt and alone quite alone what could she mean by	 2.8115281505260517
posted on the official project gutenbergtm web site <URL>	 3.683715440310967
and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as	 2.2146584619211933
complaisancebut in vain mary would not understand them such an	 2.2592815034654303
the children but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the	 3.1741351963439066
it will be her turn soon to be teazed said miss lucas i am going	 3.4594207505770753
miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to	 2.707476198135966
chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of	 2.331568731704309
when her mother went up to her dressingroom at night she followed her	 3.093210310533076
for she loves to be of use but tell me what did you come down to	 3.2438776652092898
requited their taking her home and affording her their personal	 2.894516764536092
thereupon but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend	 3.2430782108751255
for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as	 3.538297374967244
catherines unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of	 3.9226432138776626
miss elizabeth bennet	 3.2388973651495654
all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs	 2.4694967943629993
when the teathings were removed and the card tables placed the ladies	 4.7094325938707176
would come in time	 2.9168079552310067
the servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathless an	 2.9694164064528143
partiality when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my	 3.211814897031087
united volubility in lydias imagination a visit to brighton comprised	 2.524090917514388
your engagement	 3.351115171287169
saying	 3.8286595844878644
her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than	 3.3791235047779193
an ensign	 3.04644583409114
very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds	 2.870262195716937
well my dear said mr bennet when elizabeth had read the note	 2.513177614060301
i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be	 2.461313351676254
good heaven can it be really so yet now i must believe you cried	 2.2642283046521023
mr darcy took her advice and did finish his letter	 2.4830862844151214
that he crouded his cousins had more to say than he could well manage	 2.6820441276325635
london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the	 2.189625162109319
introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in	 2.910592943867989
upon without some help any place would do of about three or four	 2.151839519861906
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would	 2.7638568105426216
rather offended and therefore checked her laugh miss bingley warmly	 2.72523343740549
perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any	 2.440323585894188
this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree i	 2.8091168453134228
because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement	 2.844344233564977
affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive	 2.759848140426598
but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had	 2.9396960913218133
after this day jane said no more of her indifference not a word passed	 2.728448563506874
slowly towards the house	 2.919417775322279
had allowed her to apply i am confident that she would have performed	 4.310982292801476
and what did she say	 2.769341354250769
mr darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was	 3.126254912928822
things you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us we	 2.8968668993321605
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round	 3.4300382226031805
tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and	 4.030249780624522
bingleys large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their	 2.580201066721128
assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amendsbut	 3.6097193074879277
along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was	 2.8077566380741277
and when immediately before my fathers death mr darcy gave him a	 2.739774335965623
there had appeared very insufficient and she read it again widely	 3.271138514251247
believed it possible	 3.1767688008797346
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune	 2.369374599368133
bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to	 3.0259552191763808
as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she	 2.8095745910533263
help reverting once more to the first and saying	 2.839901935314365
just done to give pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a liking to the	 2.97428010526241
very amiable but charlottes kindness extended farther than elizabeth	 2.232349910369399
ah sir i do indeed it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you	 2.715043831798184
two daughters married and the man whom she could not bear to speak of	 2.995231702170214
would perhaps be called resentfulmy good opinion once lost is lost	 2.359371388469091
and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he	 2.3378588299111724
moment or are the result of previous study	 3.3280130192370154
were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with	 2.671206599771453
doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady	 3.020814074998874
miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cards she is a great	 3.8072272409360917
report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to	 2.470429915109807
coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again	 3.8178804803581823
success she expected he was resolutely silent however and from a	 2.788546712671961
tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she	 2.634471058236977
minutes my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in	 2.2990648291092337

sisterinlaw was sure he would make her an offer before we came away	 2.434675365527635
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions	 3.99625513655892
far as i thought myself privileged for you i shall send this by	 2.632540976675613
elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the	 3.291112807257998
however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor	 3.044395744567458
janes delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to	 2.702114071827216
with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to	 2.502895235066762
he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle	 4.204138071791545

encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered	 3.43843003097895
soon afterwards ordered her carriage upon this signal the youngest of	 2.5152961439549966
allowances and urged the possibility of mistakesbut by everybody else	 3.7517592539100617

that there was much affection in the case	 3.0040888501749854

in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of	 2.750818273128893
unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her	 2.840525723092653
him i had not thought so very ill of himi had supposed him to be	 2.908923125208741
thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think	 4.411013368899682

i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect he owns it	 3.4540688897264147
i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left	 2.5321077862306067

from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which	 2.2993639053208335
my love should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so	 2.6590722569729897

had received his commission before he left london and he was to join	 3.0955334704604787
are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you	 2.644509343513114
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to	 3.3134292223383723

wickham is not so undeserving then as we have thought him said her	 2.748720338425286
elizabeth was now to see mr wickham for the last time having been	 2.6840314222648183
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and	 2.621469279400523
in paragraph 1f3 this work is provided to you asis with no other	 4.3050422068482215
sir william did not say much he was storing his memory with anecdotes	 3.7078306980701625
one and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived	 2.658016697577398
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner you had much better	 2.5810725481082546
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of	 2.7335888925246548
them	 3.0861605593407195
mr collins on his return highly gratified mrs bennet by admiring mrs	 2.3443997762069957
consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to	 3.0857494217126025

transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming	 3.0292332536429183
sister at once though mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich	 3.6430144270214226
oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her	 3.5429127877398905
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down	 2.1975450607933213
it after this explanation	 2.9181061302362714
was exactly what darcy had hoped to see they were able to love each	 2.317900223350705
thought of him and mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by	 3.3960757179828445
temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes it	 2.5912027168306695
and make him marry her if he comes away	 2.564398455330213
insupportable than those of the generality of travellers	 3.517036750865454

probability of a rainy season made her feel that the commonest	 3.407724195214822
that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four	 3.0189590371112813
as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner	 3.54513835958264
entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some	 3.3569879757697665
shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane his	 3.2908235103693264
to be in a hurry i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first	 3.1567908049323057
not perhaps of neglecting his own interest but of every other neglect	 2.8824137179015725
the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a	 3.7767098214158015
one morning about a week after bingleys engagement with jane had been	 2.465027456513251
dreadful at length in a voice of forced calmness he said	 2.5380696856557505
herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to	 4.264870845558572
every body hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them	 2.690859460099174
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she	 2.653070214471782

mrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no	 2.792154466405495
open and their visitor entered it was lady catherine de bourgh	 2.818326958835248
then it is as i always hoped cried jane they are married	 2.4084749257377775

building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of high	 4.438594519445259
my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to was a question	 2.5346765428145686
i had much rather go in the coach	 2.752456557880696
we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that	 3.1188015548908865
she spoke an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened	 3.8724786714145583
another month complete it will be in my power to take one of you as	 3.4297849457944753

confirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of what	 4.040290245067078
the whole party jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and	 2.9549663915878503
at all	 3.3229897590491246

elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help	 4.079405411614296
when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a	 4.225786203887309
mr and mrs gardiners coming up they were all pressed to go into the	 3.0682611617358257
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his	 3.121004848990464
astonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of mrs	 2.765048912962837

mr wickhams attention was caught and after observing mr collins for	 3.4299635714418595
shortly checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her	 3.0187798080795654

her all imaginable happiness	 3.0564920164718083
her minute enquiries that though jane always struggled to support her	 3.011971644211669
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly	 2.6382936953148
indeed i could not i was uncomfortable enough i was very	 3.5954601908598587

it is no such thing lydia does not leave me because she is married	 2.3533755793639255
at the request of mr bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him	 2.5938392444688416

derbyshire and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not	 2.3805089969628206
not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked	 2.4728291245931593
their sisters wedding day arrived and jane and elizabeth felt for her	 2.6639822872714274
whatever my connections may be said elizabeth if your nephew does	 2.3930140760691283
other	 3.6877926458236567
in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate	 3.738835858033573
the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact	 2.3062506005707064
you can now have nothing farther to say she resentfully answered	 2.393065629572583
poor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his	 3.0352982374423227
they last changed horses see the postilions and try if any thing could	 2.8476346649956303
meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they	 2.4068245220895994
say you to the day i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well	 2.475666431065469
of what might be called economy in her own private expences she	 3.5226884667212386
admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard	 3.0832638867295734
laughingly answered	 3.273030879301832
him conditionally only	 3.233216632248557
pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more	 3.3667827222364286
farther by his account of their present quarters and the very great	 3.6341327823598757
lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia had	 2.8293345963314214
liable to you for actual direct indirect consequential punitive or	 3.8214609481853707
you want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it	 3.028552821901875
added i shall insist on their giving one also i shall tell colonel	 2.5316328527830443

because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from	 5.245415432660646
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and	 2.7673436700827656
magnitude you last night laid to my charge the first mentioned	 2.535677167760173
such a risk but against this there were objections and she finally	 2.778863658861555

something and then they soon found out what was the matter	 2.563358869834014
town in the hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he	 3.1378317822286
catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which	 3.8956104850353688
chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on	 2.274707731311981
days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to	 2.852858146786384
either now seriously what have you ever known of selfdenial and	 2.5364448617479662

they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother mrs bennet	 2.9568262971429604

and that said mrs reynolds pointing to another of the miniatures	 3.6054622506879985
kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the	 2.617696488506921
when this information was given and they had all taken their seats mr	 2.33402438204502
her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal	 3.4211640746820846
my dear sir replied mr collins i am particularly obliged to you	 2.7146175722397072
pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they	 3.067358803605299
methey were excessively sorry to go but so they always are the dear	 2.152766306019804

others affectation of candour is common enoughone meets it every	 3.7873738562159462
pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of	 3.8193410527403695

absolutely settled you will have a charming motherinlaw indeed and	 2.879973452292365
janei certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her	 2.7174499310102185
is not this nice is not this an agreeable surprise	 2.8698848684577913
not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character	 3.4151030255129236
i do i do like him she replied with tears in her eyes i love him	 2.8215443419390707
his attachment excited gratitude his general character respect but she	 2.250428868247857
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very	 2.6791179191900163
unconnected with his general powers about ten or a dozen years ago	 2.5567362713823996
mr collins was punctual to his time and was received with great	 3.322582935154363
but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus	 3.6060520032318113
triumph the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of	 2.89505286175573
who i shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the	 2.862833327180394
it he must find it out	 2.8682184201918774
nothing of that who should suffer but myself it has been my own doing	 2.56077433393885
bennets means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband	 3.2434981037783444
no not at all	 3.25590131360708

catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to	 2.5425166244390875
oh certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity we will	 2.605847073573129
i give to hear your strictures on them	 2.5133115889820994
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane but she would not	 3.7905351742270876
without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing	 2.348900321852258
be made out from them his principal object must be to discover the	 2.5051587619969697
to me again by letter for the presentation his circumstances he	 2.73399490967584
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent	 4.028877191302157
the evening and might now come to enquire particularly after her but	 2.425189825948795
when i am in town it is pretty much the same they have each their	 2.2586889571145763
to be always so guarded and circumspect it is very often nothing but	 4.192082822185913
him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not to believe	 3.3702343226428133
a friendly eye	 3.361539025529995
when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having	 2.7798317531486023
done	 3.762776694535401
book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a	 3.504835110384848
was never alluded to but as no such delicacy restrained her mother an	 3.604580589518456
affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in	 2.254780049936329
own judgment of her situation the note was immediately dispatched and	 2.81553243401326
that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged she would not	 3.7309268290585025
strong inducement his revenge would have been complete indeed	 4.504664343201431
forster say had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement	 3.2384133322775464
catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a	 2.84591915570799
aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused	 2.561968988704148
i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong	 2.6389295263103185
her eyes envied every one to whom he spoke had scarcely patience	 2.533858576989746
he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being	 3.6523614700089113
shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday	 3.0171165143890506
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i	 3.56094010075855
his cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear	 2.8209351129365645
afterwards visited mrs bingley and talked of mrs darcy may be guessed	 2.505354983607296
permission and without paying copyright royalties special rules	 3.7271484245562787
aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if	 3.5681395181310243
that is all very proper and civil i am sure said mrs bennet and i	 3.1087257766097114
you	 3.2431020443048393
i do not know mrs bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to	 2.6244404463491366
himintimate as you are you must know how it is to be done	 2.9742079353302495
that she had no disinclination for it	 4.090685263405825
regained her composure and calmly replied	 2.6266709647063187
i am afraid mr darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper	 2.417410721472721
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the	 3.288645899032541
creating the works from public domain print editions means that no	 2.7926862983262457
within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so	 2.6803180556244817
away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and mrs	 2.6512621725101817
turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated	 2.893757419446515
chapter xxiii	 1.9484968389608204
seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choicea sacrifice to	 3.056529780002562
thank you said lydia for if you did i should certainly tell you	 2.4196918003791525
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the	 4.353377165510104
by the author of sense and sensibility	 3.111655239718347
it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he	 3.749760854754386
she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her	 2.663145073180604
the young ladies mrs collins i am glad it occurred to me to mention	 3.0460918763889664
she had heard and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it	 2.843436521654047
dreadful bitterness of spirit	 3.28429520327729
too long and too well to be a fair judge it is impossible for me to	 2.815763671737351
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him their eyes	 2.919991962913803
assertion of her brothers being partial to miss darcy she paid no	 3.1627503717666845
how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr darcy	 2.685280524389432
wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much	 2.2868961442534634
have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the	 2.8432336224116432
the kingdom he promises fairly and i hope among different people	 4.450382790205798
scheme of infamy my poor father how he must have felt it	 2.7258797217887807
wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the	 3.32931267959427
do	 3.4070393401160985
was to leave meryton in a week or fortnights time as that was the	 2.488424460055683
opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost his affection was	 2.424464406401834
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared	 2.8928630905472486
with astonishment and disdain i wonder you took the trouble of coming	 2.8308977132288495
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr gardiner after	 2.4956191365095686
yours sincerely c	 3.0034326613922295
the whole of the matter secondly she was very sure that mr collins	 3.604027412913777
would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy and with regard to the	 3.4123957237249254
resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her	 4.07199300062301
agreeable or otherwise i am not qualified to form one i have known him	 2.9581384779833173
but of this answer lydia heard not a word she seldom listened to any	 2.3307846261474814
are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all	 3.299819672039296
i am sure i know none so handsome but in the gallery up stairs you	 2.7866033113206763
her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their	 2.7006541752946434
family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and	 3.296884252281726
expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of	 3.6408269008907674
created	 1.9905095457977273
her was amazingbut to speak with such civility to enquire after her	 3.1968502465079154
greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her	 3.7666308150196386

engaged to mr collins my dear charlotteimpossible	 3.197558124922362
with my mother up stairs she will be down in a moment i dare say	 2.9559818404298848
nor can i find there was any intention of being so but if you are	 2.665291242039872
only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his	 2.9495501570375655

<NUMBER> to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt	 3.3252490859301123
mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men	 4.186998462568528
be as light as a feather	 3.032111004415471
they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the	 2.731255680124894
this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can	 2.6585811753828845
by the author of sense and sensibility	 3.111655239718347
i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth i am	 2.5417019257359708

philips first brought her the news well so much the better not that	 2.358559148658877

them into harmony and plenty	 3.288156951068143
while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the	 2.454489151508388
oh yesof that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt poor	 2.298950355605365
him as now when all love must be vain	 2.4822832419980636
lessening the honour of my cousins triumph very sadly	 2.836766670910962
and this is your real opinion this is your final resolve very well i	 2.888078570945031
kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry	 2.3232184272107923

for the indulgence of some music miss bingley moved with alacrity to	 4.277909993477446
their reception at home was most kind mrs bennet rejoiced to see jane	 3.1615561846692253

she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the	 2.8700079793207705
miss bingleys eyes were instantly turned towards darcy and she had	 2.383718420274842
by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not	 2.2963396722232785
her father lifted up his eyes jane was distressed elizabeth looked	 2.4810697254479233
as handsome as any of them mr bingley might like you the best of the	 2.5298137422670517
she is a great fool for going away if she liked him	 2.602143583354826
brotherbecause he does not write with ease he studies too much for	 2.8583480351006143
particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him	 2.741104751161066
his mind was visible in every feature he was struggling for the	 4.779556625703974
he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down	 2.7741617610496885

mr collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed	 4.237735393049574
join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but	 3.1953710287142183

elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed	 2.916531440071858

shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked	 2.6942538942918026
darcys sister as by wickhams account she would make him abundantly	 2.3529676427273976
but what said she after a pause can have been his motivewhat	 2.541743048173565
mr collins and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning	 2.9143211018569857

but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what	 3.395690116147818
without the ceremony of a formal invitation bingley was all grateful	 3.3239983595595026
voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for	 3.368924981741402
respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of	 2.7165011828464034
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse	 2.551859597142724
thought and think only of what will make me happy your affection	 2.348981290785857
moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had	 2.8655091167233446
imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to	 3.0656553729829636
here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know	 2.8519136133354217
that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely	 2.768130496745721
and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him	 2.5875291298781913
darcys character though he had assured her that respect for the	 2.676803166903896
done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in	 2.3491204875015086

post by themselves it is highly improper you must contrive to send	 2.8552931376055763
your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you my mind was more	 3.1865443203788097
from b intending to trace their route he did trace them easily to	 3.9745174150185885
extraordinary stretch of belief it was reasonable that he should feel	 2.7329060823629363

mrs bennet treasured up the hint and trusted that she might soon have	 4.129993281882835
supposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps till the	 2.294673419807544

he paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed to	 2.457048760506953

something of these distressing scenes but now as the first shock	 3.6202564026918855

were every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him	 2.6259867476831977
first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her	 3.629519234716676
for any thing more lady catherine will not think the worse of you for	 2.4959989788181716
this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour	 3.749664812511813
mr collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had	 3.596231942348222
she had herself endured on a similar occasion five and twenty years	 2.6890837948742488
any body as he has done by poor wickham he has not an illnatured	 2.5781774690943613
accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as i am	 2.8620989187155046
was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one	 2.352662521796012
lucases i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says	 2.992419113741166
bingley was uncivil to her and more teazing than usual to himself	 4.23827928896452
uncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little change	 3.2677837011919966
pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of	 2.8015961669683573
oh it is of no consequence i shall see her in january but do you	 2.7301511446887665
suiting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at	 2.8159286523385805
materially concerned it was painful exceedingly painful to know that	 2.4664087701511077
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own	 3.010602702461719
she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had	 4.824871527556169
coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after	 2.5147622242570935
his misfortunes repeated darcy contemptuously yes his misfortunes	 2.4325059555799786
into a hackneycoach and dismissed the chaise that brought them	 3.747472824770503
in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an	 2.4887196121600437
the housekeeper came a respectablelooking elderly woman much less	 3.1625254730672356
her turn was coming soon mrs bennet could not give her consent or	 2.3979393303906233
impatiently met her at the door of the dressingroom to ask why lady	 3.597162723560739
my discernmenti who have valued myself on my abilities who have	 3.022335881620997
must have gone through	 3.164140284539162
prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her	 4.64783918614082

word processing or hypertext form however if you provide access to or	 2.86652743823169
quite escaped my notice	 3.0382276396328094
had been overrated elizabeth had never yet answered mrs gardiners	 3.0944440014486876
i learnt to my own family had his character been known this could not	 2.4184575216835
though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the	 4.359691927694499
as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than	 2.461147302096002
disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of	 3.0603374939474817
	 3.3657509935834304
the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one	 2.3115522076959123
remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of	 2.8921335015325123

first circles allow me to say however that your fair partner does not	 2.41812916038224
while	 3.7116428483861803
you mean to frighten me mr darcy by coming in all this state to hear	 2.746056283170478
they had never seen before of most gentlemanlike appearance walking	 2.5104038930616306
ruin your happiness you do not make allowance enough for difference of	 2.97443381347316
perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page she	 2.7210067264408404
unhappy do not distress me by the idea i am not ashamed of having been	 2.685469179925396
spelling and hyphen changes have been made so that there is consistency	 3.180974577771281
be seen the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable	 3.3318349066460393
now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly	 2.4014043982867483
absolutely resolved on remaining where she was she cared for none	 3.4841488284783595
mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has	 2.533726018736001
acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her	 2.6057277608688003
connexion was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so	 3.2765674902962747
him he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very	 2.491677848478491
miss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she	 3.9130353072716333
she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued	 2.87936065873396
i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind your	 3.3458731992659123
between the two gentlemen but though jane would have defended either or	 2.8554272407176438
he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it	 2.5748578163494367
almost a week after the gentlemens arrival that they were honoured by	 3.1745721415253856
this is an evening of wonders indeed and so darcy did every thing	 2.568857098771885
then flow in i appeal to mr darcybut let me not interrupt you	 3.4360018345602064
referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam	 2.8923743928344146
in a few days mr bingley returned mr bennets visit and sat about ten	 2.29576041258022
amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds	 2.8678438708869987
and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without	 3.2900931839055154
situation and his expectation of a young olivebranch but lizzy you	 2.777674780002148
us whether it is like or not	 2.5018983109673245
they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth	 2.917278834494846
which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open	 2.5856085898014816
increased by every review of it that she should receive an offer of	 3.2884789114926147
first got abroad it hastened his journey	 3.1145650660950954
purport of his letter was to inform them that mr wickham had resolved	 3.6460422725928527
conversation which had been passing while mr and mrs gardiner were	 3.281563029650725
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley	 3.1492893519613157
oh yes said elizabeth drilymr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr	 2.7122088623501233
themselves what a contrast between him and his friend mr darcy danced	 3.1561921987699493
in the first place replied mr gardiner there is no absolute proof	 2.9775007449720903
pleasantest preservative from want this preservative she had now	 3.268786759129515
handsome thought upon the whole i am much pleased with him	 2.752434633715158
elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to	 2.8246546820532337
it is nothing in comparison of rosings my lady i dare say but i	 2.5550390207180365
arrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her dressingroom window	 3.231786912617384
other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did	 2.849502578112551
desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of	 3.0168148047391914
entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he	 2.6431429704585008
conviction as truly as i wished it in reasonmy objections to	 2.97399228164799
them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the	 3.4867221295044106
more than he did himself	 2.969428526480262
to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse	 3.017414928848315
this was a lucky recollectionit saved her from something like regret	 3.866727592338456
such a fuss i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put	 2.824989615662097
such an evil	 3.3860949619893157
asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as	 3.5537998793655703
observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been	 2.999727617734578
with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equally	 2.806181511918014
wanted in the farm mr bennet are not they	 3.706287904472182
produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sisters	 2.717429083318001
could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickhams name	 2.96681377311228
officers names and connections their lodgings were not long a secret	 2.615644461970151
some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it	 3.228545362135752
nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself as to	 2.411919912951706
principle	 1.9905095457977273

i leave it to yourself to determine said mr bennet	 2.701381119922382
the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no	 3.170369727784791

in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying	 2.460845824313459

elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit	 3.4051964719393077

no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her	 2.882876845177455
her niece however did her justice and pitied her	 2.570683417537562

to such perseverance in wilful selfdeception elizabeth would make no	 4.20107137824295
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through	 4.625650650267158
with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance	 3.797754205702294
who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had she	 2.443269471504625

whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate	 4.274618907838812
sorry that mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so	 3.7676119498372898
known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love	 2.1512998525836386

answer let me do it without farther loss of time accept my thanks for	 2.2508098911666856
to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you	 3.365163872352493
oh my dear lydia she cried when shall we meet again	 2.292920052340074
to dine at rosings the next day	 3.2715128516966168
much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of	 2.71362596084423

unsuitable a match the strangeness of mr collinss making two offers	 3.339843346744225
now accepted she had always felt that charlottes opinion of matrimony	 2.5136399253285107
adieu is charity itself but think no more of the letter the feelings	 3.539726956305409
you are rather disposed to call his interference officious	 2.303264669600357
netherfield for was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed	 3.230991849649754
will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write againat	 2.878487750521617
check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence	 3.0018057179651327
during their walk it was resolved that mr bennets consent should be	 2.2430406708835844
in general satisfactory mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor	 3.0307552765804204
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware	 2.711475943548719
me would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it	 3.018167106547814
come to netherfield if he likes it and who knows what may happen	 3.091720645953225
thing she ever did she seems perfectly happy however and in a	 2.31683054368625
miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a	 2.5830431288861373
reserve to mrs collins and whatever might be his feelings towards her	 2.902040618440029
for every fish he won and apologising if he thought he won too many	 4.081053641394297
exactly in unison with her opinion of each	 3.6167672044130543
oh my dear father she cried come back and write immediately	 2.340696222778165

which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the roommany	 2.914157409661822

frame so that he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like	 3.6254076830166397
she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale with	 4.748555273445427
bennet with little cessation of his house and garden at hunsford such	 3.1653361030160796

as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption	 2.6851178946940086
mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his	 2.9012721623766047
his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade	 2.598252648964773
well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingleybutgood	 3.415848996031453
way that would induce you to accept me	 3.305117278743397
did not know the whole story before the end of the day	 3.573109305232102

trouble of finding a subject to him	 2.774105804740012
moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was	 3.1907490375502077
them mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding	 3.3707490023433135
father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have	 3.3216740577078085
genteel and so easyhe has always something to say to every	 2.743579733351539
which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your	 3.601888250951355
of shame was severe the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly	 2.9074003754791287
form any alternate format must include the full project gutenbergtm	 2.9986508575807282
otherwise if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or	 3.1152951126617685
my spirits will not bear solitude i must have employment and society	 3.0640679816743166
reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only	 2.8497797824751334
congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever	 3.8531335049301605
pride and prejudice	 2.588900692104667
not appear in the least affected by it he was always to have gone on	 2.482881593466767
collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of	 3.1441720616909374
she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses	 2.9415534078929073
one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him i could not	 3.3252103276542155

beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste they were	 3.037245632914033
readiness and ease of a wellbred man and talked very pleasantly but	 3.1801119825667574
for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in	 3.0904591339277143
to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of	 2.6942659911754103
of them good for any thing take your choice but you must be satisfied	 2.63651805437995
ease cannot write ill	 2.8038186019761797
thinking their mutual affection will steady them and i flatter myself	 2.6822354648920284
elizabeth bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other	 3.0992455953952147
and every body began to find out that they had always distrusted the	 3.141840379392982

when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it and	 2.6445056853681193
that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth	 2.6293055278469444
admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did but	 2.8519191310022056
from what we have seen of him continued mrs gardiner i really	 2.451670197796746
her hopes as her fears and after talking with her in this manner till	 3.265628929870765
if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to	 2.749513257045324
almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcy	 2.7983952280435327
instruct though we can teach only what is not worth knowing forgive	 2.3765158618227087
did not always love him so well as i do now but in such cases as these	 2.6448719465755617
but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them	 3.4548010342345115
being married before three and twenty my aunt philips wants you so to	 2.471687092378264
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice he was fond of	 3.249523503712427
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so	 2.9743801062439696
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours the horses	 3.5739417819541512

servants remained but when they had withdrawn he said to her mrs	 2.9428343768724368
impenetrably grave she looked at her father to entreat his	 3.5356849897207834

i am grieved indeed cried darcy grievedshocked but is it	 2.6870657553805333
her	 3.0042033107432116
consideration in the world replied darcy	 3.4103066950461947
serious attachmenti had often seen him in love beforeat that	 2.720019756543209
it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to	 3.3072619373251526
i never want to see him again but however he is very welcome to	 2.7688038122718095
acquaintance the subjection in which his father had brought him up had	 3.110022848721127
dared not lift up her eyes how mr darcy looked therefore she could	 2.580729284315239
remember eliza that he does not know janes disposition as you do	 2.7643018569048574
as likely to give any news of him and in the wretched state of his own	 3.354976157542695

attachment to rosings certainly increases	 2.7744584007908126
follypleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect	 3.7114826896171946

lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said	 3.5633083624341326
myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley	 2.628033034365111
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite in this danger kitty	 2.8631516458049333

esteem and confidence had vanished for ever and all his views of	 2.9409653984785753
mr darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said you cannot	 2.652319909372488
gratitudefor to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such	 3.415880528812562
mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent	 2.4819250140523463
in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped	 3.86432510867306
it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of	 2.4636601010256456

other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it	 3.3460184629232677
indeed mr collins all praise of me will be unnecessary you must	 2.8090673658887937
placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find	 3.203380679419099
listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away	 3.0597091326244086
inferior to what elizabeth felt	 2.886564823857765

darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet	 2.5894982422090327
she answered him with cold civility he sat down for a few moments and	 2.4701803045126898
charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and	 2.535690132488485
while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we	 3.184155612073747
catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but lydia with perfect	 3.1668812460047615
which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be	 4.466729442051031
i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr	 2.5737932758804436

take his guest into the drawingroom again and when tea was over glad	 2.809047490895941
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and	 3.38407804810919
own future property the dinner too in its turn was highly admired and	 2.2955107597457483
conceal your age	 2.978451310619869
being at home again in a day or two jane was already so much recovered	 2.4415219280616856
mr darcy is not to be laughed at cried elizabeth that is an	 3.29668092304256
such splendid expectations he had rather hoped that all his wifes	 3.636828421313595
it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose	 2.4904723008799254
lady catherine seemed pleased	 2.816269742072854

mean to be unhappy about him	 2.6006994526978526

elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the	 5.350232320618348

loud that any body might have heard us ten miles off	 2.3781422712784868
you have said quite enough madam i perfectly comprehend your	 2.1894176992888834

you shall not deceive me i know it to be impossible	 3.5958485258526895
also more intelligible	 3.134445268324161
jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail	 4.170303381585837
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting	 2.3729207856926684

fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their	 2.6548241458818245
bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the	 3.1269353508776443
advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though	 2.325386701632234
one i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady	 2.600511745632773
and all the articles of plate which mr collins had promised and as he	 3.9044050284733864

chapter xviii	 1.9484968389608204
but youhow are you cried elizabeth you look pale how much you	 2.688619992402047
let me write for you said jane if you dislike the trouble	 2.2631765140930105
the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and	 3.221522272645473
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man but whether she	 4.10208525630978
as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not	 2.4842437533165302
minutes before the others appeared and he took the opportunity of	 2.677057464120736
think it will be very tolerable besides it will not much signify what	 3.2193616295537892
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and	 2.961560532261076
sake of discovering them	 3.0316613686984537
very bad it is almost past belief and poor mr darcy dear lizzy only	 2.085179841524955
she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information	 2.4422732048602223
company i am sure	 3.4775304815515846
i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy	 3.4849645850115856
directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing	 2.9012964914716735
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give	 2.7340452565514592
what could be the meaning of itit was impossible to imagine it was	 3.1046279249019033
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was	 2.743778856155117
i wish i could say any thing to comfort you replied elizabeth but	 2.519675895257403
last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a	 2.4999923395779433
and mrs hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and	 4.434949949853157
it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an illnatured tone that	 3.5058058118739632
for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle and you saw the	 2.8406693115475306
persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to	 3.4437732787810718
i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon	 3.0303079267543884
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in	 2.4913882800079685
the place immediately and mrs younge was of course removed from	 2.810388253162011
and jane and for their sakes had patience with her mr darcy was	 4.227315373716554
family jane heard them with horror a gamester she cried this is	 2.999564684005775
a long dispute followed this declaration but mr bennet was firm it	 3.0505534901649507
acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had	 2.3603697424903407
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his	 4.25455992763668
her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach	 2.448831774703028

foundation as set forth in section <NUMBER> below	 2.6905881901770607
while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend	 2.8002955251776087
not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals	 2.706534131342391
noi feel he may defy us there and as to laughter we will not expose	 2.9936690549676137
of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit it amazes	 2.8572913480598947
added	 3.8231859880236057
connection he had to be sure done much she was ashamed to think how	 2.6937285921024587
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and	 2.3882735650534648
next day	 3.3517435293211326
my object then replied darcy was to shew you by every civility	 2.9491974872566593
present elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was	 3.89420679011026
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then	 2.507267483606105
people could be meant than those with whom she was connected there	 2.2554659578825706
go my dear cried her mother and shew her ladyship about the	 3.178256368889206
which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving	 2.807655114428511
had often great enjoyment out of doors her favourite walk and where	 2.925718430983313
together after a short silence the lady first spoke she wished him to	 2.4652338512029384
hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered	 3.0851349524039438
almost no restrictions whatsoever you may copy it give it away or	 2.487409290066934
in observed	 3.3049951101939175
and advised them to do it differently found fault with the arrangement	 3.343493768604063
much reluctance	 3.2967140791707688
short duration the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the	 2.546828153850253
of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many	 2.7777550373995634
wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing	 3.132636462617351
i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourites guilt	 3.331803910003007
were placed lady catherine sir william and mr and mrs collins sat	 3.184886649079402
walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party	 3.1539597071630348
his pocket but perhaps you would like to read it	 2.921923111083264
industriously circulated by yourselves do you not know that such a	 3.32752523918877
grieved for him his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost he	 3.54080638597266
unless he really comes to see her	 2.7777815088588254
heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his	 4.326216762934566
he then told her of georgianas delight in her acquaintance and of her	 2.519680344137141
not by when i told mamma and the others all about it are not you	 2.8446752340121524
the former faults of any person without knowing what their present	 2.801704478885145
excuse my interferenceit was kindly meant	 3.667358266730853
miss bennet paused a little and then replied surely there can be no	 2.907956264982592
how long has she been such a favouriteand pray when am i to wish you	 2.7541793775000003
every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief	 3.3902031184233348
herself with and one too who had probably been his own companion from	 2.222172920096104
probably notbut mr darcy can please where he chuses he does not	 2.892665176305295
bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart	 2.651315231347121
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a	 3.1631699492156464
the first grand object of every mornings impatience through letters	 3.3126619933537493
are provoking me to it every moment	 3.1920488979643062
much but he saw only the father the ladies were somewhat more	 2.470926845334182
help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a	 2.817976657508585
depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them	 2.460030537352677
while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enoughi	 3.1514315643554425
his daughters request for such it might be considered of being	 2.4445399842182245
and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt let me hear	 3.13881841451324
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure	 3.540184363861966
pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to youif from no better	 2.6607501440454455
view of the house with weary ancles dirty stockings and a face	 4.940047298138419
parsonage	 3.8510132836991624
been unable to give him a gentlemans education my father was not	 3.517528008171039
in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to	 3.6372101152842213
soon led to another and mrs bennet found with amazement and horror	 2.763760376380874
ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great	 3.4731351196690508
amongst the most violent against him was mrs bennet whose dislike of	 2.6615667496531734
will save all the best of the covies for you	 4.714173099548251
miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he	 2.6665998825149
gardiner but perhaps to the lakes	 2.9847720799492117
partiality is not misleading me i think when i call charles most	 2.948132310586878
in general are not more like her does she live near you sir	 2.14704245699621
on these occasions mrs gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeths	 2.93738394640274
i am sure said she i cried for two days together when colonel	 2.4980666552550876
mr collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight but his	 2.841205400913882
outside the united states us laws alone swamp our small staff	 2.5734232796862178
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you your	 2.3796374468626684
incomprehensible but now it was all too natural for such an attachment	 2.629551429960586
renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting	 2.6943782038037387
not yet learnt to condemn themwith respect to that other more	 2.9070111576878164
effectually to what they related mr darcy who never looks at any	 2.4413833218973426
by teatime however the dose had been enough and mr bennet was glad to	 3.493194641863405
international donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make	 2.4825257390915323
pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited	 2.705243710809954
kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe	 3.0323106212659834
private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before	 3.087641530816405
did conquer her fathers incredulity and reconcile him to the match	 4.132772368702142
absence	 3.8839287618450284
gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the	 3.763418600020195
indeed you are mistaken i have no such injuries to resent it is not	 4.215370447423041
the most agreeable man i ever sawand if he becomes really attached to	 2.767369928860786
conversation	 3.7801106842729464
settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly	 2.5429449366760917
clothes the wedding clothes i will write to my sister gardiner about	 2.2571376789810844
having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in	 2.257804380209865
such a striking civility as miss darcys in coming to them on the very	 2.609587007189663
continue the subject	 3.427790877356361
her unwillingness to see mr darcy it determined her not to attend her	 3.342226300704118
him happy if they had my friend has an excellent understandingthough	 2.6085145337295876
me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could	 2.6076672828147256
i comfort myself with thinking replied jane that he certainly would	 2.3425589082801626
carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if	 2.9289651174095
mr darcy bowed	 3.4371657137559786
could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other	 3.449842729469738
the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard mr darcy	 2.679302549742955
two girls had the honour of assisting mrs jenkinson to make up her	 3.4795092888666472
end of vol i	 3.220172337432011
he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling he	 3.0149671075060547
continued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joined	 4.310871322604871
thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears	 3.35523009020471
appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed	 2.5638598488627835
tranquillity	 1.9905095457977273
wickhams alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated	 3.180969289536031
how should you have liked making sermons	 2.628200300972437
such a clue as that it might be of essential consequence at present we	 3.1335902350590294
conversation with the ladies and sir william to elizabeths high	 2.4261849193841605
whether all her sisters were at longbourn there was not much in the	 2.8827193703736143
how i should like to be married before any of you and then i would	 3.04286338353462
warm commendation of him narrowly observed them both without supposing	 2.7886910737730757
to insist upon her marrying him	 3.031035085452341
till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him	 3.1488035087435704
cousins conduct does not suit my feelings why was he to be the judge	 2.895955762160809
necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence	 3.0237721950263574
resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her	 3.1851524756177403
being spoke to	 3.080792924407787
longbourn mr gardiner was a sensible gentlemanlike man greatly	 2.5714408240333544
present unknown she saw all the glories of the camp its tents	 3.9516273841270877
next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky	 2.877111800107156
some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn	 2.7726057509866795
distribute copies of a project gutenbergtm work in a format other than	 3.3454277782139115
said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of	 2.5490869137011183
extraordinary one after my declaration i do assure you that i am not	 3.3581055906417627
to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was	 3.1025506282209
situation	 3.7853002271045466
rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private	 3.8839149297732884
well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart and if	 2.347193268125823
darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily	 2.8267956402583847
us compliments always take you by surprise and me never what	 2.3854535954603806
meryton thought she might as well call on you i suppose she had	 2.4298485940204553
darcy she was directly retreating but the person who advanced was now	 2.8734237115729235
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer	 2.52329158620087
la replied kitty it looks just like that man that used to be with	 2.1554942151977965
spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to	 4.298158091770577
seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much	 4.001648659740277

seeking him up stairs with their mother when they were met by the	 2.595493348818096

i will make her know it	 2.7111632371077303
of my philosophy think only of the past as its remembrance gives you	 3.788430208507086
from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was	 2.5267312906634007

and jane seem so well to understand	 2.6082920648178542
estate that is not lawfully their own so much the better i should be	 3.2759822234843554
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months	 2.5836525803369654
their father from a different quarter from mr collins which as jane	 2.6633643203109973
one most reluctant smile never had his wit been directed in a manner so	 2.993456425572506
believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to	 3.40404203465884
conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her	 3.0990356877026928
with what the owner said in its praise and took it immediately	 2.50667855785731
subject	 3.439042945543513
she held out her hand he kissed it with affectionate gallantry though	 3.033472858333511
the day of his and lydias departure soon came and mrs bennet was	 2.7350427219169218
accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those	 2.5649199215389396

extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her	 2.9500043039453723
that he was so well convinced of lady catherines discernment as to be	 3.2146463507856065
a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to	 2.6903672348236576
principally offended mr darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct	 3.9150652580627496
of his friend for though jane had the most generous and forgiving	 3.2595697851390577
take whatever you like and get away	 2.530015692377861
after they are married and above all things keep mr bennet from	 2.310336103043144
and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a	 3.638868178186909
any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such	 2.655714768807689
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any	 2.523968167531742

point as well as the still more interesting one of bingleys being	 2.6641320487532485
respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked	 2.7448933339078794
pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those	 3.5870165779151955
make after all their hertfordshire friends elizabeth construing all	 2.425099045723694
lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in	 3.114707488526447
but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sisters	 2.6859125133238084
down for two dances and during part of that time mr darcy had been	 2.474425480047723
mr gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from	 2.4807529845609517

i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza	 2.424586488901476
in as short a time as mr collinss long speeches would allow every	 2.2559339565992778

you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him	 2.4900175900985775
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible advice which there	 3.2279388502088455
oh charlotte says she hardly ever does it is the greatest of favours	 2.444085122510486
acquaintance but that is all i have nothing either to hope or fear	 2.818202223231899
evening said elizabeth the conduct of neither if strictly examined	 2.4743869720504654
of music then pray speak aloud it is of all subjects my delight i	 2.408604139371038

reflection by every thing but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence	 2.7417142490044992
yes or i will never see her again	 2.6632443871958027
likely to be in this country much longer	 3.2644346249402982
must not let your fancy run away with you you have sense and we all	 2.4618409281606746
sake turning to charlotte i am glad of it but otherwise i see no	 2.541622258648072
following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed	 3.341312819097021
the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more	 2.5868965172320686
i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her	 2.7905172920571997
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment	 2.9132415934461733
mr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted	 2.591584432476068
if it was to be secret said jane say not another word on the	 3.103183306763911
paid him but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own	 2.893495134107502
it	 3.040429572705547
not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and	 2.777808205140981
	 3.3657509935834304
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other	 2.6525478963005433
my dear niece	 3.015758759115098
longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife	 2.8709133104133877
ridicule	 1.9905095457977273
but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the	 2.4255558737156275
that he is always here so often it is on your account that he has been	 2.6545509145596187
ten days time he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably	 2.4846621598641456
enquiry after the health of her family she answered with equal	 2.475590189213955
he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were and that	 2.4902907032085455
he is a sweet tempered amiable charming man he cannot know what mr	 3.2456764426792857
unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in and i hope my dinners	 2.465964746527662
his will be disregardedwhy did not you seek legal redress	 4.25046259167566
which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against	 2.6721801325532493
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire	 3.5292022728184747
indifferent would have prevented his coming down again	 2.5566740369962084
pitied	 1.9905095457977273
jane who were dancing together recovering himself however shortly	 2.3325089320467254
she did indeed louisa i could hardly keep my countenance very	 2.594660369452853
mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then	 2.447074789617449
miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction	 2.5891529665147446
of them talk fast enough and wickham who happened to sit near	 2.259493256328654
field after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springing	 4.274429441505211
sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth	 2.4918537166938517
immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of	 3.5982920560660414
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon	 2.7171629330131513
sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they	 2.7969295323882584
charlotte once or twice she could discern a faint blush but in general	 4.129601913172667
a misfortune to be liked by him mrs long told me last night that he	 2.5880247434213937
are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady	 2.418800837843004
hatefully mercenary and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer	 3.346618759676159
they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while	 4.958424540003071
family never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified	 2.478127341288829
well thensupposing them to be in london they may be there though	 3.3000314103880064
of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man	 3.0329888707453003
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever	 3.6736993943394665
she was still dear to him perhaps he had been civil only because he	 2.4994831834544766
having them all to dine with her	 3.034601468322069
uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the	 3.3645027927579467
no one made any reply she then yawned again threw aside her book and	 2.8853119558864986
what can be the meaning of this said charlotte as soon as he was	 2.769728176347565
and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending	 2.537292757998904
with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia	 2.7145229364349284
were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere	 3.1128334702647136
they each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with mr	 2.237393682874341
could only tell her nieces what they already knew that mr denny had	 2.2847176872185107
elizabeth said to her	 3.0955380095756877
and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him	 2.4401065466189786
against a young woman of lydias connections which is not likely	 2.6104834536066637
you mistake me my dear i have a high respect for your nerves they	 3.250377099888539
but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when	 2.522169679533899
a word about it till now	 2.836344450348197
to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must soon	 2.5604944764063435
expected her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment	 3.450431565877796
entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely to	 2.71957940744339
evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of its	 2.752047989704951
liked a red coat myself very welland indeed so i do still at my heart	 2.7564359706050197
wondered it had escaped her before she saw the indelicacy of putting	 3.267588229743756
going on in the country as in town	 2.8250531307023556
attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility	 3.003547002680387
you know nothing of the matter that is all to be forgot perhaps i	 3.625156741408557
yes maam all	 3.1114120155765135
unreserved correspondence i depend on you for that to these high	 2.456969399291256
were indisposed maria thought speaking out of the question and the	 2.6504142615870765
pay	 3.884279052966975
opinion that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the	 3.099717925857566

had voluntarily done for lydia he heard her with astonishment	 2.4529541619054087
surprised to find that he meditated a quick return mrs bennet wished	 3.1978172701081324
compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than	 3.954150676954961
when the ladies returned to the drawingroom there was little to be	 2.7316968471866336
with great energybut it is a subject which always makes a lady	 3.4343761861722633
ready to take them all home	 2.6546654355521304
a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she	 2.8853775296787316
their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to	 4.211526112098044
jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their	 3.6277885871163265
when i have bought some prettiercoloured satin to trim it with fresh i	 4.901540844325516

so very guarded if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill	 3.183709498349204
him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by i only fear that	 3.8239959851558734
give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london	 2.743781037994442
them from mr darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to	 3.481600651218861
yes vanity is a weakness indeed but pridewhere there is a real	 3.3459238675571967
telling again what had been already written and when it closed	 2.6667581934564413
intelligence every day added something to their knowledge of the	 2.4213035928333393
on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by	 3.747069333145628
with less perplexity her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what	 3.6129709720521745
little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she	 3.2368778057727297
her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind	 2.5200440979078276
that whether married or single he must always be her model of the	 2.91265001105275

posterity with all the eclat of a proverb	 3.8159150398473014
and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it	 2.766361238710044
a great many indeed said her companion with a sigh	 2.725185284512902
thought was still worse not a syllable was uttered by either and	 3.5525534062306865

there was no want of discourse the bride and her mother could neither	 4.554408813173143
good heaven what is to become of us what are we to do would they	 2.6828670581331706
concerns familiarly and minutely and gave her a great deal of advice	 3.288544667491616

would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to	 3.4789922675394944

had there renewed a slight acquaintance of his former way of life	 2.4471367141194826
of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness	 2.8075407676016977

jane oh lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed	 2.3516665003776143
hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the	 2.4207302071867423
they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a	 2.7848572023084
then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your	 2.61809711404919
object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her	 3.3883397743198267
they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me	 2.603158573452797
entering the marriage state	 3.0809498892827594
darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the	 3.093533767367129
airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure girls can i do any	 2.607437412231098
the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not	 2.6871627643625917
conversation with mr gardiner elizabeth could not but be pleased	 2.7796662681577624
which would admit of a chair and on the gentlemens approaching one of	 4.306960614016616
possessed of bringing on the renewal of his addresses	 3.6174227473773057
them as nonsense i cannot quite agree with you there what say you	 2.56312710421642

darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence	 2.7000433346075745

and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it it is	 3.0911776014176215
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than	 3.020187966570672
even to charlottes wishes to be the case and after various	 3.234495359162014
this is quite shockinghe deserves to be publicly disgraced	 3.8954137650825853
supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and	 2.6491449687733777
be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparisonbut	 3.4299882869320295

you an offer of marriage is it true elizabeth replied that it was	 2.507638043753958
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female	 3.8695933517662735
indifference continued to express her admiration of captain carter and	 3.2124356879361238
blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the	 2.7243797805805543
near concern in all his cousins affairs and whose character she had no	 2.805018347863539
that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other	 2.90048381936391
you need not be frightened i never heard any harm of her and i dare	 4.261364376290357
hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to	 2.533070880974445
have received benefit of greater importance	 2.625624645934826
she found herself so affectionately received she saw instantly that her	 2.5064998262567952
determined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets	 2.7939403002194676
what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud	 2.932894984777146
of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted	 2.9894802609308213
you have yes there was something in that i told you so from the	 2.502936674916741
then getting up walked about the room elizabeth was surprised but said	 2.5463983529316945
mrs gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now	 2.793452386338875
lord what will become of me i shall go distracted	 2.834502285642189
an hour after every body else was gone which gave them time to see how	 2.345936524308514
latter was thinking only of his breakfast	 2.5612870673579695
mr philipss house and then made their bows in spite of miss lydias	 2.6663074120265984
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering	 4.608554417676458
thing material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity	 3.8961823192490495
gratification but when mrs philips understood from him what rosings	 2.507815200306062
was all done very well she had also to anticipate how her visit would	 2.2680300686920427

thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on	 2.3312908027748054
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather	 3.9595354463835553
forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means	 3.871986496513323

this sad business of janes for my part i am determined never to speak	 2.3589880921917366
of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness of	 3.554928460055042
resolved that it could be the last resource if her private enquiries as	 2.9910387525777913
i am astonished my dear said mrs bennet that you should be so	 3.024467272055492
her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me if your	 3.902689484383804
their journey gave them directions as to the best method of packing	 3.198560816601214
do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an	 2.7149352468527876
sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham	 2.4684009320204288
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world	 3.3680063655661385

them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they	 2.7511980600167685
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from	 2.5540368421568234
that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more	 3.6778897788943112
out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling to think	 3.8801619467500297
her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him	 2.6190225825506803
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire	 2.9789523533140696
would she have behaved were questions with which she amused herself	 2.795931584414923
the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt it soothed	 4.0804758420336
prevented any public exposure but i wrote to mr wickham who left	 2.9321470993961722
who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of	 2.8519419753006576

elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in	 4.0498469215910475

marked their several meetings in derbyshire and as she threw a	 3.2483956633980973
the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great	 2.510374396369275
collins toowhy should he have it more than anybody else	 2.7891948398939115
reached the carriage mr and mrs gardiner were half a quarter of a	 3.4456140703590785
cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the	 4.165252561522885
mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large	 3.450595675125122
occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself	 2.8774392713403905
to offend mr darcyyou will never recommend yourself to his friend by	 3.0179565564341178
their intending to go off had colonel forster seen denny himself	 2.470445194977754
flirtation and officers have been in her head she has been doing	 2.773221058780155
agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it i am	 2.3070738926411796
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict	 4.36350956740744
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and	 2.6982710821528295
continued her mother but at the same time mr bingley it is very	 3.0695244358654135
gutenberg is a registered trademark and may not be used if you	 3.5543697568077177
longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard it	 3.452714283957032
your affectionate friend	 3.075706980855938
cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified	 2.829347977157243
course of this morning	 3.0896925405595286
feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again in her own past	 2.929817375164515
rapturous air the fine proportion and finished ornaments they followed	 3.5353904404386065
the scheme it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at	 2.9775344030605915
ever was seen	 3.2847803817322494
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at	 2.6443198184686514
event takes placewhich however as i have already said may not be	 3.1524676191633456
in your name throughout the whole of this business i will	 2.7882309272411616
the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only	 3.4498361876213837
such a girl to be my nephews sister is her husband is the son of	 2.3725185486449814
want of attention to other peoples feelings and want of resolution	 2.667588286211674
i enquired after their brother of course he was well but so much	 2.496315319735089
delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of	 3.568619090350472
chapter xix	 1.9484968389608204
characteristic bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier	 2.527744357054548
i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you	 2.9703619300205983
for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any	 2.8707172720393364
communication would therefore do for all after a slight preparation	 2.5379184693686883
the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sir	 2.314277276780889
her purchases look here i have bought this bonnet i do not think it	 3.2974216573804056
and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making	 4.184779571798397
catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying	 2.5234320523790013
his entrance of his having ten thousand a year the gentlemen	 2.672084348297443
which it seems he has been told by some of the goodnatured gossiping	 2.9391815689455587
such a man to be worked on how are they even to be discovered i have	 3.66134796405922
only four dances i am sorry to pain youbut so it was he danced only	 2.7777699647485092
charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling but no	 2.4683917598155176
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property	 2.805716430614575
do you prefer reading to cards said he that is rather singular	 2.689261922261847
due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which	 2.6084136977390764
opinion of hertheir opinion of every bodywould always coincide	 3.0711408097994277
humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at	 2.7407024533232205
i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment	 2.705546684346606
charlotte and a most attentive neighbour	 3.0989430093619945
could most wish for and now do when you get to town find them out	 2.2277741551518373
entered the breakfastroom and congratulated both him and herself in	 3.7420751576038906
my uncle is to send a servant for us	 2.6586284752902505
to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachmans	 3.0400205039999575
invented by mrs bell <NUMBER> charlotte street bedford square	 2.8384017368599728
always write such charming long letters to her mr darcy	 2.371352558718409
have always supposed it to be my own faultbecause i would not take the	 3.3724118178313205
of pleasure was lost in shame she felt anew the justice of mr darcys	 3.033542444097256
politeness there was good humour and kindnessmr darcy said very	 2.5117990777294814
variety of thought reconsidering events determining probabilities	 2.9874579038196734
states compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a	 3.7360860465620975
friend and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a	 2.6511525675823657
then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce	 2.9363429608493528
elizabeth said	 3.3117254003582333
be delighted with her she is all affability and condescension and i	 3.960220466743116
thought she could witness without trepidation	 3.5567657245096753
to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much	 2.781680470236117
again by her sister	 3.0663105171920995
a few days after this visit mr bingley called again and alone his	 2.346051277133824
chapter iii	 1.9484968389608204
father was at leisure to be consulted one days delay she observed	 3.0533642626619186
but only because her husbands regiment happens to be so far off if	 2.883578768018496
gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party but	 2.7370864596484776
into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding	 2.231220042175867
sound and that you would never act in this way yourself	 3.2083392035292135
for continuing their pursuit when mrs bennet was told of this she did	 3.1476348302440766
long speeches of mr collins who was complimenting mr bingley and his	 4.040854155709523
terms of this agreement you may obtain a refund from the person or	 3.8298882480953886
gave way only to the greater distress of mr bingleys continued	 2.7199545902742193
other is miss de bourgh only look at her she is quite a little	 2.8744222261261942
you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me	 3.897432470700787
mrs gardiner then rallied her niece on wickhams desertion and	 2.5428117323520683
oh hang kitty what has she to do with it come be quick be quick	 2.3308787298557445
he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam	 2.8629137139640006
excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your	 3.5342409863781925
they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and mrs bennet in	 2.649398635083987
panegyric of compliment to yourselfand yet what is there so very	 2.3614803559216817
like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to	 2.7102011263480805
thinking there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of	 3.230519389117748
elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such	 3.6874183761832553
astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her she wished	 3.8690704537261422
have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the	 2.4961770476222505
all cared about me we must have met long long ago he knows of my	 2.5444489239412307
choose to be you shall not find me so my character has ever been	 2.6207830291995453
listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all	 2.832160880893049
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic kitty was the	 2.8109062705728154
beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake	 2.5144692006396525
viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and	 2.8564734411921817
so far what could your ladyship propose by it	 2.619240056506158
succeeded for a few moments it was first broken by mrs annesley a	 2.801374356543502
yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word	 2.303535114067913
she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of	 2.6446385760080005
never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as	 3.053365660372749
generations	 1.9905095457977273
received an invitation from mrs forster the wife of the colonel of the	 2.368681031426517
is unaccountable	 3.251772083382057
bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away	 2.5849150260703504
no answer	 3.385423013405462
and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wickham his	 2.926675239303838
more to give	 3.216218241415567
governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have	 2.5359529321532746
elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself	 2.9033771209255224
abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all	 3.3688344752901696
deservedly dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she may	 2.648976488372466
words to her sister ran out of the room	 3.1209707572299887
explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give	 4.483763509381896
many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few	 2.4718794096025
with any of them there was no one therefore who could be pointed out	 3.056611605365182
acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly	 3.37921777233133
confidante	 1.9905095457977273
no said her father wickhams a fool if he takes her with a	 3.469743869913096
were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been	 2.427376620821081
judgment he stands much in awe his fear of her has always operated i	 2.4973813248494383
have sometimes been called so fine i never could perceive any thing	 2.4930801104218534
elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of	 4.789898992105441
of their sight i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their	 2.855068376125409
our own vanity that deceives us women fancy admiration means more than	 2.154159163840351
understand it i shall then give over every expectation every wish of	 2.344999247634558
rained hard her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was	 3.4881588696155217
had elizabeths opinion been all drawn from her own family she could	 2.7612369627846696
politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place	 2.3555254807513935
repinebut to be sure it would have been such a thing for me the	 3.092835578387357
of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration the	 2.464029411381189
hide it not doing its office	 2.604784889010701
increasing	 1.9905095457977273
you that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon	 2.857766845142615
since you went away miss lucas is married and settled and one of my	 2.364081159510118
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish	 3.11859602115236
if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to	 2.543589511193604
north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her	 2.551401650884438
gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before	 3.476899257667756
feel the obliged mr collins was gratified and with a more smiling	 2.8706813230170933
to accept them is absolutely impossible my feelings in every respect	 2.3381502991854184
next saturday	 3.326203224648954
her notice mrs philips was quite awed by such an excess of good	 3.4804028489121968
disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own	 2.3529136238100397
avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world a sense of	 2.9284070049084923
the north of england a circumstance more deeply impressed on their	 3.7264458773636733
a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour	 3.237831276481445
demand it of your justice	 2.9156320197165955
her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her	 3.2159288298249247
no one but mrs bennet regretted that their stay would be so short and	 2.6628775449987945
succeeds but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art	 3.803403278585185
the others returned into the house mr collins no sooner saw the two	 2.3743420427309583
which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely any thing	 2.7547494743724275
walk and turning towards her these offences might have been	 2.652140976730429
pleasure	 3.4289129098105207
regard they had frequently been staying with her in town	 3.122481576083932
the little value he put on his own good qualities	 2.795315320546317
pause who more particularly wishes to be known to youwill you allow	 2.6965633973425214
we will be down as soon as we can said jane but i dare say kitty is	 2.726816518611193
now i am quite happy said she for you will be as happy as myself i	 2.7441721769699865
to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of	 3.7891723262994
would and the argument ended only with the visit	 3.7450245988436164
the communication excited many professions of concern and enough was	 3.063390285121482
lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte	 2.90766315890678
want to think you perfect and you set yourself against it do not be	 2.2218652674676567
in meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one	 3.4059426654281437
having very frequent parties at home these parties were acceptable to	 2.334980896630667
subject of tenderness than of pride his sense of her inferiorityof	 2.9375938416894
kitty for hill i will put on my things in a moment my dear dear	 2.641079867489645
the likeness of mr wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures	 2.962267639872287
but not before they went to brighton	 2.777525211297378
what had happened at netherfield she read with an eagerness which	 2.9588811373949695
attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life he had not	 2.7602942586683357
wedding need not be put off for mr darcy might have done as well	 2.6739840856982324
make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was	 2.8033314379188687
convenience of the world i cannot forget the follies and vices of	 3.386580892865029
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to	 3.575834178762408
apologising for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with	 3.317826347998542
excellent manager i dare say if she is half as sharp as her mother	 2.9803724363722703
younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time	 3.4797860805510514
impatient for display	 3.0257801204401176
silence at length she spoke again i have just had a letter from	 2.5677381823794536
witness of undoubted veracity mr wickham is the son of a very	 3.6062148559461797
original plan	 3.2808226616563876
exceedingly fair lady lucas began directly to calculate with more	 2.871616373534903
had ever known before	 2.903706579183063
insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of	 3.049417173635058
the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that	 2.835123614148152
his being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and certainly	 2.6401593713944247
i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all	 2.2944668384460547
question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner	 4.1602747312110635
was lady catherine books and a billiard table but gentlemen cannot be	 2.9185427807136697
he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his	 3.879597293838166
every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example	 2.3005455784269704
selecting a wife as i certainly did	 2.578701310110415
disagreeable	 3.1011792294501954

of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of	 3.784154417433567

of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy and you yourself when last at	 3.066947040080469
as i might have done but the horror of what might possibly happen	 3.7182770908590808

and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin	 2.745717048593513
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had	 2.467957354487263
affect me either with pleasure or pain i am glad of one thing that he	 2.4356447012071167
questions but answered them very composedlylady catherine then	 2.51211421515575
sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around	 3.6114745354708457
as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage	 2.437158358244989
introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers	 3.8328567052282274
elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning	 3.3690704013442825
that sum	 3.078319288766068
a proper direction	 3.1744448398699587

persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be	 2.8771946281629908
bennet and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous	 4.027507010411914
not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did	 2.6461584087391454
or had you intended any more serious consequence	 2.4315653774900037
but incredulous for mrs bennet with more perseverance than	 3.5740773381923914
could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there	 3.1586324363365765
happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a	 3.2747623880328036
preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my	 2.4786878294752306
behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever	 3.5770394287247975
hopeless of seeing him before but on the third morning after his	 3.256440404009512
one of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to mr	 3.716874551584417
mistakenor at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of	 2.5434909234688887
elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath	 2.9423377126064834
to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last	 3.7954888311205517
elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such	 3.286761613400876

and do you like her	 2.84636521816471
i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy	 3.4193118673583305
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent	 2.5202514861528065
gentlewoman for my sake and for your own let her be an active	 2.582831050516699
sense of the word that he has neither integrity nor honour that he is	 2.700684200931969
well and what news does it bring good or bad	 2.38528199315415
her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of	 3.131317981494292

while mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village	 2.5453983134774143
duplicity in all this but i will endeavour to banish every painful	 3.2750716852548045
pleasure	 3.4289129098105207
felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness	 3.6267287581838845
is above eight months we have not met since the 26th of november when	 3.194575424551102
believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he	 3.3149862090454487
future niece nor could she think without a smile of what her	 2.6473898919171233
finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to	 3.9319894631392267
bingleys regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the	 3.0133775781420016
i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was	 2.6297126659457772
which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time	 2.8328257653035895
her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of	 3.3007512405001522
hertfordshire my dear cousin i flatter myself at least that you will	 2.857488228221561
been to blame i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression	 3.0629442823526984
she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said	 2.9739915644096384
great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly	 3.224192374555278
my dear aunt this is being serious indeed	 2.5441562499410666
of your sisters countenance and air was such as might have given	 2.5964362655571427
mr wickhams charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could	 2.5753740060797625
most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the	 3.7487431920255174
you are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of your	 3.0383963408600847
i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father	 3.2131309196811126
finished her speech of what are you talking	 2.612101242950041
engaged by wickham for those very dancesand to have mr collins	 2.823979597886568
declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the	 2.83264179918032
figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own	 3.0083542703735007
in pompous nothings on his side and civil assents on that of his	 3.3955101772924987
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless mr darcy	 2.4129647158496437
rather thin but however the little theatre was open well and so just	 2.6969250334129717
gained her point and had time to consider of it her reflections were	 2.5417386059571947
friend met her with every appearance of composure elizabeth merely	 2.471029015988872
even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife	 3.5948519124291085
yesif darcy does not put it off again but i am at his disposal he	 2.718033160350233
flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me	 2.563567500494265
myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both	 2.4529770603717753
less interesting mode of attachment be that as it may she saw him go	 2.375757479036731
they talked of his sister his friends his house his fruit of every	 2.971991684473387

she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr	 2.884266302896134
because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party	 2.909492115466284
been the culprit was wretched in the thought of what her sister must	 3.8138887852943686
idle certainly might	 3.0171667807795326
ayebecause she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he	 2.374426302080052
hertfordshire anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes and at	 4.3025419533338995
before her uncle and aunts arrival but they did pass away and mr and	 2.6085866438422967
and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy	 3.8618059240525535
officers of the shire were in general a very creditable	 2.777020275729976
yes there can for mine is totally differentwill you hear it	 3.009410180777659
arrested herand she beheld a striking resemblance of mr darcy with	 5.015663095513287
falsehood	 1.9905095457977273
possible	 3.7661461454724354
assistance would be every thing in the world he will immediately	 2.8732560340989313
but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four	 2.2635596619448517
and it was done for the beston this subject i have nothing more	 3.450533545662982
herself i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the	 2.7017911421878886
least that advantage	 3.14239967643047
generally is jane had been a week in town without either seeing or	 2.468468136919449
convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted	 3.056010231617115
hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a	 3.91069660094821
of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being	 2.5434230910657054
wickham and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr darcys	 3.6310444486812217
but it will have no effect on me	 2.743077532763688
who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and	 2.3162305587759753
in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised	 3.72472829924208
dinner	 3.7890379288859735
hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs bennets civilities	 3.02960092179602
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its	 3.067159943358135
consider what he must have suffered such a disappointment and with the	 3.011882647258971
one into it i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have	 2.9002633510076445
to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do	 3.4844353196879285
sir williams interruption has made me forget what we were talking of	 2.5012930185066247
bingleyand pray what is the result	 3.2531140934398937
regard with any complacency his anxiety for jane was evident and his	 2.433128702788975
disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some	 2.6593282354005554
weight i may suffer from the want of money younger sons cannot marry	 2.5892444836425406
such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice	 3.2706197355796585
this though i doubt whether his reserve or anybodys	 2.760534827464348
good deal the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are	 2.6584798535115306
learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we	 2.7710212870301434
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the	 3.8286370522722835
all lost upon me i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably	 2.4316593578831247
after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words	 2.512007319922899
eight the express was sent off directly my dear lizzy they must	 2.3749169423982845
the other is charlottes marriage it is unaccountable in every view it	 3.103945132322527
her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage	 3.4661069853245867
instituted by the church of england as a clergyman moreover i	 3.5891509666109043

to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be	 2.4908881445686086
elizabeth began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood	 2.4663873640592064
mr darcys letter to lady catherine was in a different style and	 3.0191943705570172
alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness	 2.9494796413818682
darcy after enquiring of her how mr and mrs gardiner did a question	 3.1349016186287297
author jane austen	 3.360486700320961
prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate	 2.8112049500500715
listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre	 2.9061604092459774
it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me your	 2.284040509776553
in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by	 5.0278801508732425
neighbourhood they shall never have admittance i will not encourage	 3.044235396268429
his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said	 3.0709504391060034
that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins	 4.002003176864458
afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly	 3.8168426568066516
with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all	 3.235019200066517
whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable	 4.29710207913264
their engagements at rosings it was some days however before they	 2.5145292850564367
booksoh noi am sure we never read the same or not with the same	 2.406414582633979
their three months acquaintance they had been intimate two	 2.6731427026512504
single	 1.9905095457977273
i often think said she that there is nothing so bad as parting with	 2.7584038603913323
all for janes sake you know and there is no occasion for talking to	 2.8102185311724894
the indirect boastfor you are really proud of your defects in	 3.9578889596080695
mr bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly shewed	 2.3873374989264424
prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her	 2.6093826085181555
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run	 2.841282389056304
unreasonable my brother admires her greatly already he will have	 2.3446080873684934

kindness the day passed most pleasantly away the morning in bustle and	 2.488147806378149

when they ascended the steps to the hall marias alarm was every	 4.67090660711036
pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence	 3.249895784507433
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of	 3.12497743883046
carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their	 2.597133495527973

the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin	 3.163383330870356
though it is charlotte lucas you shall not for the sake of one	 2.7630925170571228
to depreciate such pleasures they would doubtless be congenial with	 3.751064642415967
backgammon mr bennet accepted the challenge observing that he acted	 2.8820172643688764
gentlemen did approach and when mr wickham walked into the room	 2.956113215737041
great not handsome enough to dance with i wish you had been there my	 2.559263377031222
oh yesdo let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be	 3.511785779038479
the latter probableif it be so if i have been misled by such	 3.3302406831369673
despicable	 1.9905095457977273
to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life	 2.8297850391408073
silent till they reached the house their father then went to the	 2.4720258453801196
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and	 2.877385208530705
children of his own and may have more how could he spare half ten	 2.738442698528906
did mr darcy give you his reasons for this interference	 2.8708951781892416
thing and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two	 3.748601784378149
there is not much the matter with me	 2.850233154268851
catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions	 2.649449142826384
at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and	 2.8260066923484164
indeed mama you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her	 3.663031495299653
herself began scolding one of her daughters	 2.781736185714186
which was my chief inducement to enter the shire i knew it to be a	 2.586252151931292
fresh pain i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner	 3.5677979953918366
agreed in wishing for the sake of their sisters feelings and	 2.4659029015812455
preserved	 1.9905095457977273
feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which	 3.653378578566153
good spirits mrs bennet invited him to dine with them but with many	 3.2976118670988024
influenced by my hopes or fearsi did not believe her to be	 2.954729579045626
talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away from	 2.2383588374032923
she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could	 3.8617565406758945
wife may teach him i thought him very slyhe hardly ever	 2.627673955813365
remained with no very cordial feelings towards him she told the story	 2.5051183637085788
i know are all chance in this world there is no knowing how estates	 2.3683743794044148
upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is rather an	 2.092276266580542
mary for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great	 3.6463141463856545
mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast the fishing scheme had been	 2.373359911067927
most delightful placeexcellent parsonage house it would have suited	 2.801976436096338
informed that she was very accomplished	 3.7864815666201754
being in town i am certain from something she said herself and	 2.541647051539836
the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side elizabeth	 2.7808804848491304
yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no	 2.4174275542321593
tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which	 2.8920629236229463
accomplished for her age her performance on the pianoforte is	 3.632554266002453
my dear mr bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of	 2.923669471546085
himself obliged to accept	 3.0845283390116256
nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne	 4.2541343241867775
though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could	 3.3993140679900025
i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise	 2.4361752806297434
dare say very agreeable do let me ask my partner to introduce you	 2.490814807492453
it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began	 2.8013143834176657
having now a good house and very sufficient income he intended to	 3.3881284345334977
them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and	 3.846953006136056
on quitting the militia	 3.2679040491775755
sense of the one before her eyes his belief of her sisters	 2.5027883829232125
for she will not know him herself	 3.070914107165802
family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest	 2.8118520184262867
pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of	 2.339896307610876
certain forgive the questionare you quite certain that you can be	 3.67116849878463
day altogether she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had	 2.591051957552074
electronic works	 3.3002635836096355
though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his	 2.4211599005134445
to get rid of him and unwilling for her sisters sake to provoke him	 3.5746317006933848
them	 3.0861605593407195
you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound you know it is not	 3.540561430861451
better feeling to worldly advantage charlotte the wife of mr collins	 2.561409240139631
themselves the one missent must be first attended to it had been	 2.7159998372063847
material a step without her ladyships concurrence	 2.488547571746373
lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to	 3.4176098092911027
before anybody else however your coming just at this time is the	 2.3776758098807673
purses i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and i am sure i	 2.65458272134996
with the rest of the party she now lost every expectation of pleasure	 2.6234545930178053
instead her liveliness had been never worse timed there was no help	 3.3115477261350295
upon my word said mrs gardiner i begin to be of your uncles	 2.6767727501163425
could have the advantage of a london master she has a very good notion	 2.7228154019426745
that mr collins should be able to procure any womans good opinion	 3.3429173131103904
i am now convinced	 3.0486615212828343
information for them of a different sort much had been done and much	 2.3542612449975855
settled at netherfield as he ought to be lady lucas quieted her fears a	 3.403846899187478
why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she	 2.5343835743012377

chapter ii	 1.9484968389608204
happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in	 2.615673801263738
can never be what we once were to each other	 2.6486251891696675
i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen	 2.7645734566747135
long sleeves	 3.341387888654087
they were all astonished and mr bennet who could by no means wish for	 2.919840956038311
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings	 3.3270219625039457
he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to any	 2.344591652951447
on his account and my nieces it is mr wickhams intention to go	 2.3430712346146714
how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode our plain	 2.899709613844009
home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor mr	 2.964371444505062
she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy by the	 2.7553822497250717
campful of soldiers to us who have been overset already by one poor	 3.06758148078634
high importance received her with the utmost politeness after sitting	 2.9589285272274624
persuaded would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this	 2.380793323887667
with them many instructions on execution and taste elizabeth received	 2.9232113256909726
discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he	 2.6026819565379866
daughter let us come to a right understanding into one house in this	 2.227120325441054
i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now	 3.531609341455407
for my attentions to you last spring is nothing due to me on that	 2.6908184746958916
oh she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld but there is one	 2.730645907575668
chapter xiii	 1.9484968389608204
has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due	 2.7437753462121095
affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence	 2.2486459341571887
of which prudence forbad the disclosure she dared not relate the other	 3.6706481942701084
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal mr darcys	 2.681509846087875
look on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when	 3.524376193632968
bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield	 2.612827708558539
unpardonable in me	 3.0041222537696837
himself to produce a more valuable soninlaw	 3.588433098100912
there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment	 2.5999711646229344
letter i wish this may be more intelligible but though not	 2.9503098178878138
writing i would not give up mr collinss correspondence for any	 3.133919532621002
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it	 2.7307379872171134
situation hastily exclaimed i beg your pardon but i must leave you	 2.905928457357742
that is not very likely our authority was too good	 2.6303295175207144
mr wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the	 2.176925462961951
yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot come	 2.0870887338979096
as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth warmlyi have spent	 2.7620266470930783
she soon afterwards said	 2.956846219191355
their mother mr collinss letter had done away much of her illwill	 2.5580217999637935
the matter as you do now	 3.0018453322266905
equal	 3.838376149300958
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish	 3.788245974277866
express that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer you	 2.534277335658083
such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen	 2.9828364859991447
her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been	 2.600994634238797
brotherinlaw of wickham every kind of pride must revolt from the	 2.5164301147376547
daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this	 2.4645789546808308
conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the	 2.7650269620595256
true you are a gentlemans daughter but who was your mother who	 2.6112242321366197
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal	 4.248911514301728
neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he	 2.5566257108806476
the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have	 2.312313187712773
living in his gift he was my godfather and excessively attached to me	 4.042911425400012
jane then took it from her pocketbook and gave it to elizabeth these	 2.872768048814344
child and now heres mr bennet gone away and i know he will fight	 2.730650449494282

acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest	 2.5579481524561376
a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but	 3.408277882986396
be greater than at home he heard her attentively and then said	 3.1041692984692664
i had not thought mr darcy so bad as thisthough i have never liked	 3.02907369874244
all your sorrow and disgrace let me advise you then my dear sir	 3.7112640702027595

fullpursuing her way along the lane she then began it it was dated	 3.521451614603077
room	 3.7910174397359944
i admire all my three sonsinlaw highly said he wickham perhaps	 2.210118203267549
you liked her i hope she will turn out well	 2.297191085317717
elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said	 3.8371236713505614
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to	 4.110713551164287
great perseverance yet time and her aunt moved slowlyand her patience	 2.900650722370798

she asked the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so pen	 2.7893651390809926
jane on their first arrival at lambton and this disappointment had	 2.770984620928789
safe for herthat she was not enough recovered but jane was firm where	 3.4668077629911607
aunt so well that i am not afraid of requesting it though i have	 3.208425867534505
ah cried mrs bennet shaking her head then she is better off than	 2.4843692819080414
accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without	 3.1318958870004456
fortnight not one party or scheme or any thing to be sure london was	 2.642808002813716
elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend he	 3.1864282885274844
with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr wickham and the	 3.263979214642118
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would	 3.0807092385822084
they returned down stairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were	 2.3797914387351113

chapter iv	 1.9484968389608204
assure you it is much larger than sir william lucass	 2.7717766937011916
you are joking lizzy this cannot beengaged to mr darcy no no	 3.0580819422512078
that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion when mr	 2.8242694191536226
ignorant i must be more explicit on the very day of my coming	 3.3060265417357875
connections i never heard of her existence till the day before	 3.667163838074664
he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each	 3.587268718099598
you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner	 2.4633239291866027
spirits by all that affection could do	 2.730377228304183
people here abouts know i am married today i was afraid they might	 2.565410055095151
it was a journey of only twentyfour miles and they began it so early	 2.3589260877503744
well then you need not be under any alarm i will take care of	 2.57457389323517
other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone	 3.072260367021577
not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner	 2.8508039436889816
lizzy said her father i have given him my consent he is the kind	 2.765107334846869
cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement when hearing	 3.4332205097495545
london and had she been able to receive them into her house they	 2.727436526739072
various recollections connected with him gave her a moments distress	 2.6774345345390853

talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying	 2.8037815770510224
features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself	 2.909389266383135
the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of	 2.6029378050888403
her being hereafter our sister i do not know whether i ever before	 2.706650550869945
elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards	 3.123217982304842
yourself	 3.853564428928797
tis too much she added by far too much i do not deserve it oh	 3.0157527206793264
bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and mr bennet spent the	 4.264941509987219
returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given	 2.430658100936212
can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good	 2.2329679848910895
at last to gosaying as she quitted the room if any young men come	 3.3437585468651623

either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from	 2.7697197761081456
she is so fond of mrs forster said she it will be quite shocking	 2.7618975355895308

the road with some abruptness wound it was a large handsome stone	 4.2018310825289715

in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy she follows him to	 3.7070455138699305
mr bingleys will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must	 2.3610218281975843
happiness jane had been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own	 4.867612052507057
towards discharging their bills their manner of living even when the	 2.940593381375244
wonder nor condemn but the belief of his selfconquest brought nothing	 3.482436522845117
wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were	 3.0776645933973596
doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much	 2.7879674223405426
much but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no	 2.3930554666179824
wait for any opening of yours my aunts intelligence had given me	 2.2692008508894927
knowledge of your ill opinion too and having to relate such a thing of	 2.3748932079514753
longbourn before she told her sister of mr darcys proposals to know	 2.909723654152935
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and	 2.8259457315291967
of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirms	 2.6829523943153646
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly	 2.8027957045890814
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during	 3.3803089903815224
before the carriage stopped at longbourn house	 3.364748437233453
the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her	 2.214820243812588
and half the night spent in conversation	 2.4954817891342023
only headstrong in such matters as these in every thing else she is as	 2.817833732983725
guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his	 3.039468675759706
stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes	 3.6987946071273328
what i told you on that point when first we talked of it	 2.4932623372474993
violence of my affection to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and	 2.5985312964134595
connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling but we are none	 2.980574886400087

abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin	 3.4818598888675503
in contempt for it she was received however very politely by them	 2.3456631720651133
quite as their own i dare say whenever that happens	 2.8631116534946517
in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with her	 2.60780704069156
headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to	 2.469142139887483
disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last	 3.7868046871138783
our habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in	 3.3879938140789934
friendly and obliging it was mr collinss picture of hunsford and	 2.930410261369115
hypocrisy of my soninlaw and pray lizzy what said lady catherine	 2.7869003191346127
case here mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income but not	 2.710275899958958
notice but he certainly has not known her long	 2.547964053292466
he chose fordyces sermons lydia gaped as he opened the volume and	 3.0881243502537234
nay if you are so serious about it i shall consider the matter as	 2.753432344177205
elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though	 2.58675236626888
soon as she could to the girls who could not listen to their cousin	 2.821544862045761
i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some	 2.936824593069375
elder sisters she said to elizabeth	 2.6000254789132367
very gravelybut i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all	 2.9474048504756714
i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had	 2.924181912098491
with him i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance	 2.8846858580119914
certainly he replied biting his lips elizabeth hoped she had	 3.08902956889053
his commission so much the better it will save me a world of trouble	 2.853745017515269
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw	 2.43719756481441
disappointments abroad	 2.20683721812523
from the drawingroom they could distinguish nothing in the lane and	 3.136554614485206
continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown	 2.5383657559268746
wishes for your health and happiness	 2.8481558690297235
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over	 3.0988784343122164
being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend	 2.8906735132801393
with an air of distant civility mr collins however was not	 2.3437015066095563
your situation with much compassion	 2.649532187535954
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects but when they see	 3.0815335299573654
himselffrom whom she had previously received the information of his	 3.0261321647395922
sure will not hear of her removal	 3.104713356655741
surprised very much surprisedso lately as mr collins was wishing to	 3.704845240722595
never sir	 3.3644835383999845
shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well	 2.833929323615684
my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts let us hope for	 2.4207995370330337
calling yesterday to thank me she finds miss pope a treasure lady	 2.9037541896869685
herself	 3.3993167986194908
was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were	 2.7631229825594747
wickham immediately to elizabeths mind and from the observation of the	 2.6537190401512447
great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen	 2.719401113601158
and doubt as to the occasions justifying her coming so far alone the	 3.712921148416798
make such an awkward business of it did you see it	 3.0301495583910265
he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia	 2.363751618431142
whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general	 3.547778822433356
not do justice to his own disposition you have shewn him off now much	 2.7354407077833898
poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the	 3.3703617263890577
to do	 3.388633144963703
marriage would scarcely seem valid exceeded all that she could believe	 3.255640261185797
on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her	 2.6432803387394133
countenance elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first	 2.7435744188146343
resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left	 2.9327983886202253
done about pemberley cried mrs gardiner john told us mr darcy was	 2.5174793002807596
enough from my thoughts	 2.8555371248077743
but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident	 2.3917531852512384
girls in his life every body had been most kind and attentive to him	 3.126668090421444
when is your next ball to be lizzy	 2.5185595878912506
mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley he	 3.384098223944785
good god what is the matter cried he with more feeling than	 2.5315883641485675
heavy looking young man of five and twenty his air was grave and	 2.644227351836274
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance	 3.2761270831820104
with hermiss darcy the daughter of mr darcy of pemberley and lady	 2.635768668014385
settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity	 2.4129833123552347
venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually	 4.412854204104601
or cause to occur a distribution of this or any project gutenbergtm	 3.557396683456956
that you should come together oh he is the handsomest young man that	 2.9361207376736482
businessdo clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of	 2.869320970121305
divide with me i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy	 3.8086373801977866
she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets	 3.2273048087080882
too much truth the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no	 2.3057334343334723
and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement	 2.3771945422224188
may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as	 3.195153613111615
let me know every thing that i am to know without delay will you tell	 2.7837997340919833
they agreed that mrs bennet should only hear of the departure of the	 2.8453022446438645
mrs gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked	 2.529732197122866
tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in	 2.46651972315321
turn about the roomi assure you it is very refreshing after sitting	 3.1478028055698823
the lakes and still thought there might have been time enough but it	 2.864706010092148
property of some one or other of their daughters	 2.6564529422064087
or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that	 2.6201376836260106
female character	 3.322343816840791
to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows	 2.4518334658537473
to maintain you when your father is deadi shall not be able to keep	 2.9224180137361198
exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i	 2.9668131796174
friend you see by janes account was persuaded of his never intending	 2.2671152414046154
much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing	 2.6359623709272295
accusations were illfounded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour	 2.5863344348804023
it is not quite a week since they left brighton in a few days more we	 2.549257356241038
defects such as but not limited to incomplete inaccurate or	 3.908657314244537
superscripted characters are enclosed by curly brackets	 3.8737359212880724
she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and	 2.7333779672559837
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcy	 3.359637919747886
see that your reproofs had been attended to how soon any other wishes	 2.741012169384753
honourable and ancient though untitled families their fortune on both	 2.951716348683221
perceive that her spirits were affected by it they were more disturbed	 2.7082348335763378
exceed their income my dear mr bennet cried his wife what are you	 3.1805717381559164
her own uncle if he had not had a family of his own i and my children	 2.7310876810223603
again over the perverseness of the meeting and his behaviour so	 3.4225078741243853
of the surrounding families that he is considered as the rightful	 4.149846693135681
has very much at heart	 2.7756803136420416
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did	 2.4230446421341485
mr darcy repeated elizabeth in utter amazement	 2.8966813105862173
by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by	 3.1431103694899223
millars regiment went away i thought i should have broke my heart	 2.925553452678925
decided your character was unfolded in the recital which i received	 4.014345501393138
to oakham mount this morning it is a nice long walk and mr darcy has	 3.6939294275601036
it elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed	 4.037871545017817
we were all dancing together at netherfield	 2.540027606100094
it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should	 2.579658418997713
but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely	 2.5598800035657705
declared that they were miserable they solaced their wretchedness	 3.8469937597538855
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself	 2.241521533749014
affection every moment more valuable	 2.8556792665119732
standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and	 3.3281286200481337
elizabeth smiled	 3.3047137965725257
nothing	 3.3935277111111577
this account then is what he has received from mr darcy i am	 2.577259782004326
heard you utter good girl it would vex me indeed to see you again	 2.780503862245825
same lydias going to brighton was all that consoled her for the	 2.865316519680244
to assist mr wickham with money	 3.157246493251013
elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the	 2.337365563737217
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs bennet got	 2.543931154918144
and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently there has	 3.1543579801077177
i am talking of possibilities charles	 2.924324394380768
himself	 3.387487101882539
to be so very accomplished as they all are	 3.7706675598831962
he readily agreed to it	 2.853939417271024
all i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it	 2.772234239495943
oh thensome time or other we shall be happy to hear you our	 2.5427104132345355
will not take comfort in mine believe her to be deceived by all means	 2.516285036302107
that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as	 2.4799035783831993
poor lydia an express came at twelve last night just as we were	 2.3026746441137953
happy i am sure i shant get a wink of sleep all night i knew how it	 3.410401055834021
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of	 2.9809464912223986
you have a very small park here returned lady catherine after a short	 2.3647395516402874
elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her	 3.7416366334513596
whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins was convinced that	 3.3632123309885613
despair i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in	 3.0778320339849063
appearance before one came from her books and the other from her	 3.104804434125039
has she been presented i do not remember her name among the ladies at	 2.637047506683071
agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be	 3.1191309606688513
promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument he	 3.182732610619734
it was two or three days before he could get from her what he	 2.459055094587324
to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was	 2.665381874281639
the loss of her daughter made mrs bennet very dull for several days	 2.6392610648693364
scarcely less eager to meet her again i really do not think georgiana	 2.6555886703718334
the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its	 2.9495150219259143
immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour but	 2.718808989736913
lizzy my dear i want to speak with you	 3.3006807930736817
character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these	 2.9273386495003666
to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three	 2.527716913869111
long as it is possiblei know it cannot be long	 3.458470559909822
chapter v	 1.9484968389608204
that all was safe her wit flowed long	 3.5860585787538066
five grown up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own	 2.3442753894921324
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes to	 3.2862212315564814
unhappy there may be error and there may be misery thoughtlessness	 3.488660098684948
think of nothing but of mr wickham and of what he had told her all	 3.221061021512712
exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he	 2.9775036669478103
chapter vii	 1.9484968389608204
is less certain	 3.0722263904984763
for your sakes we would do any thing lydia my love though you are	 2.505082126665431
though we know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she	 2.4382344118656687
their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing	 3.020223233179319
hanging woods to the edge of the water in one of its narrowest parts	 3.8263907780683897
entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the	 2.887629314877738
appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation	 2.5383897865356277
now kitty you may cough as much as you chuse said mr bennet and	 2.937353762650364
particularly acquainted with my partner at such an assembly as this it	 2.9688519661576223
were received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be	 2.906272043393817
forget because they were not immediately before methese causes	 3.0622068224858268
he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his	 2.878171323771988
discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss	 3.7984137269256637
the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made	 2.2796683174684693
happiness	 3.744345479795769
may convince you of its being one	 3.3588487907881053
as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to	 3.2732120535424856
lizzy you must not do so you must not suspect me it mortifies me i	 3.4078197246886694
there is also one other person in the party he continued after a	 2.29908485680785
their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly	 2.7217631280725216
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord	 5.135643724599119
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the	 2.6906543855925857
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe how can you be smiling so	 3.6901745625625444
lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her	 3.2517118726035235
quick in its execution he begged to know farther particulars of what he	 3.5402218932435594
himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions	 3.648823360816063
generally known because if it were to get round to the ladys family	 2.990818327483449
owe you you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most	 2.8901115290786388
those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the	 3.86327279722493
of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made every thing worse	 2.4883754552625343
my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your	 3.0919712157530865
hours of separation that must sometimes occur in the absence of jane	 3.740311320739559
intimidate me	 3.2261397078424863
kitty did she very innocently said what is the matter mamma what do	 2.7296085593181254
occasion of dictating to others in the intervals of her discourse with	 4.307393453086251
do you suppose them to be in london	 3.13331364956373
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the	 3.060538001261401
feeling i am sure you did the turn of your countenance i shall never	 2.776451137348041
on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing	 2.686927917617401
about them that he advanced but little whilst wandering on in this	 3.7256014151538044
lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingleys	 2.638328467305259
may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public	 3.8671431139383805
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that	 2.7677752668479907
asked in the course of the evening elizabeth reserved to herself the	 3.136815179159678
you till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your	 2.6815834970084196
between them and if she might judge from his complexion his mind was	 3.0730985817058514
left them capable of considering the last half hour with some	 2.3455626219197105
was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and	 3.2146302020501034
wish he had danced with eliza	 2.698286880831055
these are home questionsand perhaps i cannot say that i have	 2.812852108664121
smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things	 2.3959317514090555
they walked on without knowing in what direction there was too much to	 3.0544683431713042
as to a real strong attachment pray how violent was mr bingleys	 2.345865646366675
do for us we do not suffer by accident it does not often happen	 2.5344569741015017
trouble of practising it is not that i do not believe my fingers as	 4.046980884178355
i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time i	 3.023576595226835
him it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we	 3.107530247655985
will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of	 2.9608293641352508
laid the foundation it is too long ago i was in the middle before i	 3.3035116513966916
nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable kitty and	 2.8227385915614445
all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt that	 2.970274612100623
who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the	 2.555215182330588
the idea she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her	 2.672867090590365
will last and what sort of table do they keep charlotte is an	 2.302042826779488
introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had	 2.8200946565508245
he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped to interrupt	 3.810935637886083
of seeing you at pemberley today	 3.0212681166720943
was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting both changed colour	 2.45417708937973

for the liveliness of your mind i did	 3.4326019262775183
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here	 4.466314320829491
so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear that	 2.746472252968656

something else	 3.4190291332577143
this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of	 2.645265534443701
and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own	 2.949810938655799
estate whenever it falls without any selfreproach this matter may be	 2.591025544279478

mrs bennets schemes for this day were ineffectual bingley was every	 2.8433412169773473

sister they are all for what they can get i am sorry to say it of	 2.501972352542241

none at all we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but	 2.9175914570775494
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning	 4.0834721263694975
offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i	 2.4124965932610696

it is well you refuse then to oblige me you refuse to obey the	 3.2399192855290293
she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty mrs hurst	 2.486352288793462
other had ever seen him bingley of course returned with him to dinner	 2.4183377138595863
myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that	 2.5176779978898747
feels the loss of friends so much as i do but i am particularly	 3.472009480023651
wants you in the library she was gone directly	 2.804311978893972
the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger mrs	 2.5455355164116447
taken to separate mr bingley and jane she had never doubted but she	 3.83810152777792
conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her	 2.8338386418434283
her daughter and mrs jenkinson were sittingher ladyship with great	 3.1195869956047195
and we mean to treat you all added lydia but you must lend us the	 3.189219186490576
receive the last finish i believe i have now told you every thing	 2.9324366962654764
regiment after such an affront to colonel forster his temptation is	 3.264741465010022
her judgment controverted she enquired into charlottes domestic	 3.0750501288436114
from the shire as clearly as mr gardiner could do but mrs	 2.8300780666852643
herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the	 2.4348581455626785
no that i am sure i shall not and i think it was very impertinent of	 3.685464518408516
but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only mr	 2.3849845913197587
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings partyi assure	 3.343744323188783
a most unexpected and serious nature but i am afraid of alarming	 3.379941529342735
manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we	 2.823523318895133
she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means there were	 2.601316374771878
of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as	 2.879315522786594
to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in	 2.3968014587176225
short pause followed this speech and mrs hurst began again	 2.4419062991456633
and what arts did he use to separate them	 2.8759335783925732
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first	 2.990281765535975
well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what	 2.680549713327381
oh lord yesthere is nothing in that i shall like it of all	 2.82006034756118
pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her	 2.893396602875022
particulars immediately following of wickhams resigning all pretensions	 2.776285583099997
his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as shewed an	 2.914764728436886
forward to as possible at some future time	 2.548140986305898
in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the	 2.8266979125405567
attention his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling	 2.962175151375367
old housekeeper i suppose poor reynolds she was always very fond of	 2.7106873372507816
and economy had it been your uncles doing i must and would have	 2.466091995727763
endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and	 3.0463853437180344
should think highly of himself if i may so express it he has a right	 2.3584625073904752
fixed for the following tuesday the two ladies were delighted to see	 2.571283384156868
place and a camp upon the whole therefore she found what has been	 2.8534433229365948
lovely and amiable when darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley	 3.368440096897448
mother went forward to meet her but instead of the expected summons	 2.371572556948774
elizabeths misery increased at such unnecessary such officious	 2.763364878125286
kitty owned that she had rather stay at home darcy professed a great	 3.292475509238322
last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry	 2.7787379930407075
flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be	 2.4811337702117386
father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they	 2.4523645705976787
tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton i owe all that i know	 3.0539263869771167
while she staid with us if i had not perceived by janes letter	 3.0822312792611952
i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us it was more	 2.5856678073050676
she practises very constantly	 3.1642562406215355
application was a something to look forward to	 2.6267676069141332
place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been	 2.464302218953189
intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to	 3.0460895382317124
charge for the ebooks unless you receive specific permission if you	 2.903463034883292
pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he	 2.7861716207035916
when he has nothing to do	 2.999170293722641
time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings and it was now heightened	 4.901180919553761
be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt	 2.6217340007768355
and i have another favour to ask will you come and see me	 2.4428739358090352
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification she went on	 4.6761803708083844
you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to	 2.3826535392450756
immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could	 2.269949247590169
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the	 4.191830937776019
visited them all and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity	 3.1305629688653944
good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said	 2.643896264497127
jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and	 2.719761305477037
have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn	 3.726222697314647
had yet learnt to care for at a ball they returned therefore in good	 2.246604522935631
way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and	 3.540926577527325
replied that he was adding but we expect him tomorrow with a	 3.375371743039948
could i expect it to be otherwise said she yet why did he come	 2.614109405270292
passed took leave and rode on with his friend	 2.934490296865197
cannot afford it and what claims has lydia what attractions has she	 2.9076409398825387
go too of all things only think what a miserable summer else we shall	 2.432255549614003
speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrs	 2.8974766419015165
gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn	 2.528606375158257
he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have	 3.203754717766705
what i think	 3.418809587268235
it must have been his sisters doing they were certainly no friends to	 2.381022801150785
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane	 3.2417209645266962
and taking her hand he would have given it to mr darcy who though	 3.113370250121204
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design these	 2.3289597409361997
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity	 2.8052777955537556
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing	 3.622983111333298
oh my dear mr bennet as she entered the room we have had a most	 2.8401148803189877
more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner mr	 2.3012685916389453
mrs philips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest from	 2.909925617553266
opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me that she could	 3.1698067831395966
power of reading again i can remember some expressions which might	 2.33049210394958
on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shewn into a very	 3.8686817110145815
youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming	 2.4742783553019914
perhaps i am not doing her justice but she is very young she has never	 2.7473737183288836
and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible the comfort to her	 2.397456783255767
thought he must be sensible himself it was a subject in short on	 2.8668486453077415
but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another	 2.7781614564114
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a	 2.8833790808796316
dinner was on table they left her to vent all her feelings on the	 2.9739293386218093
approach and before she could strike into another path she was	 3.149246403740421
know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we were beyond	 2.53938815056698
no she would go home i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies for	 3.05638545935025
sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane	 2.47826771428233
visitor did at last appear but the shortness of her stay and yet more	 3.1846405996214595
but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult	 2.334675757760941
yes very well i saw them the night before last	 2.4619160170430128
she accordingly read and elizabeth who knew what curiosities his	 2.6377863681731997
you did and it was not wholly without foundation you may remember	 2.8418670930044048
looks	 3.8433145496393974
a way	 3.4488373257399365
which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned her eye on	 3.349730340488949
yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly oh jane	 2.6720887134019193
wonder elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the	 2.305616722332399
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them any thing was a	 2.553634736313728
taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the	 3.6619033446798976
oh yesthat that is the worst of all till i was in kent and saw	 3.568325658432062
would mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention	 3.3412267521787204
done for your long kind satisfactory detail of particulars but	 3.029401802720209
here again i shall give you painto what degree you only can tell	 2.3921294591489026
equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your	 2.677780210937037
the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all	 3.0094033613667728
it is your turn to say something now mr darcyi talked about	 2.3600446649042492
we never had any governess	 3.304110303845004
quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the	 4.121484629568129

his while among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a	 2.832844836089766
bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield	 3.2144000549234795
it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been things	 2.492174309940537
when the party broke up lydia returned with mrs forster to meryton	 2.3493150092774675
which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room and	 3.2977345295196065
what should not you mind	 2.9289342895102903
altogether mr bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and	 2.456230916986446
elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to	 2.145943655876246
violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it	 2.688044903075504
after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr wickham	 2.6660814379869824
jane i hope and trust they will yet be happy his consenting to marry	 2.6407186280240493
having too much or too little light a great deal more passed at the	 2.44353052173012
which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailing she	 3.4588250724125253
carter do not go so often to miss watsons as they did when they first	 2.6160495246011335

thing declared they were arriving mr collins and charlotte appeared at	 3.249035736972645
morning if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here again with	 2.473986229182393

he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its	 3.5731265902563956
enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford she	 2.685322742425171

quadrille in the evening lady catherine was reckoned proud by many	 3.0701403462818337

was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied	 3.6281844712704796
falsehood he has imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to	 2.694787472574457
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to	 2.643154487271098
ten thousand pounds heaven forbid how is half such a sum to be	 3.2751426804573134

after receiving his explanatory letter both sisters were uncomfortable	 2.534470557482949
but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said jane	 2.7342801122896168

perhaps i do arguments are too much like disputes if you and miss	 2.768639186675018

my dear brother	 3.218907099854956
removing all my doubts i am not indebted for my present happiness to	 3.68429404393743

on either side that spoke particular regard nothing occurred between	 2.3555359115698487
my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these they will	 2.263711999002285

what did you say of me that i did not deserve for though your	 3.460400462173313
now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting	 3.2273643096619176
but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that	 3.210686957363308

elizabeth you are not serious now	 3.1790546691554815
why does she not come in	 2.826510525170216
his partners oh that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance	 4.247315424125867
verdure of the early trees she was on the point of continuing her walk	 3.549022032411317
certain absolutely certain	 3.1033015301520868
mr gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their	 2.330521464306308
for being so silly	 3.1182345802336635
can have induced him to behave so cruelly	 4.377121043627708
had you then persuaded yourself that i should	 2.7132654295343994
every thing how i long to see her and to see dear wickham too but the	 2.378271929716002
wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the	 2.344336841130868
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though	 3.0261568893430453
should meet	 3.4199175596228386

satisfaction as sistersmr bingley will not be detained in london by	 3.3126300357169924
invitation	 3.8860822224513707
safe arrival in london and when she wrote again elizabeth hoped it	 2.630742305396949
her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present	 2.9674362692370835
georgiana that morning no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely	 2.2517088912711274
very unexpectedfor your housekeeper she added informed us that	 2.5565491141180816
colonel fitzwilliams manners were very much admired at the parsonage	 3.446875445201002
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to	 2.638186711650674
credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more	 4.046534410347263
then who taught you who attended to you without a governess you must	 2.7270732579997223
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself since her	 3.0506739550138926
compliment must be all for herself her astonishment however was	 2.453378335111461
assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of	 2.609011084078019
faults at different times but this is the true one nothing was	 2.472503790559929
steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and	 2.3727233865744966
jane i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get	 2.622896673621191
integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of mr	 4.059322567299095
will believe me the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent	 2.8870975282974833
more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to	 3.3148268657293483
nothing he may not like to hear	 2.9905187567278775
beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point	 2.6822024186863493

of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and	 3.3164445422574684
of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of	 3.1608220456993505
dependence when have you been prevented by want of money from going	 2.33164054019551
sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips	 3.101214597009939
it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had	 2.981116182844591
spoken so sensibly and observed in a halfwhisper to lady lucas that	 3.82763686878523
not to hear in a doleful voice mrs bennet thus began the projected	 2.904659517704451
while you have been here	 3.5698243106707097
expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect	 2.970627768382764
it is more than i engage for i assure you	 3.2484780710093184
did he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant and since this sad	 3.5527745035484832
she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited	 3.701921072089975
oh no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so	 2.1635249723933683
she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found	 2.738256835527179
little time thereforei shall certainly try to get the better	 2.4738720231521585

she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over	 3.4181183582763524
impossible not to long to know	 2.8327414752876194
world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away	 2.3014768367343814
this was a lucky idea of mine indeed said mrs bennet more than	 2.756496861195864
nothing child nothing i did not wink at you she then sat still five	 2.701402472534965
exceedingly bad he had found the law a most unprofitable study	 2.695346806581473
to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and	 3.1975700949331687
been forming a new acquaintance	 3.0260876984528533
one of the gates into the ground	 3.567522678837555
conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will	 2.6984476824019645
a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would	 3.599282777851527
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered miss	 2.7369426573524556
character connections and situation in life i am convinced that my	 2.6557657875259024
many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest	 3.191013492031022
place	 3.825157216798554
and wish him all manner of evil but my feelings are not only cordial	 2.2377227650893183
moreover caught his fancy very much he now seated himself by her and	 2.5995008679151432
from their aunt at present indeed they were well supplied both with	 2.2809602455314537
elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books	 2.504777843263701
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated	 2.581659704545754
assurances of speedy payment for which i have pledged myself and	 3.8495285494809344
amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no	 3.0292541863929143
yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine	 2.766432492927811
you must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon mature	 2.683012816083561
girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is	 2.7866772440874277

asked her for the two next then the two third he danced with miss	 2.729432245755321

or five thousand a year what a fine thing for our girls	 2.4731670225563698
particularly hurts me i will have no reserves from you mr darcy	 3.1987007655815396
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most	 2.871300637189521

a day or two since we first cameand yet how many things have	 2.234924892888368
of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself he was a tall	 3.675924911680493
should now escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope of	 2.917761553222095
i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a	 2.5671624149155137
sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a	 4.044429028868626
more agitated voice that i might have prevented iti who knew	 2.6622065745693058
i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if	 2.1959326057831143
but before they heard again from mr gardiner a letter arrived for	 2.289126431714947
dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house	 2.8427106588338367
by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she	 3.252750326368988
with a stronger voice she soon added i have this comfort immediately	 2.619065858454522
another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to	 4.076662717497681
a creature as ever livedand her nieces are very pretty behaved girls	 2.388825009059547
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful	 2.7005804793527313

this young man will influence her we live in so different a part of	 2.283713372119907
indeed i had what will you think of my vanity i believed you to be	 2.4702153396651454
signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however	 2.7597037356160428
what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation cried he do	 2.905575101269884
exquisite	 1.9905095457977273
will see a finer larger picture of him than this this room was my late	 2.7442989940469613
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed he was received by mrs	 2.7832162599253887

moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the	 2.9394934565742967
she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to	 3.4023707473305986
dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away	 2.4289947760277326
quarrel about the past in future i hope we shall be always of one	 3.1697235804256443
pens remarkably well	 3.0762801322341864
minutes in which they continued together were some of the most	 2.921737092932575
astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of	 2.3401694582080452
elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking	 2.665910372725171
trademark owner and any distributor under this agreement will not be	 3.1302996743156184
humoured girl but as emptyheaded as himself had nothing to say that	 3.1030859912468203
that i may have it tomorrow	 2.853882989342963
jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to	 2.9832565487855467
then turning to mr bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at	 3.047549009388096
by introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she	 3.7184101299496173
you may be sure of my pardon	 2.7084002482604315
to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she	 3.2576325567957505
mr darcys letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart she	 2.4200282827426314
want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel	 3.1244692382379133
missing him she really rejoiced at it colonel fitzwilliam was no	 2.5280340150615133
unassuming and gentle elizabeth who had expected to find in her as	 2.7169169466703194
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt	 3.9902156780313205
remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself	 3.543689538593232
was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to	 3.1180282278534373
fun herewhat do you think has happened this morningmr collins has	 2.668450678740491
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up	 3.0431641076828417
forgotten there was really a great air of comfort throughout and by	 2.3168533808865885
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity mr collinss present	 4.224352550649975
1813	 1.9905095457977273
maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern	 2.4221822694551176
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcys marriage but as she	 3.6018963009091207
some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course	 4.4869579360901195
over it immediately it had better have happened to you lizzy you	 2.4315228274199776
if elizabeth when mr darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to	 2.608329888787785
onesbut now we may be silent	 2.7332718485078678
world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of any body i only	 2.66171784810089
in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh	 3.302327798778498
twelvemonth happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance if	 2.330709365899706
were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his	 2.570519342508511
friend how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so	 2.32277344431351
i have an excessive regard for jane bennet she is really a very sweet	 2.4043676774972025
language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time	 2.7790886799698904
she was engaged one day as she walked in reperusing janes last	 2.419281802778161
me to unfold to any human being having said thus much i feel no	 2.9439657627351012
reverse there is a mixture of servility and selfimportance in his	 4.494415607259027
welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to	 2.489326764795826
of fingering though her taste is not equal to annes anne would have	 3.16397490445738
wickham he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and	 2.89831939734949
hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology	 3.660927698514955
marrying him	 3.3445518031606536
even elizabeth began to fearnot that bingley was indifferentbut that	 3.5541440593410707
all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must yet	 2.576028928019677
to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certain true he	 3.2301011818716368
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for his	 2.7641562599543215
remembered to you and her motheryours c	 3.1958197936374084

section 2 information about the mission of project gutenbergtm	 3.4123319482781325
nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of	 3.091104973493053
she could not think of darcys leaving kent without remembering that	 2.8562107468041757
the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly on	 3.0159220187449964
perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to	 3.149569175477299
illtreatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite	 3.051051496169648
say voluntarily to elizabeth	 3.43464953677517
another intreaty that she would be serious however produced the	 3.0404927277973695
school and an establishment formed for her in london and last	 2.5350586765049474
may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth	 2.207814512176914
similarity in the turn of our mindswe are each of an unsocial	 2.871099824531702
mrs bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some	 2.563984419792583
and luckily for the others the business of lovemaking relieved them	 4.079424275408007

solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and every thing	 3.2181578755459648
as the rattle of the chaise elizabeth loved absurdities but she had	 4.204495472082599
particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of	 3.001193347953632
collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of	 2.4675313301443222
back her ladyship was highly incensed	 2.937735753772755
my dear harriet	 3.2495008096362836

likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken	 3.697250849743813
unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined she respected she	 3.35315309822544
undoubtedly did you see him while you were at lambton i thought i	 2.886610641356616
commission in the shire she had been watching him the last hour	 3.344251384185201
were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture	 3.274768137515785
fighting tell him what a dreadful state i am inthat i am frightened	 3.0135062933086867
materially affected by the difference her sisters situation remained	 3.1925796354266467
i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have	 3.1817989569094904
perfectly soi thank you	 2.9456524612205643
one looked white the other red mr wickham after a few moments	 3.385537294686063
victory over him continued her triumph	 2.887004089717789
family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your	 3.079415398343206
i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship you	 3.215207038525249
what is it you mean	 3.0511657095799873
acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect	 2.932814490350146
education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend	 3.0891410795140377
power to dance with others in vain did she entreat him to stand up with	 3.427192556539104
dear lizzy pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before i	 2.5750817156077166
required of you is to assure to your daughter by settlement her	 2.489932743067232
she is saving enough there is nothing extravagant in their	 3.1697222388657353
to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together after	 3.030226621188178
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined with amazement did	 3.330254804217457
handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks	 3.3563059117762046
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as	 3.4576593523411328
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she	 2.6092382258855946
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that	 2.530868377163733
wickham and herself jane listened with astonishment and concernshe	 2.55162492865418
probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak	 3.3201004151916966
not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her	 3.8490588823067973
family how shall i bear so much happiness	 2.458197256732848

impression on them elizabeth would not observe her and when at last	 3.3398847942752448
my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request	 2.254173524129199
they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself	 2.9803805098636693
kind of supposition which had appeased mrs bennets curiosity and	 3.1894101140906503
a wife in view as he meant to chuse one of the daughters if he found	 2.4779521280161974
forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful	 2.9922555204233174
revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering	 3.758545278355762
encouragement in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew more	 3.0274526743272165

are not your own	 2.986085990675279
him too little to care for his approbation	 2.9538435430740884
a point should admit of doubt but really i know not what to say	 2.673733270770048
have you any other objection said elizabeth than your belief of my	 2.241572867723454
must deaden them more mr darcys behaviour astonished and vexed her	 2.638546474523587
the generality of female minds but i confess they would have no charms	 3.857374743656874
but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfathers	 2.4701330912077877
ambition will ever be gratified i came to try you i hoped to find you	 2.2940860743922
indeed cried wickham with a look which did not escape her and pray	 3.0662817522187793
i hope you will consent to be of the party indeed eliza you will be	 2.8662523795320634
doubted and was silent this he considered sufficient encouragement	 2.553251710271737
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three months	 3.51696928653707
would be we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place for	 2.204432884370057
all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of	 2.1759501816456672
he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring i had not	 3.2175333760183116
when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabeth	 2.4573658898319275
wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks this	 2.5485577665714256
all the unhappiness she had brought on her family if she heard me	 3.2658141102181175
of either lady catherine or her daughter colonel fitzwilliam had called	 2.3975896417752596
for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes but the case is	 2.8373240805568143
and made the important communication its effect was most	 3.6848527513998524
for me i should infinitely prefer a book	 3.737584815769126
agreeable	 3.76623271382471
and a book was produced but on beholding it for every thing announced	 2.648748250561396
consequent explanations	 2.20683721812523

mrs bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of	 2.484412506303638
if you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth colouring	 2.925851054605022
follows	 1.9905095457977273
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general i	 3.193173378856293
his fear of discovery by lydias relations for it had just transpired	 2.7366983623697974
should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to	 2.250903752802217
distinguished no part of the scene her thoughts were all fixed on that	 2.789396187249862
would be wisdom to resist all that i can promise you therefore is not	 3.452822505842981
of it to another not to you	 2.8631547569124085
a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and	 2.6014686718613405
coming towards them and concluding that she came to call them to their	 3.240960710625419

and you can copy and distribute it in the united states without	 2.986359940589311
satisfactory to tell you mr bingley does not know the whole of his	 3.0663812709444804
alarms being now removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of	 2.6510799438377055
of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness	 2.650441885951489
patchedup business at the expence of your father and uncles and is	 3.3588074537897437

this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we	 3.5427477122495503
her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who	 2.5436723686846983
satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingleys quick step	 3.422570268296852
ready to believe for every bodys sake that she may feel something	 2.335872544661177
to play and sing before any body and every bodyif my vanity had taken	 2.7581180287818827
in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting	 2.823721343846083
laugh as much as you chuse but you will not laugh me out of my	 2.9116785832121637
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or	 2.9621245298620305
so much both of mr darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was	 3.1577959119546306
appearance of it	 3.3400404030460336
with a look of doubt	 2.9308055247198066
engagement mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment	 4.249961978279707
sisters we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to	 3.0252277959674867
it is not true a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood	 2.7017610196145756
gutenbergtm work the foundation makes no representations concerning	 3.085285974046993
sure she can have no objectioncome kitty i want you up stairs and	 2.745585112601186
forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow	 2.471012275134873
and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of	 2.951135383104498
but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in	 2.2970419545518577
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them	 2.911351993891935
satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante	 2.723073718968792
and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his	 2.8548324988864175
master and his sister	 3.2983092137430323
what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and mr	 2.9161176520168217
engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of	 2.4664177403486245
then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of	 2.5067324216612072
well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not	 3.5083583311305286
pemberley you blamed me for coming	 3.4356218959332887
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the project	 3.206155703130248
this was his plan of amendsof atonementfor inheriting their fathers	 3.7211961244913234
fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that	 2.4607696509333574
letter she wrote also with great pleasure of her brothers being an	 2.4836280756563514
in the church and his cousin could have none at all	 3.3530249193022534
very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was	 3.239035701238444
was not unwelcome for its own sake the journey would moreover give her	 2.5121232284570607
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me	 3.167845475000145
countenance such an openness and gentleness in his manner	 4.535408277084546
looked almost wild	 3.050016615458806
departure she observed	 3.0392915316865428
i should not mind any thing at all	 2.6514070104626666
opened his lips the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was	 3.515760060547087
obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour	 2.5223652544975836
had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity	 3.1253962176795738
but you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviour as	 3.3575265583934844
welcome relief to him at rosings and mrs collinss pretty friend had	 2.469361630270107
and intelligence which might supply it among themselves if there were	 2.4013309641788148
ago	 3.8642877191460476
exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them because wickham has	 2.3799143005609436
miss lucas and herself	 3.14390079271757
things that you can do with most project gutenbergtm electronic works	 2.629769841131883
such terms	 3.401223360953616
there was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her	 2.804079543676632
somebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid	 2.5595632841994886
flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of	 3.014619381555329
will be renamed	 3.3003702717607397
vol iii	 2.20683721812523
distrust and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she	 3.7073253599249796
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by	 4.933679127504257
of fun the other day at colonel forsters kitty and me were to spend	 2.979649801785839
all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydia determined if	 2.8225909118626133
like regard and esteem for our cousin	 3.1791259568442944
comprehend what i must feel and i rely upon his goodness	 2.6579810266704125
kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without	 3.4227418632722215
may we take my uncles letter to read to her	 2.3054231852308003
affair became public	 3.0362892061724445
watchfulness has been effectual and though i should certainly be a more	 3.437311146606892
mr darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other	 2.552732705766037
happiness no no let me shift for myself and perhaps if i have very	 2.677868488382689
mr bingley followed his advice mr darcy walked off and elizabeth	 2.256869198128276
to part us if he were so they could not succeed by supposing such an	 2.818576993942154
friendless and who was actually staying in his colonels family that i	 3.0235457839704476
time make their past imprudence forgotten	 3.2645636461260827
when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose	 2.853745500262662
observances which he supposed a regular part of the business on finding	 2.9530843042268287
heartily they were wished away by some of the family mrs hurst and her	 3.020080487208989
substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on	 3.60279078021218
chapter xi	 1.9484968389608204
in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on	 2.4228213062620476
have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is but now it comes out	 2.1322440802105924
take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the	 2.7916842189309756
but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the	 3.0077889555017827
painful than elizabeths but whatever she felt she was desirous of	 2.918120624051776
respects there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for	 3.6739037009757363
the world and every body hoped that he would never come there again	 2.911229176488112
elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude	 2.8898989362673713
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the	 2.9318274825325226
mrs hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed	 3.300784753349957
that the chimneypiece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all	 3.6987717639791398
to say the truth i was too cross to write you supposed more than	 2.560305212091188
should not have known her again	 3.0308789896176735
my news it is about dear wickham too good for the waiter is not it	 3.0031454585980004
consequence of any reply mr collins might never make the offer and	 2.228735386882354
that she did not always know when she was silent	 3.097211201391741
your relations	 3.449113048273132
you have a house in town i conclude	 3.043471534859778
catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves	 2.637196404864853
mr collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife	 2.368040213087442
less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now	 2.4098937801868705
oh but the gentlemen will have mr bingleys chaise to go to meryton	 2.478788315059327
far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with	 3.103685732747393
slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of	 3.406729276444864
easily learnt had never been his design he confessed himself	 2.709595146488108
before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy	 3.0715680547702666
connubial felicity really was an union of a different tendency and	 3.650273751291552
sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the	 2.694057966526182
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss	 3.3047497645718464
restrain her astonishment from being visible never even in the company	 2.318716107932406
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more	 2.748440384936552
never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth	 2.4901711034392076
bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn	 3.9171105540720945
of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at	 2.4462068558624153
family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that	 2.7679870303202967
and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings	 2.346708347961404
netherfield long enough she attracted him more than he likedand miss	 2.8393111630396355
had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended	 2.9011629130945784
elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any	 2.376077349488658
fitzwilliams words and these strong objections probably were her	 2.2284367289781466
for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so	 3.710605165127072
ask for compassion her home and her housekeeping her parish and her	 3.5345046739205532
contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those	 3.9292951914242584
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the	 3.7413733168215404
much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be	 3.0676188321826188
had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday several of	 3.4145321309852563
elizabeth was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on seeing	 2.2685236348899402
insensibility of danger security for happiness	 2.539779499711759
they were just returned from the library where such and such officers	 2.284283096435114
you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew	 2.5046711300956694
the men shant come and part us i am determined we want none of them	 2.3328447603511697
markettown where the family did not visit it was acknowledged	 2.331323217811126

project gutenbergtm is synonymous with the free distribution of	 3.2846926619331223
darcy did not wish for cards and mr hurst soon found even his open	 2.6300972360536354
if one could but go to brighton observed mrs bennet	 2.455777312715194
you begin to comprehend me do you cried he turning towards her	 2.240666560866161
you need not distress yourself the moral will be perfectly fair lady	 2.574142213212029
overcome had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture	 3.4292897295319484
who i believe will soon become a part of the family	 2.9462139964639324
imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must	 2.7614021956424133
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real	 2.8515528442562115
could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easiness	 2.3328718011085066
courted you therei have saved you the trouble of accounting for it	 3.871527007809359
suddenly got up and saying to kitty	 2.6866424088410583
feelings though fervent were little displayed and that there was a	 3.4382133540400823
hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill	 2.527659092986026
uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the	 4.1515833242741635
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run	 3.3046503448676945

perhaps probablebut his regard did not appear to me enough	 2.6435875394936215

wickhams so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire in	 2.649835818130458
had been too ingenious for her on opening the door she perceived her	 2.6726815460295357
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer	 2.9534382973560325

took place	 3.4021414076833003
i understood that there were some very strong objections against the	 2.296445529684393

the impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn	 2.711963566970035
but three miles from them were the first points of selfgratulation	 2.8399879001280324

how good it was in you my dear mr bennet but i knew i should	 2.8431260960597453
think better of me did you on reading it give any credit to its	 2.2527756820579725

as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will	 2.4327630484449028
and he soon afterwards said aloud mr bennet have you no more lanes	 2.417564417843666
give which a just sense of shame would not conceal with a strong	 2.5487381601604713
longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could	 2.5094605541724166
be told the history of his acquaintance with mr darcy she dared not	 4.187074894827599

too far off i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for	 2.6904039378549296
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be	 3.234068098747294
while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart	 2.3817535052974805
governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of	 3.3149286595501644
resolvednor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the	 3.002221270336243
housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the	 3.4875593239432146
my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley	 2.1884260811163423
arrangement he would scarcely be ten pounds ayear the loser by the	 3.304319262595031
and they must marry yet he is such a man	 2.951375172522516
she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a	 3.0655561136833724
the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured	 3.109721712409777
you will never get a husband at alland i am sure i do not know who is	 2.838630690687768
but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike	 2.4842452829832258
mother and kitty made inevitable and could she have included jane in	 2.5919033962999194
mr darcy replied with great intrepidity	 3.022887562433965
to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may	 4.133258647282278
to hope that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire the day	 2.2242217200079724
it	 3.040429572705547
for there was much to be discussed wickham of course wanted more	 2.997898763280035

as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance but though	 4.752122463030093
suppose to believe them fond of each other	 2.5797129858206906
going thither but charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan	 2.9338373018716983
being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and mrs	 3.5573792610002037
she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on	 3.763366763407306
knowing what she did she accepted him he walked away again	 2.728919805735619

grantleys	 1.9905095457977273
in this interference from what she had said of her resolution to	 2.944537048773521
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means	 2.2357717148128065
somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham	 3.8030445962381694
him but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that	 3.0059874284842407

so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make	 3.4580026358991893
in this mannerin such society and indeed i am quite of your opinion	 2.6999715730795977

the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would	 2.6868087823680873
could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to	 3.5068062714855563
i should be sorry indeed if it were we were always good friends	 2.6253376770479098

her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally	 2.593190055180349
would be gone with such celerity your conduct would be quite as	 2.6159948554110173
each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the	 3.386561628757586
a constant state of change if you are outside the united states check	 2.9305748430259846
thousand tender recollections his behaviour to myself has been	 3.226062218586593
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish self reproach she could find	 4.818721653469123
to complete the favourable impression she then told him what mr darcy	 2.731732599337701

upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for	 2.2358419371693934
elizabeth made no answer she was afraid of talking longer of his	 2.436893103731103
her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with	 3.5389101384722728
as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great	 2.5387766326179078
such a study in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined	 3.5688129015913734
brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my fathers	 2.3166089578846223
forster it will be quite a shame if he does not	 3.5637061608857277
more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the	 2.6274056378783626
you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into	 2.382819202051781

eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it he added that mr	 3.580489215704797
she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked	 3.39496298290527
condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if	 3.5457326681975907
perfectly ignorant of what had happened they went to the library	 2.9480174787020124
wait in the drawingroom and whose shyness as they had not seen her	 3.0966263978294806
manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any	 3.6990298948884837
a father acknowledged the whole to me you may imagine what i felt	 2.3009741302613262
him you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence	 3.1215448360162865
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr	 2.550392931311872
who have been kept aloof by lydias folly	 2.795653917877419
bennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle	 2.800821331192775

of their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it was	 3.1261316658706377
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords exclaiming	 3.1895644684795124
is very pretty but i thought i might as well buy it as not i shall	 2.6996242071238
at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about	 2.686779014083722
lawn it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the	 3.5426585980174075
if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield	 2.7040275464504604
and how i acted regard for my sisters credit and feelings	 2.5331735243535864
been well looked after i always thought they were very unfit to have	 2.786934602296533
extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others	 2.3061160538076875
not the smallest hope it is every way horrible	 2.6200521824085388
mistaken indulgence towards such a girloh how acutely did she now	 3.3533410247462996
subject as usual elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their	 2.365277502132826
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements mrs	 2.96374924239511
unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a	 3.032687943031876
give them as unstudied an air as possible	 3.0554655979951377
she said as he walked up and down the street and had mr wickham	 3.0912647235294908
alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed	 3.767085436547907
the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the	 2.8090203038886745
paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected on the	 2.8444991476206716
unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often	 2.2490593499508
venture near her lest she might hear too much when they sat down to	 2.5123692253110392
to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me	 3.4652730379125787
but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so	 3.168610796517808
next morning to london	 3.1094175869783944
womanly and graceful she was less handsome than her brother but there	 2.6984334361480258
collinss side and as many bows on sir williams they departed as	 2.750062763950183
unwillingly said so miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only	 2.9482111980377
imagine that you are gratifying mine	 3.5037219793553067
elizabeths astonishment was beyond expression she stared coloured	 2.9563967663017006
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner but do you think she	 2.8473651444176484
success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine	 2.69378082832065
bingley vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her	 2.4882904497681335
mr collinss triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete	 2.9308347774940735
in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently	 2.8475573176942106
head and sat down without saying a word elizabeth had mentioned her	 2.4363842598279692
going away myself	 3.110827041415382
vain and nonsensical as i knew i had oh how i wanted you	 2.9778250074771626
she had chosen	 3.4273682350657277
work of the morning and pack her trunk afresh	 3.9871177140371143
him often and after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man	 3.6746732579658237
achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i	 2.8340962556318248
moment alighted from his horse or his carriage she blushed again and	 2.9720483985982464
better looking it is what every body says i do not trust my own	 2.718609213815541
when the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to elizabeth	 3.7486000029849342
with every body and had so many favourites	 2.739310518266818
character i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes but he is a	 2.677330055123669
commendation to think of her as he chose	 2.904591863201527
and i certainly never shall give it i am not to be intimidated into	 3.17692081111128
every attempt of mrs bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a	 2.368060048706559
any thing	 3.306197046150293
interest but nothing to justify enquiry	 3.4865799719414987
cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my	 3.695004874295858
together as to what is to be done	 3.2605780322786364
father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their	 2.514354748680154
history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have	 2.513407594512899
us as soon as you returned i have not forgot you see and i assure	 3.2045492922160306
inmate of mr darcys house and mentioned with raptures some plans of	 2.838382767367483
impertinence your uncle is as much surprised as i amand nothing	 2.595586803709958
awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage	 3.7668129613970818
if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which	 2.6812068330824097
in her nature however to increase her vexations by dwelling on them	 4.105669398426735
this and all associated files of various formats will be found in	 4.228052398916439
returned to his civil enquiries after her family amazed at the	 2.9779995042027165
ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening	 4.851747197845227

chapter xi	 1.9484968389608204
i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short	 3.328962046544659
thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be	 4.1475689499817845
accepting it is not it so mrs bennet	 3.121057057896562
true said mr bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of	 3.5004352673076067
lasting convenience of that kind but perhaps his sister does as well	 2.734191788947272

female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the	 3.421419958337525
make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she	 2.759925334036149
could not be seen and mr darcy found on further enquiry that	 3.3184476376509324
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be	 3.0148919745798035
she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far	 3.4380575518241785
him whether he intended to accept mr bingleys invitation and if he	 2.464337001918431
she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some ones	 4.206935230540773
strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so	 3.2792417660991764
little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded	 2.872181738764768
when we are better acquainted	 3.0861041473589124
by other men you had better return to your partner and enjoy her	 2.4790601965258445
assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could	 4.582841303355066
i do not knowi hope there wasbut to be guarded at such a time is	 3.3878671435738106
and if he does colonel forster will hire him my aunt told me so	 2.5690220477564405
acquaintance	 3.7571583647685465
told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you	 3.1462356372780387
yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension	 2.7281602594372645
ever had any thing from him except a few presents well i am so happy	 2.9100892490110635
i flatter myself that my present overtures of goodwill are highly	 3.509150592479009
you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy	 3.2841775159054456
insolent girl said elizabeth to herselfyou are much mistaken if	 2.661808619884655
remain freely available for generations to come in 2001 the project	 3.333099628346442
your written explanation the person or entity that provided you with	 3.1648865961037767
sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon	 2.9046588342279476
quickness than her sisters	 3.1577056461981683
having slighted one of her daughters	 2.934990853398778
the executors of my fathers will has been unavoidably acquainted	 3.187665738206606
distressed himself a small sum could not do all this	 3.0877213946577453
you are quite a visit in my debt mr bingley she added for when	 2.784409371172938
when one has a motive only three miles i shall be back by dinner	 2.292038773002747
that mr collins wants to marry lizzy	 3.253905146956725
yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement	 2.785604275319096
bestowed it most unwillingly i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any	 3.1890625227299014
elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply	 2.821459120940934
the bridge and perceived their distance from the house mrs gardiner	 2.435402427883698
oh no said elizabeth in essentials i believe he is very much	 3.116283488743291
was her only alternative she declared her resolution	 2.6292925131004647
otherwise explained	 3.396904207809672
cambric and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders had	 3.3927346585979477
features though not plain were insignificant and she spoke very	 3.2675300653911763
in charlottes did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence	 3.4982787026548565
attentions of the officers to whom her uncles good dinners and her own	 3.0347235757342386
afraid you will be angry	 3.5410838586594435
upon this information they instantly passed through the hall once more	 2.42130906253333
his concern at having been prevented by business they then went away	 2.3608257797281404
temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day when	 2.7225890369682375
told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter	 2.5378106768169424
else gave way before the hope of janes being in the fairest way for	 2.989117579090428
against your will against your reason and even against your character	 2.2564747132054896
of course she will be always at pemberley with you	 2.8787128269707263
in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had	 2.62096936671655
and down the room in earnest meditation his brow contracted his air	 3.9260546170280226
give him a good name some people call him proud but i am sure i never	 2.7647519326164027
mrs reynoldss respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this	 3.1566952820820835
but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see	 2.5533131307708423
as his marriage was fixed on and i think you will agree with me	 2.714484642966359
there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did	 2.4145619138802936
did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was	 2.632397920979286
concurrence	 1.9905095457977273
every body says that he is ate up with pride and i dare say he had	 3.06900005390773
into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his	 3.4914037900476558
in a few minutes mrs bennet half opened the door and called out	 2.608042078480549
of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the	 3.1054631583389876
the winter and concluded with her brothers regret at not having had	 3.062228079555039
mr fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud illnatured	 2.494651414532576
yes indeed cried mrs bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a	 3.192467815309467
him he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he	 3.169069752328972
fixed them on her more and more cheerfully	 2.8147092003742173
the officersand if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to	 3.1357177702144847
for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the	 2.4444308914647848
even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave	 2.423225124125512
assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenbergtms	 3.404751837011551

she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell	 3.6376994163068446
all she does not yet leave her dressingroom mary and kitty thank	 2.5920283635556864
what do you think she said besides ah mrs bennet we shall have her	 2.719842936443959

daughter he protested that she should receive from him no mark of	 3.5175540859426144
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent your profusion	 2.883800695396329
disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her	 2.3895807294969207
without anger such treatment but sir williams good breeding carried	 2.6376717077541305
done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem her	 2.5531872122571446
believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from	 3.0062310900388813

merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready	 3.3135645258231143
would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone elizabeth blushed	 2.5826371416427674

how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning mr darcy she cried i	 2.351897608055973
meryton was within a walk of longbourn they would be going there for	 2.2931530549790344
opportunity of dancing a reel	 2.85610290167745
taken into the house and as soon as they were in the parlour he	 3.835769899603642
remarked he meant to make enquiries at clapham if he could any how	 2.798405990583855
all young ladies accomplished my dear charles what do you mean	 3.1691975128770147
agreeable he would have talked to mrs long but i can guess how it was	 2.990890661347574
and her children should go to london at the same time that mr bennet	 2.618422983207699
last night names facts every thing mentioned without ceremonyif it	 2.8326391939349547
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt	 2.755765178998177

when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister	 2.5893596967211145
seemed nothing but absence of mind	 2.57772957060242
much he will give her stay stay i will go myself ring the bell	 2.54471394860922
i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in	 2.7252034295566547
yours ever	 3.326625401015408
eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once	 2.985346673430848
from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally	 3.1176923324198005
indulgent as to let him come to us again	 2.562754948859833
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr wickham when	 3.574634109882976
1f4 except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth	 3.2223512722837784
mr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickhams removal	 3.434089485615625
favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest	 2.2429856142911127
forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared	 3.0346555616164412
yes replied wickhamhis estate there is a noble one a clear ten	 2.681773523420376
garden gate	 3.439085102105984
husbands what a pity it is mamma we did not all go	 3.654560052690524
such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than mrs	 3.519449179440178
in spite of her deeplyrooted dislike she could not be insensible to	 4.082614836539165
it and could not help saying so	 3.222064255943386
contrary he was all attention to every body by nature inoffensive	 2.5005579713004855
pemberley	 3.434662637837426
shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to	 3.1216245278974504
idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is	 2.5294533210656605
that is charming three daughters married ten thousand a year oh	 2.3379400390932767
have been said and silence was very awkward she wanted to talk but	 2.7371030416332336
proud without being vain pride relates more to our opinion of	 2.2766140038343563
mind charlotte tried to console her	 3.015578949166905
different sort of men and that he hates me	 3.4788594086338076
if we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we may	 2.3868704282158286
evening party and he bore with the illjudged officiousness of the	 4.008212286050584
about a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject	 3.210380274078182
farther	 3.8342194049907072
more than we had and the consciousness of this was another	 3.664806340151068
it is not mr bingley said her husband it is a person whom i	 2.9266758725332758
very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings and	 2.490871404916983
soon married to mr bingleyit was an animating subject and mrs	 2.7845246924476195
and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to	 3.4798720780485883
almost took from me my faculties	 2.910654610476972
she was still full of indignation but when she considered how unjustly	 2.877214475688726
continued with little intermission to the very day of lydias leaving	 3.4570740680937435
blind to miss bingleys inattention after waiting at home every morning	 3.320698443760064
her a very good sort of girl there can be no love in all this my	 2.8299456428101535
oh dearyescertainlyi am sure lizzy will be very happyi am	 2.935851144506771
shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness lady	 2.87298907951066
nonsensical to come at all why must she be scampering about the	 2.568642414430249
aunt it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he	 2.6485071345574176
reasonable young woman but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i	 2.6579455900855424
deserving her mothers reproach prevented his feeling any regret	 2.543664142794844
we may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as	 2.573676920514096
if your master would marry you might see more of him	 2.3454975530080846
her for a woman who had already refused him as able to overcome a	 3.019547039909148
settled they were to be off as soon as possible but what is to be	 3.379424131743099
one morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two	 2.6450543331435052
she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind	 4.103672503019091
elizabeth did not know what to make of it had she not seen him in	 3.0884054800634235
i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an	 2.2265334109569586
librarytheir father was in neither and they were on the point of	 2.567562258852619
miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing mr darcy in any	 3.986998240309064
are removed of course we hope that you will support the project	 2.983135525559
stupider person	 3.3912185407921016
attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them	 2.37674030955475
breathing port wine who followed them into the room	 2.9511812624787774
not yet replied jane but now that my dear uncle is come i hope	 2.4252757409011014
is nothing the matter with me i am quite well i am only distressed by	 2.8293465102413284
that will atone for such wretchedness as this let me never see either	 3.1055044168707413
gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth and	 2.9480463949549884
nonsense	 1.9905095457977273
disagreeable	 3.1011792294501954
saying your opinion of him is sunk we must not be so ready to fancy	 2.9260039865218506

after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was	 3.15504742333911
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object there	 2.582952695518802
one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so	 2.136756401975641
but my father cannothe wrote last week to hurry my return	 2.2856890059779404
of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition	 2.7467025524355364

if you are not so compassionate as to dine today with louisa and	 3.7466904754771893
siryou will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching	 3.1274439912293603
hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again today	 2.7490379275890713
on the very last day of the regiments remaining in meryton he dined	 4.185017759841131
the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge	 3.402819602819271
do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in	 2.249322816339382
were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i	 3.016573428443007
any wish of doing him justice he expressed no regret for what he had	 2.3270365495297716
herself such was miss lucass scheme and appearances were so	 2.5847149659013833
farther to wish	 3.2359964870589204
wanted to counteract her mothers schemes	 3.6152735136075647
been for her own perverseness he made her an offer in this very room	 2.577668623850209
thing in his power to satisfy us on this head but on second thoughts	 2.6419295627246675
inconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity	 3.6887772875005935
this was not very consoling to mrs bennet and therefore instead of	 3.4207297848066953
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn and what with the philipses	 2.727935234789741
satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the	 2.5504145482008025
i would not be so fastidious as you are cried bingley for a	 3.5457558967010265
but it had not been so in derbyshire there he had talked to her	 2.569745107043706
feelings followed them in silence she was overpowered by shame and	 3.4370747395113597
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane	 2.604879849759054
such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not	 3.3187687729707376
this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure	 3.9928772966194024
turned silently away mrs bennet who fancied she had gained a complete	 3.4304157222651224
de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will	 4.46003214123722
walk to meryton she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist	 3.5658862596456515
darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth	 2.3419842005702702
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion	 2.8617674233037413
was very obstinate i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real	 3.3563895162197555
elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the	 2.9406362790343374
think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next	 2.4754557274569535
speak she in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydias	 2.8097385801336934
contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long	 2.3799930113089065
to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any	 2.652167752533808
pride prejudice	 2.797721874036103
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink the	 3.334881719741602
elizabeth but it is not in my power to accept iti must be in town	 3.532793220975945
half a mile and then found themselves at the top of a considerable	 4.024032897431637
manner	 3.43816644029785
those points where he most wants care from something that he told me in	 2.399006404882769
thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and	 2.2172093998640694
with the family and with a bow to mr darcy he concluded his speech	 4.159490392683536
walk as they were superior to the broadfaced stuffy uncle philips	 3.9431022268902916
the effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw	 3.548172980456343
colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send	 2.4856166753238025
the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some	 3.112475723567653
attention in the whole course of his life	 2.9116081515299173
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she	 4.2251572641376685
significant look and smile from mrs annesley to miss darcy had been	 2.917755207743683

enter the paddock and ride towards the house	 3.8293576783815215
on as a point of duty pardon me for neglecting to profit by your	 3.454960447264708
worth knowing after all	 2.950547407138954
so totally independent of every one	 4.4039725585933915
to invite him to read aloud to the ladies mr collins readily assented	 2.560025395030992
of her chair not knowing which way to look elizabeth found herself	 2.5623985753542087
dear sir	 3.062651138379224
you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with	 2.424157826393316
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned	 2.7483231330553086
at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted	 2.6501913655618874
she is my youngest girl but one my youngest of all is lately married	 2.2182109856300736
again	 3.6231218447234
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her the expression	 2.4983193248476288
dear lizzy	 3.3818328929201145
melancholy conviction of her husbands never intending to go there	 2.975716529860856
me should make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented	 3.639414263053064
manhe is a great friend of darcys	 2.9388539465283676
for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he	 2.5469474371643694
thousand pounds or any thing like it has been advanced he has	 3.1001189087311847
curiosity to see the view from the mount and elizabeth silently	 3.9660192092650575
prejudiced absurd	 2.20683721812523
disposition and talents would most suit her his understanding and	 2.5859296322260916
civil for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well	 2.6317691060155757
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every	 2.6133702775170393
oh my dear eliza pray make haste and come into the diningroom for	 3.1643057842918374
second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasant it	 3.3086792417502653
have nothing to guide us colonel forster will i dare say do every	 3.238055134594266
the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison	 2.8332387436968265
hall the diningroom and all its furniture were examined and praised	 3.9564340044474413
heart in the world she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice	 3.080381481599995
made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the	 4.061496139453689
it for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone	 2.990953575451341
hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report for what do we	 3.285515410621886
the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she	 4.1424306423490105
i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate if it was	 2.892311913156979
and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the	 2.4633847815547987
another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his	 3.1517803681288377
this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter said	 2.25624235708715
she is a most charming young lady indeed lady catherine herself says	 2.504981040824644
such a flutter that i am sure i cant write so i will dictate and you	 3.653211793254013
at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few	 2.9591457097775655
has done no harm to any one but myself	 3.7418463934524118
charlotte wisely did not hear after sitting long enough to admire every	 2.883971736683467
interferingand elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and	 2.727505959102777
lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a	 2.8280305176415452
and that i suppose is one of your sisters	 3.2507373942504763
consolation to such distressbut i will not torment you with vain	 3.667741406197888
calling her attention this observation would not have prevented her	 2.5998250945439456
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by	 2.664769681692288
as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side miss	 2.545762110725698
intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views	 3.872629105766555
secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging	 2.3925876375770523
longbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general	 4.307118720322421
i have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to his being	 2.589491821790742
as it was the express was sent off to longbourn but our visitor	 2.670487449829293
shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight	 3.544247461920084
to hope before i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that	 2.3948768579996824
ones own daughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr	 2.3945806070184688
liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a	 2.6896720234809277
i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation	 2.6358466096191426
tears in her eyes that a sisters sense of decency and virtue in such	 3.570366594448884
nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side	 2.27473016924535
economy and other amiable qualifications	 2.6342447475180166
had said enough to keep him quiet	 2.67672210458268
confusion and unable to lift up her eyes had miss bingley known what	 2.504737796471234
she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see	 2.6486366554695326
inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved mrs gardiner and	 3.3348277586698525
la you are so strange but i must tell you how it went off we were	 3.034082017069615
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither	 2.756934090178008
inclination to see the place again mr gardiner declared his	 2.586108254387726
upon yourself alone	 3.018195615112939
is that his design in settling here	 2.66212300552501
yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but that	 2.5589529268296984
hope and i was determined at once to know every thing	 2.6707621308965113
herself not at all offended but he continued to apologise for about a	 3.7329264281351624
what do you mean hill we have heard nothing from town	 2.6615466222576885
us all which must arise from the public notice of lydias unguarded and	 3.0901727702179116
his uncle lord and to the great surprise of all the party when	 2.680960436502835
matters till they reached the parsonage there shut into her own room	 2.59413917816521
another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with him	 2.856145866631792
over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked	 2.7923262646187017
civil also and say what the occasion required she performed her part	 2.414006268961145
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must	 3.2606449051093804
possible that he will marry her	 3.186056407872357
greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally	 2.942775341405142
confined for time my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer	 3.0628206698191
when he first came into the room in no countenance was attentive	 2.6638704926024626
august 2	 2.20683721812523
my own such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might	 3.0304279514441985
i was never more annoyed the insipidity and yet the noise the	 3.6605347849305474
behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure	 3.4030356064741785
be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find	 3.116058580726697
she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no	 2.7756094721345432
jane shook her head	 3.0253823090524463
if you do	 3.5810841645500813
settlement there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming	 3.0099016941190384

would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of	 3.46288072964977
shall now know how to act do not imagine miss bennet that your	 2.9513859074033064
we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said	 2.406765903912478
husbands love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their	 2.7513153841733127
behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of	 3.3685080382043715
defect of his character after all he has been accused of many	 3.053079734841648
elizabeth was summoned to dinner to the civil enquiries which then	 2.72326600732471
dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr darcys	 4.262824889761939
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his	 2.4972769862091804
the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the	 4.526748871732644
as well as greater certainty absence had increased her desire of seeing	 2.7787159504256578
fancied herself nervous the business of her life was to get her	 2.7656454756819113
by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by	 2.492484312914691
what none of you	 2.935931644956114
could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydias note to his	 3.051783910266146
arrangement at the waroffice another regiment should be quartered in	 3.4015583217365695
time i am perfectly serious in my refusalyou could not make me	 3.239181604180599
i am sick of mr bingley cried his wife	 3.4070010068068406
if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone	 2.292122917959512
i like her appearance said elizabeth struck with other ideas she	 2.213446958415209
pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it she	 3.655824201162253
which yesterday had produced but above all above respect and esteem	 2.383496902582646
side and that if it were it must belong to mr darcy the superior in	 3.458497084319375
never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter	 2.991887381513407
mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her	 3.3925568146149465
his parishioners whenever it were required	 2.6510762160039874
including how to make donations to the project gutenberg literary	 2.6326077227293507
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a	 3.4074586057878538
it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be	 3.27350125578596
says happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over	 2.184933856021665
from pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her	 2.3605884152713883
it was my brother gardiners drawing up too and i wonder how he came to	 2.3451588567904085
to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision	 3.2460109721651524
the latter with regard to new furniture	 2.77341224154443
complain of it as her husbandit was very strange that he should come	 4.466653711545436
steady gravity	 3.484023119697713
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a	 4.577093870470451
prepare and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real	 2.924585613460444
extraordinary for on first hearing it mrs bennet sat quite still and	 2.127383074358504
found wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in	 2.4397258584770554
introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an	 2.486365519953095
i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as	 2.8423908120921464
understanding than i now do of her heart my dear jane mr collins is	 2.4983739147237816
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get	 2.742762768887563
attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself we can all	 3.606070511013047
lived not like the wild young men nowadays who think of nothing but	 2.406500101167644
the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing	 2.1933608185505458
observed my friends behaviour attentively and i could then	 3.1053657466111657
would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november	 2.4622958067837084
be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made	 3.564212385512925
oh yeshe was to come there with wickham you know but gracious me	 2.609029189155285
she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it	 3.0992105501997678
interest in him	 3.1749906654014897
naturally lively enough and we all know that wickham has every charm of	 2.6096175634481673
could be more natural than his asking you again he could not help	 2.7565059295920307
about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready	 4.171715714897912
sisters i should not care how proud i was i would keep a pack of	 2.5841451188482654
no indeed i did noti knew nothing at all of lady catherines	 2.7496205774916103
but you will know it when i have told you what happened the very	 2.5829397652395407
we have gonewe will recollect what we have seen lakes mountains	 2.758443343581543
blow as this she was humbled she was grieved she repented though she	 4.5930369855098405
hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her	 3.1331427764322313
please read this before you distribute or use this work	 2.3306517654737635
refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discompose	 3.400562897820771
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion	 4.777859665617838
by herself the path just admitted three mr darcy felt their rudeness	 2.5050858334283026
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of	 3.2744711388227095
oddly	 1.9905095457977273
prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished and their	 2.879407044853566
speed through the neighbourhood it was borne in the latter with decent	 4.042127128839522
could flatter herself with such an expectation surprise was the least	 2.71184823706978
that is as it happens it does not necessarily follow that a deep	 3.0384069297185703
i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied	 2.3242529669226526
compassion on my nerves you tear them to pieces	 3.6693944670046954
we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest	 3.3964902915561095
prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were	 2.950913487064484
wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for	 2.4956512244027693
every hour in his esteem	 3.11496777539214
waterplant there chanced to be a little alteration it originated in	 4.273213198678463
pleasing than any other man	 3.061379936883734
soon dispatched for though dilatory in undertaking business he was	 3.3395697999289444
where is your sister said he hastily as he opened the door	 2.970784737281518
her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them	 2.7820872204406446
you dare	 3.389633194772917

hurry and confusion of the following hour had elizabeth been at leisure	 3.2376105586726482
miss bennet still looked all amazement elizabeth again and more	 2.4631015417637343

you shall have it in few words miss bingley sees that her brother is	 2.7622636538471306
i have heard from authority which i thought as good that it was	 2.7248563366974743
his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and	 2.518012482479515
acquaintance in common and though wickham had been little there since	 2.4699983050925014
and writing and looking out of window in his own book room which	 2.293973851577287

what can it proceed it cannot be for me it cannot be for my sake	 2.8613160501962747
i have said no such thing i am only resolved to act in that manner	 2.9691091456514256
i cannot do justice to his kindness he meant to provide for me amply	 2.5630490800299763

that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and	 2.919317635625949
it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added	 2.583540309148584

mr wickhams society was of material service in dispelling the gloom	 3.876118557781693
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet the	 2.9893860807239387
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word after a short pause	 3.051156067995303

far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his	 2.466442923465214
trust i am resigned perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my	 2.7564857463608967

how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that	 2.6478386977280746
ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise but no	 2.858879878378871
ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly	 2.7367285497135354
nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter	 2.9772095500844458

charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she	 3.006251245884004
difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded	 2.8599655345906423
with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it	 2.64726221098357
consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match i thought it my duty	 3.300464014654546
you do not blame me however for refusing him	 3.05484764629743

drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs bennets being quite	 3.50676503466346
yes but when questioned by him denny denied knowing any thing of	 2.550227812377036
he brought it with him for us to see	 2.838302783629723
their corps this was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted	 2.8867342612180664

evening by the bye mrs forster and me are such friends and so	 2.8054716143832943
take it on myself	 2.942571519672206
which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming	 3.2454767481538256
income go a good way this is my advice find such a woman as soon as	 2.4314833228656143
my style of writing is very different from yours	 2.529313715119466
again and again it was hardly enough but it pleased her she was even	 2.45029455514554
should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large	 2.370192961848359
a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and	 3.888749393497356
regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their	 3.4384764383668363
doubt of your secrecy my sister who is more than ten years my	 3.0539753403790577
pray tell your sister that i long to see her	 2.610967572884706
of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which shewed her	 3.2150786260638147
not hesitate	 3.207356764642539
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which	 3.0676262516899473
reason but your arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation	 3.6708415661623945
mrs gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her	 2.7900981862247334
most creditable to his heart i am sincerely grieved for him and	 4.647073110680108
privilege of universal good will you need not there are few people	 2.7584166378446784
became by proper attention and management less irritable less	 2.6154780985504886
and goodhumoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose	 2.623787208781329
i assure you madam he replied that she does not need such advice	 2.5677337920985273
he did not say what she then took a large house in edwardstreet	 2.5584713444935883
expressively at lydia but she who never heard nor saw any thing of	 2.2496516130440356
important elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr darcy	 2.7040120638358744
would come in the evening this was agreed to and mrs philips	 2.767295132401744
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the	 4.8224468148540405
were to entertain each other very little was said by either kitty was	 2.3886462321492155
complimented her on bearing it so well	 3.391861285288972
but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little	 2.6221406912077385
this ever induce me to be explicit	 3.304767884365806
happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never	 2.641594551297986
family the far and the near must be relative and depend on many	 2.8200098673493637
him was ecstacy	 3.2237008758959416
might arise in that quarter it distressed her a little and she was	 3.2170782697589795
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence	 3.1840982109839353
lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been	 3.828404936111025
of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this	 3.7305863081029735
can all plague and punish one another teaze himlaugh at	 4.3175595054816025
on his cousin allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with	 3.081787653728945
that she might have been mr collinss wife by this time had not it	 2.9314350147015587
daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship	 2.579854885275558
before had been almost an angel of light he was declared to be in debt	 2.6966729086144627
fluctuating but never without an object the mischief of neglect and	 3.0896144233932157
the subject by saying but tell me all and every thing about it which	 2.4151848554472206
chapter vii	 1.9484968389608204
know that i am not to be trifled with but however insincere you may	 3.8327422876176724
not one	 3.3699616006817
and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room	 3.7574026058732
of happiness were within thirty miles of each other	 2.7279568167450496
and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for	 2.7997494115106396
as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my	 2.532243302496421
rings joined now and then in her brothers conversation with miss	 2.479940999442043

of itoh that abominable mr darcymy fathers opinion of me does	 3.1132237055091294

of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i	 2.302659289435812
he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while	 2.876548212123024
and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it	 3.773135242447092
you dislike him	 3.0471794838118216
jane with such dreadful news it cannot be concealed from any one my	 2.854914099216757
though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall	 3.3502450818932554
said for the present	 3.2207826934608192
but really considering his descent one could not expect much better	 2.4145577735271995
house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted	 3.268434015421505
that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not	 3.536502088849938
the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same	 2.5789994069043387
do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place	 3.224852924764744
it was some time however before a smile could be extorted from jane	 2.953496594604509
after a few minutes reflection however she continued i do remember	 2.763747506477903
temper i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride	 2.3169305361586296
of the regiments approaching removal was indeed beyond expression in	 2.7141876481205776
their visit to rosings mr collins was carefully instructing them in	 3.865801106272011
but circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging	 2.8818365140142035
last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice i	 3.1913239498989254
summer	 3.800261273646881
ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship	 3.4722970797150294
intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter	 3.589200361270067
and in their brothers manners there was something better than	 2.4176255126813757
shape of a lover to any of them she began at length to recover to	 3.262316542158127
than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs when they	 2.8812041936844275
bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy	 3.100012312434145
was to speak for itself he called it therefore his duty to step	 2.220226134623042
former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that	 3.0072605482829795
do you know mama that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard	 2.445177845642984
some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing	 2.573791055785571
angry but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained	 2.435507142293948
the judge they are in the same profession you know only in different	 2.85224511471465
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and already had	 2.6502862353395003
to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are	 5.524645327936508
elizabeth shook her head over this letter it convinced her that	 2.3800689969539106
impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of	 3.0117371186809727
expose himself to such a man mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained	 3.519312073191678
the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good	 3.11660280039758
but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white	 3.548822105469106
four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him she endeavoured to	 2.7495478358528205
arising from so illjudged a direction of talents talents which rightly	 4.3378153515872855
thing in all this dirt you will not be fit to be seen when you get	 4.028133801970162
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of	 2.977635945015794
tears an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by	 2.412107443356911
your ladyship has declared it to be impossible	 2.7081368443576816

you i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you	 2.3376163309110436
have a right to such very strong local attachment you cannot have	 2.475936705056593
master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed	 2.871139412035371
tell you all	 3.1439432134753
the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice	 4.266778594625601

all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds	 3.49699067010732
i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister said he	 3.7448524485071424
seemed danger of lydias engrossing him entirely for she was a most	 2.976733747925777
yesbut he seemed to like his second better	 2.623921807410331
a novel	 2.8125332716185554
in which you have been brought up	 3.6161109858119875
fitzwilliam what do i play next my fingers wait your orders	 2.3193601049045305
their visit as they returned except what had particularly interested	 2.270352570808244
which her rank will inevitably excite thus much for my general	 3.0312337256234527
wickham really is we both know that he has been profligate in every	 3.1750814323798013
wholly unexpected i had not an idea of it	 3.0770357378533966
writing my sisters may write to me they will have nothing else to	 2.5910388427846085
others all that his library afforded	 2.6811013914351958
afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately	 2.9868755216490968
spirits oppressively high no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her	 4.013285455917812
one of them does	 3.423390456535669
from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my	 2.3853578679303813
of good humour which youth and beauty generally give had married a	 2.338341041706041
all copies of project gutenbergtm electronic works in your possession	 3.0594688960862397
with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity	 3.1238575796488743
discharged to settle on my niece in addition to her own fortune	 3.7410187173976204
they should have opposed their brothers what sister would think	 2.7463654306946155
illnature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not	 4.674155468287535
till she could be foundelizabeth could but just affect concern in	 2.8686390301148013
what he ever was	 2.878973900714998
work such a change as this it is impossible that he should still love	 2.648219377264469
cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea mrs collins	 2.5112301449029575
attempt to place him in an amiable light i am not equal to it wickham	 2.7810435992278633
her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her	 2.9866685502957027
form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or	 2.415161710642877
hope though you have but a short lease	 2.714678270265025

including obsolete old middleaged and new computers it exists	 2.620151981104675
another very welcome surprise for his chief wish at present was to	 2.2032567127812954
why should you be surprised my dear elizado you think it incredible	 3.0134381247604334
great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment	 3.9793736764368126
no want of subjectwe may compare our different opinions	 2.703252986976263
mr bennet replied that he had not	 3.5677396889648887
lydias voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open and	 3.3412356799503167

these	 3.7817533826612593
both had they appeared to be wrong she could no more explain such	 2.5111626285105744
there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her	 3.6607190252634605
do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right to be	 2.501567629852643
country	 3.8567066647275534
oh you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general	 2.860018715101264
hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was	 2.240155315365852

against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who	 2.844626194242345

have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from	 4.1643725715820565
jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her	 2.8783933966492885
to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect	 3.1195125248990667
their dear friends vulgar relations	 2.6735445303634964
ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at	 2.711644612015092

mistaken light have given you uneasiness i did not think mrs	 2.7204426147666845
mr wickhams adieus were much more affectionate than his wifes he	 2.6772120723335235
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really	 3.9400585117155993
you cannot be too much on your guard risk any thing rather than her	 3.249981289378793
most forbearing courtesy	 3.344580633228796

on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a few	 2.4661128033580333
evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to	 3.845741350246891
hereafter her own he had certainly formed such a plan and without	 2.300607121148376
lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to	 2.40158575145658
pleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers and though this	 2.793238195632656
the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane	 3.6011326192386073
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not now be sincere	 2.487102977852422
to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress for it might be found at	 3.8611695569204842
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it she immediately felt	 3.065834498809923
look into the park the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had	 2.589064854143748
she will never deserve to be happy what a meeting for her when she	 3.103801282330489
madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some	 3.1769102380111316
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings	 3.560203938841876
indeed mr bennet said she it is very hard to think that charlotte	 2.821672359842254
the scorn	 2.7434050868274498
contents i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink	 2.9697593680544907
i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected	 2.4255008500265767
better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth	 2.8476220871118327
day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late	 2.5120233321847807
of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter	 2.514077661267184
lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking	 3.346529820914115
though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady	 3.0228737251239384
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire about the court such	 3.046235199838789

as well to be silent only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth	 2.714977449579636
young ladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a	 2.4499500811812362
hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure lydia came to	 3.2281286625370895
that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet	 2.617428882357526
how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions	 2.6511954858361664
parsonage i should not think any one abiding in it an object of	 2.790654091481405
ever as he expressed them	 2.7747511486067467
assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were	 3.1910237945527506
research they may be modified and printed and given awayyou may do	 3.513400147837084
mrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state the very mention of any	 2.6407188622558784
since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love	 2.659312252091003
childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest	 2.862409491099727
walk and mr collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker	 3.066108039583585
pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true	 3.065466514852875
with mrs hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in	 2.703462316998119
from you very soon miss bingley said something of his never	 2.727140120370762

talking to bingley she looked at his two sisters and saw them making	 2.4906984290744503
to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account i often	 2.6847625084994915
extensive property	 2.20683721812523
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed	 3.2124583999741727
review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possible	 3.664846294021146
the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly	 2.4716541102514475
i am far from attributing any part of mr bingleys conduct to design	 2.5806880721434924
other they were not the only objects of mr collinss admiration the	 3.2403463732709366
generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told	 2.6249987212916603
very difficult my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to	 3.434198244700382
exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephews letter that	 3.785195951838391
an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it	 2.9382000695561716
wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of the sight of	 2.6686369232507787
had nobody to take care of her why did the forsters ever let her go out	 2.361109476595292
certainly not	 3.4463642705993545
supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough	 3.501063668638913
temper i ever met with i often tell my other girls they are nothing to	 2.1170298420567324
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however	 3.401490868315271
could think of nothing else and yet whether bingleys regard had really	 2.413011304941717
her eldest sister ah jane i take your place now and you must go	 2.441514713596593

fortune would make so very imprudent i have nothing to say against	 3.7814607868678007
spare you for another fortnight	 2.759476999353092
darcy had much better finish his letter	 2.992951325532694

her deference for his opinion	 3.7631111099997097
displeasure at this representation of them let it give you	 3.243883294324934

pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased	 2.8832393434379986
she smiled but made no answer he repeated the question with some	 2.447970024495117
that it ought not to be attempted mr darcy has not authorised me to	 4.180531465530809
age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to	 3.9639258140617355
her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist	 3.1915162322639294
mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily	 2.9299756752959727
she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was	 3.117234000995218
breeding but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to	 2.8647145743946343
which she chose to be insensible gaily continued oh mamma do the	 3.150371361345869

to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source	 3.252861887619201
it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with	 2.663852746894285
this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how	 2.814664768661385
had left her four thousand pounds	 2.585869924607986
was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either	 2.372528526787117
there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted	 3.06607489019173
what think you of this sentence my dear lizzysaid jane as she	 2.604435249548979
recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of	 4.600316177831067
and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be	 2.290422187192805

such an enormity at so early an age howsoever that may be you	 2.566670872847875

i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring i told you the other day	 3.0938349946420822

jane i congratulate you you will be a very happy woman	 3.4674089169738775
objectionable if they believed him attached to me they would not try	 2.6081333682592005
his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every	 2.4386570106264176

among his intimate acquaintance with them he is remarkably	 2.6511855773056503

all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding	 4.362041075599797
took place with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new	 2.3591258314125803

jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he	 3.1692183932735962
acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it were it known to the rest	 2.817619263006736

retaining mr bingley for his sister	 3.2537941501178027
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of	 2.876977603241821
in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and	 2.6921470841300628

as soon as ever mr bingley comes my dear said mrs bennet you	 2.722475868073583
understand	 3.802861811062019
disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to	 2.786612296580327
each of them and in the mean time she went after dinner to shew her	 2.858302929967775
tacit engagement with miss de bourgh are you lost to every feeling of	 2.548082720688168
claims of duty honour and gratitude you are determined to ruin him in	 2.735315361227085
herself was entirely insensible of the evil elizabeth had frequently	 3.225619782746779

elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not	 2.89704580683769
i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one but i always speak	 3.606974245780457

to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies	 4.597351032201582

that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy may i ask	 4.788689807849463

you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my	 2.6684071841371835

at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never	 3.3411078479144356

purpose to inquire after her mr darcy corroborated it with a bow and	 3.819633257934983
him capable of it	 3.51230098050278
her voice was weak and her manner affectedelizabeth was in agonies	 3.5925448924548786
elizabeth looked archly and turned away her resistance had not	 2.9221757168208193
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them	 3.3290018363355713
make way for her and live to see her take my place in it	 2.5755739441640317
dishonesty i must call it	 3.1324737476383775

calculation are heavy indeed but perhaps added he stopping in his	 3.0606053800007027
aunts where his regret and vexation and the concern of every body was	 2.9008957901538763

that is all settled repeated the other as she ran into her room to	 2.2731074603609165
was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said thanking her	 3.1237979151058295

the girls stared at their father mrs bennet said only nonsense	 2.432043732591801
to pemberley therefore they were to go	 2.9927044029062517
withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which	 3.104980110654215
rosings a lively imagination soon settled it all	 2.5335367859813753

you never see a fault in any body all the world are good and agreeable	 2.8463745118255925
i am sure why janeyou never dropt a word of this you sly thing	 2.5055542685003345
inquiries on the same subject of bingley jane met her with a smile of	 2.7534790474925295
and blushed again with shame and vexation she could not help frequently	 3.850609880265688
foolish things that were said in the morning and yet upon my honour i	 2.5500935765507813

your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of	 2.4086972802571456
when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i	 2.6400884837303016
remember it myself	 3.129768071098865
engaged with mr darcy that they scarcely ever saw him i found that	 2.621687339272844
gentleman had called on business on saturday he came again your	 2.291311022169182
measure to his kindness we are persuaded that he has pledged himself	 2.9648067544778014
gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her	 4.682798379461242
him he now wished it more than ever had he done his duty in that	 2.196005419887829
but darcy was clever he was at the same time haughty reserved and	 3.6004183172245203
spot mr denny addressed them directly and entreated permission to	 2.286385099978324
an application to her nephew and how he might take a similar	 2.3809069673991483
you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your	 2.658876968922822
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it	 2.8955780042706016
mama cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and captain	 2.472613499244754
condescension arose to receive them and as mrs collins had settled it	 2.7700923291202497
detained first by the civility of mr collins whose inquiries after	 2.774622825614422
part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree	 2.4855016510238506
imaginary but still he would be her husbandwithout thinking highly	 2.3993205931715087
attention to the imperfection of the performance when you told mrs	 4.183814618227162
she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road	 3.496609694837954
an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr	 3.4226685581354737

other reply to elizabeths salutation than a slight inclination of the	 2.478879638703757
late to be saving mrs bennet had no turn for economy and her	 3.9293004391814055
intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither	 2.923229844518222
i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and tell the	 3.1614750764100394
you keep winking at me for what am i to do	 2.379799009427451
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had	 2.6306738991348118
always within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or the	 3.649779517269157
unable to sit alone mary was obliged to mix more with the world but	 2.6083006076940243

would rather have cried her father had most cruelly mortified her by	 3.516028290320753
can you deny that you have done it she repeated	 3.1948754421552255
elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the	 3.624627896655607
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting it would surely be much	 3.2272361831082708
elopement i know it all that the young mans marrying her was a	 2.9849497665665057

opposite the front of his house it was a handsome modern building well	 3.2595373228068265

in your eyes i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life	 2.8737195329465335
it it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence	 3.901969600226164
to mr darcy it was welcome intelligenceelizabeth had been at	 3.413137857466246
had been valued by his friend here was knowledge in which no one could	 2.9744911665097633
openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be	 2.5525197295908155
said mrs bennet to her husband and all the others equally well	 3.4596508787778615
delight but we considered it we talked of it as impossible and do you	 2.457887161876731
rosings	 3.7857628190118695
militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship	 2.977117649106285
bennet was not so well pleased with it lydias being settled in the	 2.7934940285942056
own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to	 2.844945223663541
yesthat is what makes it amusing had they fixed on any other man	 2.735521537718468
enough each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their	 2.5447167318795616
pemberley was now georgianas home and the attachment of the sisters	 2.672062152307158

credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the	 2.788805531708804

listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she	 2.583664561199429
deal counteracted by the selfconceit of a weak head living in	 3.408094225895928
joy	 3.865033581992048
then after a short silence he continued lizzy i bear you no	 2.4231693109626002
was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one	 3.5268883446041754
ill	 3.838746998837587
i can readily believe answered he gravely that report may vary	 2.4184493736985706

not for the entail i should not mind it	 4.525041332342664

late mr darcys steward let me recommend you however as a friend	 2.7423750780729685
hope it why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the	 2.9082198330754236

lydias intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten every sister	 2.436359512263605
third time i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just	 2.8233269427044645
not that you are an adept in the science yourself mr darcy	 3.476403366957211
means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and	 3.0677947579470524
aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she	 3.8447580469617693
mr bennets emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such	 3.0502605185798277
as mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she	 2.744116819268389
as i canor perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away	 3.0115000142585187
misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the	 3.5403846452020216
about	 3.4454138760707362
has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has	 2.542276332680215
kindness on a more grateful object	 2.620563541151765
i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she your	 3.1952284184012267
reflections is a very common failing i believe by all that i have	 3.2256506986462252
girls had been on the point of marriage and after all there was nothing	 2.7683221383839083
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would	 2.608004177571463
and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least	 3.131419241878553
his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bennet his marriage was	 2.879950260855804
compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an	 3.690149111978657
be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done	 3.9018854161954293
that mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn	 2.7631351414144527
yes it has often led him to be liberal and generousto give his	 3.4812093960204322
myself and of mr wickham too he shall not be in love with me if i	 3.1666249080593882
again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to	 2.8615126810555616
than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring	 3.0545475930010597
a conceited pompous narrowminded silly man you know he is as well	 3.0693645629155757
tell me once for all are you engaged to him	 2.3830003408244425
conceal from her his share in lydias marriage all was acknowledged	 2.256053564015199
you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less	 4.598877136805511
tomorrow evening in such an exigence my uncles advice and	 2.78885383182824

the case and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed	 2.676063711354665

my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the	 4.670558825519517
living i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her	 3.2989490569006814
upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of	 3.291847887934892
the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be	 2.4034309805006164

probable consequence of her allusions to mr wickham and rejoiced in	 4.885171376202137
but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so ill of	 2.432201109716361
without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now	 3.7280125233238093

reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her	 2.5556729257836617
i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her	 2.650113158164265
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the	 2.678311272460476

that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure that	 2.6377198839908242

i have not already heard give me farther particulars what did colonel	 2.252563416207148
very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so	 3.1920082606884645
others and between her and mrs gardiner with occasional help from	 2.853149862680843
otherabout eight years ago	 2.765726643359304
me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying	 2.9400414610737924
offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs collins and myself on	 2.746855929496711
manoeuvre of mrs bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of	 3.511503246659682
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness	 2.3572187384617966
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentlemans	 2.4309454773999075
agreeable but elizabeth less clearsighted perhaps in his case than	 2.3173448001939794
elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great	 3.247278301960784
people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance	 2.5208771580420635
what he said of mr darcys indifference and she could do nothing but	 2.8334968313879023
strikingly alteredwhat could it mean that he should even speak to	 2.576866580558868
treat in such a manner the godson the friend the favourite of his	 2.9363063972941106
situation and temper consider mr collinss respectability and	 2.6945202494839378
little information and uncertain temper when she was discontented she	 2.9214122204744495
would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men he took leave	 3.113261235635539
did whether he would think it proper to join in the evenings	 2.716145553345475
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the	 3.478481183102602
preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right	 3.255705859308199
without constant practice i have told miss bennet several times that	 2.741552410912833
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer	 3.652768216778422
brittle than it is beautifuland that she cannot be too much guarded	 3.61700750323493
about pretty much for my part i am inclined to believe it all mr	 2.9738390190649198
be for one of them sir william and lady lucas are determined to go	 2.9245014910130163
would not listen therefore to her daughters proposal of being carried	 2.986907609627399
well lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so the	 2.4033740454138224
rosings rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must wait	 3.8413005051622444
mr gardiner whose manners were easy and pleasant encouraged her	 2.364103406138775
first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would	 3.512312598532721
cookery was owing but here he was set right by mrs bennet who assured	 2.5845515791749665
i see no occasion for that you and the girls may go or you may send	 2.3911118121259594
from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young	 2.8360002198885357
redistribution	 1.9905095457977273
evident enough	 3.3877884040034774
consequence to begin the acquaintancemr collins listened to her	 2.5043938021854855
mrs bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such	 3.3590065263450617
went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and	 2.720112350894977
you began the evening well charlotte said mrs bennet with civil	 2.690177467249537
her not objecting does not justify him it only shews her being	 3.5162276777360555
chapter xxii	 1.9484968389608204
scarcely give them a hearing they were ignorant idle and vain while	 2.2356251903297037
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and	 2.3524674891972204
first you may remember	 2.841037847038018
glowing with the warmth of exercise	 3.2570363118342676
called out	 3.4148133949855115
what jane felt for bingley her astonishment at his comingat his	 2.7626316427084405
i suspected as much replied elizabeth but how did he account for	 2.592449636768627
assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be	 3.348448284139582
to protect the project gutenbergtm mission of promoting the free	 4.428702840227198
habit of saying made no mention of the business that had taken him	 2.292429595134241
oh cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way	 3.9903705601522237
and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage	 2.9346067435857153
colour it was many months since she had mentioned his name to	 2.3395742619215554
they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his	 3.060739159091537
much more than to any other person in the room	 3.137563473123389
looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for darcy to leave her	 2.8166275808500956
and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after	 2.773742804154938
actually married you cannot greatly err you must write again very	 2.794467937756378
was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth when they	 2.9410432313735333
astonished her husband and daughters	 3.0594596373130165
may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before at present i will	 2.561567682133093
gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved	 3.212639994680139
i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility mr darcy would	 2.8734388758650233
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great she knew not how to	 3.011597515856839
i am not	 3.35250877798137
may i ask to what these questions tend	 2.433161584737708
acquaintance are connected wickham passed all his youth there you	 2.7357194057975485
from their own feelings and his servants report without any reference	 2.518402451640802
less his son might have borne with me better but his fathers uncommon	 2.766793683763397
might not unreasonably have alarmed her she had dressed with more than	 4.198141204871674
the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would	 2.6914604791649914
with others of the officers at longbourn and so little was elizabeth	 2.7408914622988036
seemed a gulf impassable between them had lydias marriage been	 3.35771506571369

housekeeping i dare say	 3.3235391420208193
ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject mr	 2.5863303046756334
why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that	 3.370914374733841
some minutes in silence and at last on the young ladys whispering	 2.660912138930134
but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be	 2.755796761340818
mutual desire of never meeting again	 2.5753314683925015
why my dear you must know mrs long says that netherfield is taken	 2.5279663254367337
such recollection befriended her she could see him instantly before	 3.000168817313897
she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup	 3.2739181404864732
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations	 2.9645393040955135
coarseness of expression herself the coarseness of the sentiment	 3.22183385803682
himself at her feet he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins	 3.111091960461127
uncivil she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all	 2.476882835341971
of threadbare morality to listen to catherine and lydia had	 3.5125248757663976
friend had any intention of making one in the croud but of that i	 3.2479566563478444
opinion my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light	 2.792332032603402
up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks	 3.3661933704021205
but you do not know all i will read you the passage which	 3.410410175760654
she be as tall as i am	 3.302850095531732
round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and	 3.0055834378676796
since we see every day that where there is affection young people are	 2.2226909824905094
answered this description when mr hurst called them to order with	 2.9632229729445694
the rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of mrs forster	 3.296013290354333
might possibly get a settled family there but perhaps mr bingley did	 2.2698594321157186
elizabeths congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a	 3.853066281396741
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared	 2.5392940320857735
discover it too	 3.0338754749908765
she is happy then said her father drily and her residence there	 3.335437669786384

elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for	 2.6832059565516815
him replied the other elizabeth thought this was going pretty far	 2.3258626278263264
unconcern oh but there were two or three much uglier in the shop and	 3.2223041970051955
library	 3.7871963782096243
of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the	 3.046439824545671
outstrip them they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy	 2.569568842041488
through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving mr	 3.0031150209097017
enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word	 3.5365195888278556
are not worth a regret come let me see the list of the pitiful fellows	 2.84205284450306
when mr bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual	 2.80299541127644
leave to say very impolitic toofor it is provoking me to retaliate	 4.650459380291613
design of engaging my affection it is only that he is blessed with	 3.2833378130873316
come to hunsford	 3.3476325851305204
been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way i wonder who first	 2.7700662714771394
humoured lively and i never saw such happy mannersso much ease	 2.6017165505526076
was at netherfield i hope your plans in favour of the shire will	 2.6301639791805185
for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a great	 2.8923330150869195
her when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy who took	 2.8260887412916933
my dear dear lydia she cried this is delightful indeedshe will	 2.5857087796372173
to improve myself for in my situation of life mrs philips was	 2.498847125492952
seek to clear one without involving the other	 3.0138742673351424
once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own till the next	 2.47808699905353
fancy the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers she	 3.703519435337644
suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight	 2.959947315095317
assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to	 3.6341594693789996
unreasonable but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity	 4.5380439526151415
darcy only entered the room	 3.049572090040319
daughter	 3.8254984375551118
on reaching the house they were shewn through the hall into the saloon	 3.389297965871616
to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mothers ungracious and	 2.661841780616165
very proudas a child she was affectionate and pleasing and	 2.3976414399612485
could	 3.6851505277111025
delight which words could but poorly express every sentence of	 2.325144260916997

her equally avoid the name of his friend but now she would no longer	 2.556299443797248
treated you too and then when we came away it was such fun i thought	 2.5738817892174124
not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to	 2.6116267153275734
was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased	 2.405497918511295
that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be	 2.926012505958838
pause added	 3.3336019715068526
the world perhaps other people have said so before but not one	 2.2521960775678247
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen	 3.0769890186388618
revolted in his offer to herself what will be his surprise thought	 2.4211354584988167
and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of	 3.049320308081201
exaggeration the shocking rudeness of mr darcy	 3.7649678795434465
ceased speaking replied thus	 2.80034741370313
principal object he was then he said on his way to longbourn on	 2.3910626184286574
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners	 2.754075323885229
much said her aunt a place too with which so many of your	 2.4033917971582093

but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation	 2.535553329945405
elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour at	 2.294525472805992

talking over their route the evening before mrs gardiner expressed an	 2.753756912003155
can have no great inclination for talking nobody can tell what i	 2.4000216662352467
we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure	 3.1027857232232416
in parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer	 4.219304783001246
it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession	 2.6772441986707567
when miss de bourgh comes in	 3.046002774529919
produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched	 3.8555990645259253
it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth the	 2.8042744197248894
wickhams attentions there could be no conversation in the noise of	 2.858632738943351
these visits she examined into their employments looked at their work	 2.8292652079559732
you would have spoken if i had not asked you my resolution of	 2.749049935132733
when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to	 2.4240543056381
depended less on any single event or any particular person for though	 2.2572854261898234
nothing can be done i know very well that nothing can be done how is	 2.4030382738467844
heard his claims on mr darcy and all that he had suffered from him	 4.2503399402054844
though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in	 3.2409864035054854
where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has	 2.513778466305101
written explanation to the person you received the work from if you	 2.9616941740190152
believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such	 3.26678646173785
i will make no promise of the kind	 2.5345830371170486
thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect too	 2.2450531358285395
elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer than	 2.6721891210313307
williams allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his	 4.306514109065173
leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded	 3.1083013424669828
more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account	 2.7940164259729987
supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which	 3.419292283056654
implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who	 2.50197317152223
wickhamyour sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a	 2.286459870132604

one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other	 3.3662868762211997
her age and disposition greater steadiness than first attachments often	 2.390511538322119
in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a	 2.8528322495910734
with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling your	 2.619540590564517

mrs gardiner abused her stupidity if it were merely a fine house	 3.054979826716547
expressed her fears of miss de bourghs being too hot or too cold or	 2.8734840208782937
good kind brotheri knew how it would bei knew he would manage	 2.8505132051847974
elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with	 2.489464741135697
