pardon for having displeased her in a softened tone she declared	 278.716302908168
of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express	 770.8432266950385
what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the	 103.0796693379453

a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by	 674.5267802473683
my dear mr bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard that	 360.40949144661005

about its relative situation let our first effusions be less	 1358.9092134986827

her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana	 42.36309657793422
but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that	 127.68529164462221
little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the	 64.64423317468183
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from	 63.28640958320151
such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to	 223.13076758726194
she admired him	 4.686298239453644
wickhams affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to	 672.1633300641457

suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly to	 420.1540614798717
this was a sad omen of what her mothers behaviour to the gentleman	 49.26202570407272

darcys opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and	 159.1672460510239
that you certainly shall	 89.87205363828039
yes i do comprehend a great deal in it	 60.32307729348317
elizabeths spirits were so high on the occasion that though she did	 246.70695338046178
back a supply of clothes	 1985.6228672788466
in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow	 41.19569920146474

her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas	 375.99796993403334

his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many	 134.14692734002017
it is enough to know they are discovered i have seen them	 199.8936377225178
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion at that instant she felt	 30.00866730030721

ready to think your own children silly if i wished to think slightingly	 431.2538036817513
she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages	 100.20815499736328
true it will be wise in me to refrain from that but do not imagine	 278.4674953845012
symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the	 143.53649709681443
them ill	 117.04758309338195

and anxious attention while she added	 134.0111293169398
you write uncommonly fast	 108.6157269101597
quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr darcy	 34.70010687505747
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience	 64.49191060817516
is nothing like dancing after alli consider it as one of the first	 198.1540783738676

resentments of his having an unforgiving temper his disposition must	 303.38973661877003
disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate there	 101.25605242448258
kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours	 422.43299947492227
were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy	 918.7911093431542

them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report	 333.19880778382253
elizabeth asked questions in vain maria would tell her nothing more	 427.71276842691515
there was certainly at this moment in elizabeths mind a more gentle	 424.6501594701132
being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud	 395.483188412294
had a great deal of talk together they met again on sunday and	 319.4135069003696
hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the rest of	 444.8533245595379
many girls and what sort of young lady is she is she handsome	 1944.4325801817868
engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many	 729.893789136152

how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the	 315.1551301338412

no no you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i	 911.8388728732873
greatness before him and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh	 90.68603524068509
mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of	 62.71478107776114

of usual cheerfulness but with no farther attempt to distinguish	 392.2831122904201
lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr darcy drawing near	 951.512993345184
and trust he will excuse my not having done it before my total	 446.8419343779172

should make their appearance at st jamess the whole family in short	 381.96949904681264
there with his friends permission or being bold enough to come	 996.1484520700068
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could very	 413.0828106747614
relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sisters	 342.544566216155

enquiries which she very early received from mr bingley by a housemaid	 297.1818504377606
on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the	 11.598631981629085

particulars but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to	 95.38654953710055
i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his	 449.1298399691921
with it and was confident at last that she recollected having heard	 140.0977937274829
income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in	 42.86102789326052
gracefully elizabeth went away with her head full of him she could	 364.0128990807297

such boundless influence that he had been concerned in the measures	 42.33457807986042
minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to	 87.79203067299318

his sisters would be successful in keeping him away unwilling as she	 171.94660269168125
perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had	 271.8575381989455
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she	 912.5341626135585
an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to	 730.7452876825706
always exceed your income	 17.041206810098053
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and	 40.3530071865255
but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her	 97.97895677224975
turned away with a degree of ill humour which she could not wholly	 193.9749783411184
discover them but he had something to direct his search which was	 70.05243732175985
thought it would be very good fun if i was	 14.459859477911468
darcy it was a rational scheme to be sure but from what the report of	 564.0381599527373
easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance she was very	 335.36742766884464
aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable	 357.23657557009665
having somebody at his disposal i wonder he does not marry to secure a	 222.15850603632558
seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent	 1656.6212984761182
the country said darcy can in general supply but few subjects for	 520.1817446198962
work you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1e<NUMBER>	 98.42690754598468
written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by mr darcy	 595.094147525403
there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the	 176.50630086317443
make an offer to me	 138.6278225981033
were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined	 91.27948752311157
and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and	 292.70514778973455
possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every	 136.64489643136918
of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some	 183.8473443074426
your examination of mr darcy is over i presume said miss	 57.85442700484077
in the diningroom they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been	 127.00984377806996
she had condemned and upbraided him her anger was turned against	 139.02245617631436
were speaking of just now	 283.2002613083475
i did not know before that you ever walked this way	 47.575133676644676
pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the	 371.8881042977392
taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes	 1532.3843821343853
the possibility of mr collinss fancying himself in love with her	 106.60441640899741
accept the honour of their invitation c mrs bennet was quite	 927.29875659437
colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of	 263.6373419997062
then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added	 148.57233813964132
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added how long did you	 170.0205722979275
make a most important discovery	 21.40698900030002
must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was	 133.39133790434306
unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimed	 10.33505832760409
fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as	 1807.4697417046054
i hope my dear said mr bennet to his wife as they were at	 47.18791271490491
you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this i see	 114.62591465496394
confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running up	 103.24158576814969
civilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a	 168.24037330496301
various creditors of mr wickham in and near brighton with	 97.33012661701962
many months ago from mr wickham on this subject what can you have to	 1071.05591829209
charms	 1.9905095457977273
your first position is false they may wish many things besides his	 422.9867436473324
these are not janes feelings she is not acting by design as yet she	 532.8989976452152
weighty accusation of having injured mr wickham i can only	 38.10370618057944
and completely do for us at once good heaven brighton and a whole	 591.2623676650627
done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlottes	 247.20821114746948
might in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbers	 555.1193248725691
philosophic composure he said as little as he had ever been in the	 137.21953245621017
be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of	 144.72048002629458
lady catherine how wonderfully these sort of things occur who would	 490.52872921208433
some who are able and willing to assist him in the army he has the	 117.18866518240306
but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their own	 135.35439645776643
darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for	 92.25100947905948
satisfy mr collins and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyships	 422.54164171244156
only once with mrs hurst and once with miss bingley declined being	 447.494766362611
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said	 648.7130458509683
mentioned colonel fitzwilliams and mr darcys having both spent three	 1081.2119698527488
mr darcy who was leaning against the mantlepiece with his eyes fixed	 56.04169813226534
neglect such an acquaintance well how pleased i am and it is such a	 164.0240616922811
being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured	 154.7192130794165
elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol	 27.802845759786894
making any answer she went on as before	 535.3884749889019
they would not offer to send her home	 630.2827864347121
monday endurable to kitty and lydia	 28.90326028466912
myself how can you be so teazing	 32.11388757772448
they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to	 134.25307815922184
end without a quarrel come as soon as you can on the receipt of	 428.55826170654973
without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable	 226.91989745577428
receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost	 721.0372793272552
elizabeth looked surprised the gentleman experienced some change of	 428.4111132267503
yourself and mrs bennet i am inclined to think that her own	 37.720439425657304
opportunities to fix the problem	 3.0751718520068345
fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was	 198.49551676514568
when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which	 413.65615172444404
had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as	 976.1530168720408
importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience	 178.32205828917216
learnt to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted her	 616.433447496911
not speak another word darcy in wretched suspense could only say	 766.1872760715424
elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the	 155.0816302699422
was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil but i have	 113.66106905729063
begin freelya slight preference is natural enough but there are	 2411.265001276223
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a	 759.8232589629429
ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself she	 1442.1124947657072
bingleys regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence	 37.00738779818906
i saw you look at me today lizzy when my aunt told us of the present	 548.5264068661301
your uncle has laid down to bring it about and the other how i am	 850.7067717369624
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at	 92.09822052787729
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour	 67.8649612707361
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests darcy said	 620.9309449132378
considering the event shews some greatness of mind	 79.47073387379216
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence	 360.81911219292346
very well we now come to the point your mother insists upon your	 488.84217311888324
i have not a doubt of mr bingleys sincerity said elizabeth warmly	 21.32279510880884
of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so	 832.4886573985704
conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself	 22.594186482628153
experienced many hardships of that nature but in matters of greater	 89.95264634091203

persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering	 117.09018218243564
charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her	 467.0430911522246

yes all of them i think they all paint tables cover skreens and net	 73.39202890029588
preference which was often given me	 81.16986929775027
that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be	 304.87325694564544
has often said so and envied me janes beauty i do not like to boast	 503.68213262094633
animal spirits and a sort of natural selfconsequence which the	 264.42715699046863
being soon married her joy burst forth and every following sentence	 1508.3458361774485
good and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered	 313.1346942643532
wife but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true	 384.1340870268212
yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight do	 610.4422200874886
marry you but when you have had time to think it all over i hope you	 485.7533980204144
was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have	 425.56347205655203
wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of	 450.6136189346075
before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the	 54.09519652722431
good good news to my sister philips and as i come back i can call on	 1535.9710093916017
temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydias example she	 449.55742687741247
her which he could not help flattering himself however might be	 75.93114166045739
arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe	 54.71273824899009
must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget	 993.1689062171627
certainly sirand it has the advantage also of being in vogue	 390.58109915007327
it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon	 543.1304755013507
is this thought elizabeth meant for me and she coloured at the	 235.33436646229035
lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added	 191.39256725115428
out like his information	 331.91391654612966
mr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunts ill breeding and made	 347.19412878657334
always very short those to her mother contained little else than that	 933.8259066519233
own words so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to	 445.55813871021763
reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon	 157.35912755033647
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you	 89.93267810779683
the exertion would soon have been nothing one ought not to	 260.4837961187691
therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that	 704.3995902649101
humility it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an	 631.6024619031577
