a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side	 40.00204439902915
the neighbourhood	 3.8826007956328277
elizabeth on her side had much to do she wanted to ascertain the	 301.974180372712
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement there are a few	 201.58818516126377
oh jane cried elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it who	 1254.270792986535
or charges if you are redistributing or providing access to a work	 73.26006931468157
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as	 949.6764109992484
body too who is likely to know	 306.3485046338289
was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one	 1346.548648185043
provided in paragraph 1f3 you agree that the foundation the	 15.78399670988905
confirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of what	 6.919155912191821
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe how can you be smiling so	 44.75884133286311
politeness there was good humour and kindnessmr darcy said very	 1179.1156625205824
a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by	 670.9924070278563
minutes in which they continued together were some of the most	 263.7083649216111
only fond of this young mans society whose manners were always	 1225.6532564975091

otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a skreen but i am very	 16.773285406812988
her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who	 530.4876191041963
cost sir lewis de bourgh	 8.720860834178904
extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her	 354.5479587110582
far as to exclude me from p i shall never be quite happy till i	 115.0137196421214
they have been intended for each other it was the favourite wish of	 442.2436019005155
him was ecstacy	 13.226413193330096
merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he	 981.73139648855
their party in the diningroom was large for almost all the lucases	 250.2762029303576
had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with	 437.66304246631677
his regiment at the end of a fortnight	 77.40820112743498
would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone elizabeth blushed	 224.53792796586433
could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other	 135.85229107056074
representation of all this might make me quite easy but i know the	 260.87787346179334
mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisters proficiency	 164.2310756635284
you begin said she i can comprehend your going on charmingly when	 232.95129355952824
they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was	 159.0840208085227
disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some	 501.63555121212545
jane looked at her doubtingly oh lizzy it cannot be i know how much	 283.0324447829773
unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it	 87.84872220181512
astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of	 518.3849419105195
a beautyi should as soon call her mother a wit but afterwards she	 1211.1943770701553
for good news the letter was read aloud mrs bennet could hardly	 409.45631539745403
there were other evils before her she anticipated what would be felt in	 97.49645980706339
objection all loveliness and goodness as she is her understanding	 43.90756119692798
circumstances	 246.0178898202374
my frankness to believe me capable of that after abusing you so	 165.1506362117292
with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not	 291.5516150532965
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours	 596.8315310619273
agreeable he would have talked to mrs long but i can guess how it was	 505.9634663714947
all took place miss bingleys civility to elizabeth increased at last	 515.3291054270651
the charge of her but i was overruled as i always am poor dear	 470.7324244834456
attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause	 905.7927604445823
laugh as much as you chuse but you will not laugh me out of my	 481.8116571957528
spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as	 30.49984199882864
and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of	 525.0444637816729
otherwise explained	 55.59998689873995
that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from	 641.9026317227691
retailing them all to the younger miss lucases and lydia in a voice	 239.50495898586408
seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much	 279.02125900474584
those points where he most wants care from something that he told me in	 1449.8214233374074
door he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to any one else	 703.4767715392561
meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country let wickham	 155.475489482043
at netherfield at last she did indeed i do think mrs long is as good	 699.0512014718413
well thensupposing them to be in london they may be there though	 195.0209618976153
elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this	 87.54121403411295
upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get	 278.86116871677586
report is spread abroad	 65.48056140185484
that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the	 797.1866242357307
independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in	 70.67998913847545
good natured a girl as ever lived i will go directly to mr bennet and	 402.4377505948895
it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your	 211.21051186155225
stronglymarked features which might once have been handsome her air	 304.93620767168784
where a few books were lying he immediately offered to fetch her	 217.27300710205878
who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an	 2072.679860398784
waterplant there chanced to be a little alteration it originated in	 27.323264977600665
i hope added mrs gardiner that no consideration with regard to	 570.5934399869584
confusion lest they had been overheard	 6.181834420247453
playful disposition which delighted in any thing ridiculous	 162.6614972978765
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew	 255.4908163742009
prove what she felt	 15.146950438583286
rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning there was a	 180.63262010402306
to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certain true he	 344.0442562405592
why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she	 785.8095192338368
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy and	 115.42214572477317
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother	 33.53426192424366
them in the course of the day but mrs bennet who had calculated on	 28.538377674132022
copying and distributing project gutenbergtm electronic works to	 27.788707530952745
wished to learn never wanted the means we were always encouraged to	 215.9198821597982
elizabeth shook her head over this letter it convinced her that	 238.05281676170233
1813	 2.0190770273117145
in general satisfactory mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor	 326.1128734733021
continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the groupand i doubt	 1016.6141950176627
section 1 general terms of use and redistributing project gutenbergtm	 83.61568607611595
in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to	 13.998594608805245
which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the	 641.70980060769
great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen	 315.592757154755
by all means my good qualities are under your protection and you are	 91.94976956841987
successful love for mrs bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule	 186.75813768462788
i believe she didand i am sure she could not have bestowed her	 32.66605231113861
not for the entail i should not mind it	 37.66034572547317
they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the	 484.97263277234873
the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one	 913.6217760850101
to a milliners shop just over the way the two youngest of the family	 101.35112596444732
spoke she would have quitted the room had not mr collins thus	 529.1688165630234
assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be	 162.84655126381048
influencing his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been	 511.137196966494
siryou will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching	 149.43637790694663
events mr wickham wrote to inform me that having finally	 230.30508882992345
janes steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable	 384.37783324580965
some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn	 131.16634832777024
with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling your	 443.77017246664303
were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his	 424.9008242835294
year letters of business too how odious i should think them	 1460.464340126967
useless for of course they were to have a son this son was to join	 408.7016091828293
parsonage i should not think any one abiding in it an object of	 313.36509018047263
idea of an accomplished woman	 60.83803998632538
were particularly intimate sir william lucas had been formerly in trade	 94.64259176249008
her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been	 946.5338631293149
except thought elizabeth when she goes to ramsgate	 74.317458679152
had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty	 155.27640927771836
sake turning to charlotte i am glad of it but otherwise i see no	 1187.7289776834793
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with	 537.2776371506077
consequent explanations	 2.2759724581815157
in spite of having been at st jamess sir william was so completely	 137.78823689143084
delight but we considered it we talked of it as impossible and do you	 593.0652718732329
supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which	 89.64958657167601
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready	 1272.8308918571643
seeing him till after the departure of the former he did not	 145.39445174178155
sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeableallowing	 13.065689200632121
coming here i had no notion but he would go a shooting or something or	 474.3252620985232
thing she ever did she seems perfectly happy however and in a	 446.5322550967927
scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under	 305.0319204428452
were indisposed maria thought speaking out of the question and the	 355.9677992557648
could from such disgraceful companions that he was surprised by the	 154.416317497345
would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november	 423.86815868737494
soon after this event	 76.03943633411993
derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world	 316.86253811341953
reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own	 699.0579254702768
but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow if i can	 509.2433404890328
cambric and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders had	 197.38590412400296
place as soon as possible which he trusted would be an unanswerable	 163.850470051807
how strange cried elizabeth how abominablei wonder that the very	 405.741567837646
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing	 147.28425767239605
mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of	 110.65265240979494
setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again	 387.21917215821037
a conceited pompous narrowminded silly man you know he is as well	 208.4488260230953
apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments	 159.85395732069793
should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but	 286.8591705004122
but self though it would intrude could not engross her lydiathe	 57.86772414877469
he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while	 567.3816967979683
returning to the carriage as quickly as possible her niece was	 283.8518786950279
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield the visit	 459.5076804747796
aye that is just like your formality and discretion you thought the	 187.84920569173124
what jane felt for bingley her astonishment at his comingat his	 334.7044821962699
alarms being now removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of	 87.94166337003969
down stairs herself on entering the drawingroom she found the whole	 315.0608629115172
with such justice i am happier even than jane she only smiles i	 677.1030967710566
such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than mrs	 104.07775185314989
sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth	 355.6482933519496
opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song	 68.2623757895866
must deaden them more mr darcys behaviour astonished and vexed her	 142.32851808552914
trademark owner and any distributor under this agreement will not be	 60.008072528534264
last incumbrance of mystery and then said she if that very	 115.90185551803668
think necessary and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with	 427.83866836191396
his reliance on mine made every thing easy i was obliged to confess	 1662.5149686423447
to london i was right therefore my last letter had never reached her	 1385.9647092342964
she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the	 258.08133308362784
at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of	 172.94557185109898
tired and they stood together on the lawn at such a time much might	 106.45960020378246
this was a lucky idea of mine indeed said mrs bennet more than	 390.19327898027
with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to	 818.4467253110919
sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks though her manner	 895.9413850407572
as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in	 287.3022753422956
had gained their own room jane taking out the letter said	 382.7622187995647
were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers	 110.99241439380148
attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation	 130.44972580705812
welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble	 38.673904363159046
till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him	 43.12577071062318
drew back and said with some discomposure to sir william	 155.80531478095935
i have heard much of your masters fine person said mrs gardiner	 86.42594350417393
invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had	 128.16867165176632
agreeable but elizabeth less clearsighted perhaps in his case than	 1355.0104675975365
i am far from attributing any part of mr bingleys conduct to design	 265.61395373502944
decease is all that you may ever be entitled to on that head	 237.09638977311445
one i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady	 203.12756590511268
pay	 2.0190770273117145
known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love	 1553.3299549331898
animated mrs collins knew not what to make of him colonel	 296.439728002159
on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost	 606.1070057610517
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run	 98.1562691616136
took place	 17.6818800275476
sir william remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelings	 410.95249411663224
individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor	 101.5885678525442
my part mr bingley i always keep servants that can do their own	 829.2607843265939
connected with the letter he held it suddenly struck her that it might	 482.28711156956854
of her life	 15.938546124899133
mr bingley followed his advice mr darcy walked off and elizabeth	 413.74857730491385
possible that he will marry her	 124.0437618617792
however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively	 825.3558341262749
chance in the world of her ever getting him now there is no talk of his	 760.2955030519843
fastidious and his manners though well bred were not inviting in	 75.05343480004305
brother gardiners in town so much in love with her that my	 116.32381651214428
for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he	 637.7097230803723
them as instruction but i will no longer importune my young cousin	 406.00316998841726
time make their past imprudence forgotten	 773.2342469790945
to driving him out in his gig and shewing him the country but when he	 123.46023055316181
intention but mr darcy chose to doubt itor to treat it as a merely	 672.7649623684026
what he was had i but explained some part of it onlysome part of what	 263.3853730760521
strange	 2.0190770273117145
when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject it	 2034.6290249758183
objected to be kept waiting for her dinnersuch formidable accounts of	 21.174630356259872
have been quite a slave to your education	 86.92854888913747
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little	 762.6208533145889
what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of every thing	 103.12790711420651
little except in a low voice to mrs jenkinson in whose appearance	 346.56880954528924

her which he could not help flattering himself however might be	 75.8219936360504

instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the	 380.2955064647123
temper she could not contribute much to my felicity	 424.3143858346681

you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first	 762.0724339820893

my dearest love tell me what dish mr darcy is particularly fond of	 386.79185293399865
drawingroom and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decent	 241.46331555910882
and she would at times have given any thing to be privileged to tell	 117.001336799216
acquaintance	 3.7745753465094447
must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them	 130.47245686745325
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but	 794.6949716376732
if he does not come to me then said she i shall give him up for	 299.24566330012414
first circles allow me to say however that your fair partner does not	 474.4662043407519
deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the power of	 276.35594711857624

assure you it is much larger than sir william lucass	 92.64243119687663

went to see him he should marry one of my daughters but it ended in	 493.8605514010373
neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we	 862.7006854131289

shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness lady	 96.31439472973155
she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me and i am in no	 164.43452675217534

conversation with the ladies and sir william to elizabeths high	 557.585216456844
for heavens sake madam speak lowerwhat advantage can it be to you	 396.52543904410425

would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour	 200.42829796020146
while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the	 31.707113171814786
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless	 326.02851398330415
that it ought not to be attempted mr darcy has not authorised me to	 38.596380778410236
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when	 143.51829623997324
wickham immediately to elizabeths mind and from the observation of the	 477.72504087390604
with while sir william was with them mr collins devoted his mornings	 206.94053940554943
i do assure you sir that i have no pretension whatever to that kind	 285.16140347638793
herselfthat could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost	 458.017455528392
rather taller	 4.017372072497316
mr collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he	 416.29759633400255
memories than that their brothers fortune and their own had been	 382.65915226197353
seen riding down the street on distinguishing the ladies of the group	 55.125473968162986
i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy	 642.7988337753869
elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to	 233.84306236154583
they had never seen before of most gentlemanlike appearance walking	 399.9595512809527
been in an error your superior knowledge of your sister must make	 348.3594036027484
staid so long that even bingleys good humour was overcome and he	 232.25712419162514
inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such	 86.48569322329509
every moment should be employed in conversing together jane should	 381.99261059616504
and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be	 1163.7835277384434
could be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they	 325.3392648591651
looked at jane and smiled and shook her head by turns	 245.75970526671637
we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire	 217.30169545755982
can have induced him to behave so cruelly	 19.651274169495494
to such perseverance in wilful selfdeception elizabeth would make no	 181.85547081018578
character and ideas between us we seem to have been designed for each	 283.9929782979098
amongst the less polished societies of the worldevery savage can	 61.68273175745392
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects but when they see	 179.98045438638292
depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both	 107.81258929351169
better looking it is what every body says i do not trust my own	 1042.4060971780716
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he	 36.93137426242143
forster i thought i should have died and that made the men suspect	 176.8958401068077
it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said	 334.2705558890712
notice the two first dances however brought a return of distress	 914.7356064695822
disgrace	 2.0190770273117145
the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable	 11.532130130870442
hand but in vain elizabeth was determined nor did sir william at all	 1399.4893948020951
however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually	 222.676291333192
paid she had no knowledge of it it was then disclosed in the following	 402.1169123685196
was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased	 373.0159025175415
establishment were gained	 3.5077678803583097
charge for the ebooks unless you receive specific permission if you	 1323.5747338098197
feel on his behalf is natural and amiable i cannot but wonder	 1107.9188329597234
nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his	 775.2907312582497
likely to make her more elegant elizabeth did all she could to shield	 300.2772543025828
that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her	 645.5226053300886
minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion she	 234.17455062885176
is not this nice is not this an agreeable surprise	 521.0462413057155
is a shade in a character but you have chosen your fault welli	 55.39951738696293
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again the promised	 966.9761470899166
neither manner nor sense to recommend him stupid men are the only ones	 823.1935405302661
she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of	 700.9945325174888
good siryou had better neglect your relations than run the risk of	 192.10984114083146
bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant and the respect which he	 1121.6824684256233
vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for	 723.040383825753
and what arts did he use to separate them	 72.74063719147834
particularly hurts me i will have no reserves from you mr darcy	 69.40572568540675
who seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiable	 874.5511173225228
gown and with her hair half finished crying out	 70.71770869867655
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on	 262.0342797599271
consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents	 149.75040395282852
but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal	 369.6379552436325
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever	 68.94584430515701
with believing that she would have been his only choice had fortune	 701.8080304901432
make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was	 356.8315289867504
about the house in restless ecstacy calling for every ones	 215.77785431263473
my motive for cautioning you is as follows we have reason to imagine	 714.8227705359653
from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally	 85.44730394534486
the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the	 359.8907589145542
had said enough to keep him quiet	 165.08004794080634
prevailed on to get out	 61.38053179063722
with his conduct she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear	 219.93936678860567
they were of course all intending to be surprised but their	 115.62716174633412
wedding need not be put off for mr darcy might have done as well	 643.7071014122369
my diligence and care send back your answer as soon as you can	 184.8783981583256
material a step without her ladyships concurrence	 65.34360007064417
corrupt data transcription errors a copyright or other intellectual	 5.79260702080982
know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his	 413.62940056274255
who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had she	 589.4444228342026
there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment	 351.7287041512442
greaterwhat shall i call it susceptibility to her feelings which are	 66.33629269665556
on the following monday mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her	 147.57975760096676
lace upon mrs hursts gown	 52.31490162936266
intended	 279.5227122961039
have	 17.669198374158064
of all that she had heard it was not to be supposed that any other	 20.172204395250176
sometimes cold did january and february pass away march was to take	 848.0536710446717
other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good lydia has no	 490.20591160122655
be seen the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable	 178.01772054522954
prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate	 345.50996915373605
with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was	 121.59166294813821
hope though you have but a short lease	 243.6390797039329
she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued	 153.89534857961274
hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her	 93.22739866831172
of them talk fast enough and wickham who happened to sit near	 1147.6133513469686
for such a visit was delighted at her entrance she was not equal	 1109.3813712332867
lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking	 274.907181925245
yes he had no engagement at all for tomorrow and her invitation was	 961.1845435640624
delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits mr	 114.2173012240302

his taste or his good manners	 389.4002707090063
<URL>	 2.9715410952893753
turned to him and said	 6.456271737700129
prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished and their	 307.69851919850004
and avarice begin last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me	 482.04968083762463
i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask me as well as lydia	 880.6578128209605
appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings	 1379.9414265326388
he had been some time with mr gardiner who with two or three other	 334.04926111760517
leaving wickham she was sure they should be married some time or	 844.6743095953326
reserved disagreeable girl yet he knew to the contrary himself he	 723.6288202724825
it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should	 617.1909434785864
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the	 86.42588896087025
the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a	 98.9223028036132
and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt let me hear	 154.59449953999524
king and the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth with jane	 130.42347017132568
less interesting mode of attachment be that as it may she saw him go	 1462.7572053711383
aye there she comes continued mrs bennet looking as unconcerned	 541.3342958645725
and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though	 164.9550006108034
these visits she examined into their employments looked at their work	 554.6826353009429
me but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well	 142.64810537606925
he was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that	 179.9770018154682
mrs gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked	 620.6962165861136
as you describe mr bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl	 657.4931096448021
she enquired after his sister but could do no more	 228.82912986142597
upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the	 176.10672570423696
quick in its execution he begged to know farther particulars of what he	 68.3597306432174
her no more but though the probability of the statement was admitted at	 68.76277315850865
sorry it went off but these things happen so often a young man such	 2269.130668582318
or lady concerned in it deserved but at last your uncle was forced	 1161.9575062986296
is less certain	 207.0664632910953
yes madam said mrs bennet delighted to speak to a lady catherine	 960.5404776143703
miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a	 619.385851570737
with a fare from london and as he thought the circumstance of a	 159.59587587484006
the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt it soothed	 41.73181677897477
him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in	 404.33010577739566
five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about	 421.89418124870895
elopement to no creature had it been revealed where secresy was	 272.5690951610622
requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing	 972.37219173421
of his designing friends and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to	 95.72330322961355
surmount even in speaking to mr bingley whose blind partiality	 494.0325902817228
seemed nothing but absence of mind	 128.3746786733827
my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i	 294.4087639124359
i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she your	 162.60742085012646
very welland this offer of marriage you have refused	 118.51889337962179
thing but himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs gardiner	 231.998557177055
nowhy should he if it was not allowable for him to gain my	 30.82436917228207
evenings may do a great deal	 120.73176934274326
prejudiced absurd	 2.2759724581815157
how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains i felt a	 1002.9888763284159
the church door and every body had as much to say or to hear on the	 303.6405799145657
elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not	 84.4346805029901
but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so	 710.7709803729501
pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the	 375.19461234085384
money my uncle cried jane what do you mean sir	 713.3195601155867
fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper	 210.9809091970368
what he ever was	 149.53930262798553
doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections you	 628.6897811654352
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his	 66.64039297025039
that mr wickham had accepted their uncles invitation and was then in	 362.51097691175016
her younger daughters she could not take upon her to sayshe could	 605.0169016140266
wickham can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe	 817.5185207426272
mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted and	 274.62162818359013

if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to	 152.06490607421355
younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by	 427.49842720761967
gracechurchstreet monday	 2.2759724581815157

daughter	 21.214312469846977
an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth from this day you must	 282.7704395061197

that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as	 177.55222940010447
may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him and to him too	 545.7303567154713
but darcy was clever he was at the same time haughty reserved and	 37.85480965352888
certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i	 783.5593743776783
mrs reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy drawn	 262.7929319587868

write for me we will settle with your father about the money	 981.4500498307782
us all which must arise from the public notice of lydias unguarded and	 295.8112396731248

against you had they been indifferent or had they even been	 1891.7566776090962
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park when	 676.1492388342215
without actual blame on either side	 230.11980930656068
she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty mrs hurst	 665.4123023283084
of usual cheerfulness but with no farther attempt to distinguish	 391.89117394547554
colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but darcy	 698.328809328054
would be in her power to say something of the bingleys	 82.56469347802135
make his communication public on the contrary every particular relative	 357.49856581454503
still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth what do i not	 2505.7398299297174
coolly will be rather a confirmation of it if indeed such a report	 170.31175546789058
directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of mr darcys	 106.33010574780151
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage	 287.4981427938957
answered her hopes but alas the ladies had crowded round the table	 413.3909226660384
right my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how	 644.8810243817752
to depart mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing	 161.8323628628436
could not approve him nor could she for a moment repent her refusal or	 67.44925680741841

intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours	 365.35535708632113
mr bingley was good looking and gentlemanlike he had a pleasant	 419.39007937081107
heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day and tell my dear	 1539.6764487260027

to shake off her gravity i am trying to make it out	 27.739140566788677
error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been	 180.5394247549726

upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for	 140.11244772197557
there seemed an embargo on every subject at last she recollected that	 350.5543288206068
in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex	 49.57944938069949
liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a	 372.1162280535455
i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you	 209.91751022547268
loose to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible	 124.34071269112978
enough to make her understand his character	 10.755539536301455
as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side miss	 504.217512294741
she had herself endured on a similar occasion five and twenty years	 1027.568138964694
pemberley was now georgianas home and the attachment of the sisters	 1051.3263631802834
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as	 410.74150129722153
pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintance every day but	 3498.478128988092
superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of	 735.9656716584452
house they could not be necessary and it was not till easterday	 160.20656379934067
she felt herself to be right	 59.42185595144146
say if this be the case he deserves you i could not have parted with	 925.8972299327215
i mention it to you mr robinsons asking him how he liked our meryton	 714.1737395241245
but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied	 88.20504178499182

to him oh how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation	 90.00083559875462
of my philosophy think only of the past as its remembrance gives you	 91.98233693440187

elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the	 752.5101051543124
misrepresented	 2.0190770273117145
heaven forbidthat would be the greatest misfortune of allto	 28.33386680309127
reason to question at one time she had almost resolved on applying to	 354.0161308294747

lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so	 1012.0471012965246
elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a	 49.15528026334194
deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is	 576.0316656275855
bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the	 834.1641314889525
economy and other amiable qualifications	 181.36074494135656
out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all	 336.2840383622801

a little longer on your kindness	 189.75888658954213
campand from her correspondence with her sister there was still less	 132.30033488963105
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners	 257.50786234975754
gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothing	 914.119885690234
nothing to do elsewhere	 19.402624080375574
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce but as to your	 94.33590638425689
body	 24.49179644708492

chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr collins	 58.689462869225586
sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon	 626.2879387468512

abusive without saying any thing just but one cannot be always laughing	 568.1111993443945
suitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his own	 5.642531164241461
he was silent	 5.36015661650966
her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied	 587.6543283762317
she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton	 394.48939778271006
by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by	 201.09677483335525
miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he	 133.40513437610778
summer	 21.9491349444114
his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as shewed an	 148.31935418303496
women in the room and which he thought the prettiest and his	 298.5564884777766
with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself she was very	 322.24502067158176
the day of his and lydias departure soon came and mrs bennet was	 141.67514546680644

wonder at her being where she was	 50.44836417858684
his concern at having been prevented by business they then went away	 383.33078696990367
with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to	 372.62585404757664
her eldest sister ah jane i take your place now and you must go	 244.62926717994463
substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and	 94.5532079542955
he then told her of georgianas delight in her acquaintance and of her	 217.27702628445002
a point should admit of doubt but really i know not what to say	 226.92122116828617
elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else and after a pause of	 181.88949218291665
i should imagine not	 147.3302393709914
all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must yet	 654.7052229520266
feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence of those	 43.06796596134837
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting	 444.0074231151322
twelvemonth happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance if	 761.0948582007143
darcy made no answer he seemed scarcely to hear her and was walking up	 300.7102986044457
probably more than she felt for herself the carriage was sent to meet	 1586.301162727345
dearest jane who could have done less for her but make a virtue of it	 478.4730275582223
resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence	 158.88933599766753
and if he does colonel forster will hire him my aunt told me so	 369.72459890502734
feelings though fervent were little displayed and that there was a	 121.98792643421127

they each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with mr	 1166.6878222508433

pens remarkably well	 4.182411637568533

pleasantry her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in	 297.8335339699181

as they walked home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass	 396.71538808314534
elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer than	 101.70239278612422
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of a	 65.69055608247713

that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion when mr	 299.0611850685504
advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though	 1528.1199937968527
believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this	 661.7264586417754
interferingand elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and	 68.93217144397889
wait in the drawingroom and whose shyness as they had not seen her	 376.3825183499462
she is a most charming young lady indeed lady catherine herself says	 510.8831498547666
herself but that after their removal it had been every where	 581.8001343375789
acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect	 258.5058180082408
disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a	 35.18366665736049
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first	 346.02131210671143
jane had written the direction remarkably ill	 321.51852780900424
enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting	 211.49744685658695

heaven are quite well	 29.33996340145143
elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her	 26.267816863230625
pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted	 810.9980504211519
i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short	 41.934273076014975
making any answer she went on as before	 638.4475394256841
thought she could witness without trepidation	 33.90090515693936
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said	 302.4437387754499
advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts the advice	 225.943204287357
till it were proved against them but jane knows as well as i do what	 376.92586118448133
pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they	 300.5494569087213

that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged she would not	 60.20056747332248

she will never deserve to be happy what a meeting for her when she	 180.2469378654457
sister my dear father i congratulate you	 222.09184550320973
rather offended and therefore checked her laugh miss bingley warmly	 154.02701972932107
certainly replied elizabeththere are such people but i hope i am	 463.0924310207566

if we are ever able to learn what wickhams debts have been said	 764.9798688672741
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand jane now came up	 228.06211609597702
he shook his headi wish i could call her amiable it gives me pain	 513.2186675896091
others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so	 365.75455831041455
said mrs bennet to her husband and all the others equally well	 145.08670446353773
fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they	 327.3814954857995
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour bingley	 257.4936964776596
the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact	 472.1972465383218
particulars but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to	 141.42216326252557
much better i am sick of them all thank heaven i am going tomorrow	 295.8783257256059
much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of	 311.87230274208775
mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and	 809.8972237908148
can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it	 749.7278843705858
to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had	 759.813702502568
i hope you will consent to be of the party indeed eliza you will be	 224.10114281362667
his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be	 827.9585455206794
them mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding	 69.93035044080565
imaginary but still he would be her husbandwithout thinking highly	 500.0803657798943
acquaintance that are really accomplished	 262.8680835585948
mr collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which	 268.84229744155874
so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear that	 197.4425724539926
honours us during your stay here her behaviour to my dear charlotte is	 1058.0779640934636
no cheerful humour mr darcy was almost as far from her as the table	 769.8991790390571
his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling that had	 220.59323642042602
had often great enjoyment out of doors her favourite walk and where	 501.06922650281297

unaffected though not quite so chatty jane was anxious that no	 140.38417950830723
the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost	 43.24037495323097
the house	 3.313082517864653
according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that	 244.2489983126319
mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made	 308.3041669503414
you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him	 320.04457059906076
and that its illsuccess might perhaps authorise her to seek the other	 134.4401223451966
you i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you	 761.0141207336459

well jane who is it from what is it about what does he say well	 1268.275822085088
late to be saving mrs bennet had no turn for economy and her	 399.0347194563068
mr and mrs gardiners coming up they were all pressed to go into the	 91.08496875883013
of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some	 182.11296703677914
the match his being such a charming young man and so rich and living	 1422.7261476352005
they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in	 223.580145808258
tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of	 192.98896771791172
weeks and to mrs gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction the	 1173.8521696096661
ever since he was four years old	 143.70168889594171
thought was still worse not a syllable was uttered by either and	 626.7803511548362
tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in	 920.768064088257
silent till they reached the house their father then went to the	 441.98225313821405
a little	 4.152159059720282
though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in	 530.7587842705401
of having a companion	 421.96146110582885
to whom i have related the affair they agree with me in	 811.2996890054475

a word about it till now	 127.74264496537126
spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to	 109.10763400301492
much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort	 1007.2394102459087
father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy	 258.87893659027424
and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he	 775.1407874146919
to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark	 270.42761012686475
was surprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme	 600.3618153555594
and then we were so merry all the way home we talked and laughed so	 279.0127336299219

communication would therefore do for all after a slight preparation	 563.8883188439643
but mr gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours	 609.3753418940651
that is to say you had given your permission i guessed as much and	 448.46762915534515
that whether married or single he must always be her model of the	 535.8104242511166
ever had any thing from him except a few presents well i am so happy	 640.2041860269221
