Average Perplexity: 675.2893569838129
"If he does not come to me, _then_," said she, "I shall give him up for	 36.970415348894804
ever."	 753.6941685825765
The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have	 39.23027128074361
answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,	 151.62376462677278
where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,	 111.0739258087483
in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her,	 106.61070514948631
which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of	 43.016070799549034
the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,	 83.55381714506059
"The men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;	 433.29369784622935
do we?"	 423.24744904354014
Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with	 103.48879985094356
her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience	 221.32929979308278
enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself	 196.27518038055942
for being so silly!	 235.9847189164787
"A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to	 64.75635281024971
expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not	 134.9310978918637
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?	 72.82770912054634
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!"	 45.67084619493312
She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup	 71.36274804009295
himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,	 60.319774363748095
"Is your sister at Pemberley still?"	 414.6971305826934
"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas."	 644.3317801568966
"And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?"	 431.8362493128638
"Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough,	 113.91615072702845
these three weeks."	 299.63805905654885
She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse	 34.047673026726834
with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for	 250.30876191402737
some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering	 93.67471482187091
to Elizabeth again, he walked away.	 53.18985882221551
When the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies	 96.95649245139916
all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when	 60.12455006443444
all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her	 102.04112901515617
mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated	 56.912006044816366
with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.	 103.87889744878008
They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had	 26.112060536722776
nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side	 125.89178538817032
of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.	 71.98828752761281
Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to	 139.35220322110771
supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the	 94.47949503115085
others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.	 24.218171483250494
"Well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "What	 74.24611255219389
say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,	 224.10434367322134
I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The	 87.72193493248153
venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat	 31.50947007943688
a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the	 94.04690818601948
Lucas's last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges	 74.20821589818803
were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French	 74.65426754149351
cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater	 78.18862363566461
beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And	 353.04799890692635
what do you think she said besides? 'Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her	 80.94050967598561
at Netherfield at last.' She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good	 83.01433559151158
a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,	 264.4683915205087
and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously."	 103.16803221026161
Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of	 144.85473366876448
Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at	 56.20276208096921
last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy	 122.52542161173794
humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at	 156.45619628204636
not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.	 106.6256487804643
"It has been a very agreeable day," said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. "The	 58.13160121802742
party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we	 142.16282774634863
may often meet again."	 307.8169824146654
Elizabeth smiled.	 598.3278417946401
"Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I	 56.991247007374604
assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an	 102.07074232591476
agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am	 271.7895820174567
perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any	 107.27127676423788
design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with	 94.77940520586549
greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally	 225.93563843274742
pleasing than any other man."	 175.9449894471286
"You are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and	 66.34057282775024
are provoking me to it every moment."	 90.38884116065348
"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!"	 127.46285322839455
"And how impossible in others!"	 814.2050936320176
"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I	 49.935474298993924
acknowledge?"	 8.776652323334677
"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to	 44.908728532723664
instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive	 504.91248049757854
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your	 98.68681572632381
confidante."	 8.776652323334677
CHAPTER XIII.	 12.911953956184709
A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His	 134.90998221960513
friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in	 80.45469836354205
ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably	 308.753049948064
good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many	 66.10652034021157
expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.	 444.81007819101535
"Next time you call," said she, "I hope we shall be more lucky."	 103.09160690386965
He should be particularly happy at any time, &c. &c.; and if she would	 51.043443467640145
give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.	 253.10906318530755
"Can you come to-morrow?"	 286.9998637639421
Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was	 139.85089587684726
accepted with alacrity.	 145.46956042276744
He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them	 145.43097991429374
dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing	 33.08151590467916
gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,	 315.89444418285933
"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is	 90.90528282116134
come.--He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss	 131.04753294048086
Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss	 416.02795127214074
Lizzy's hair."	 10.85925182058365
"We will be down as soon as we can," said Jane; "but I dare say Kitty is	 73.3869664288057
forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago."	 131.3067643675863
"Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick!	 853.148683095903
where is your sash my dear?"	 90.42969309702876
But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down	 40.790185202754245
without one of her sisters.	 74.86832178160824
The same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the	 113.61547552621246
evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his	 233.5977285546268
custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the	 164.4358118581755
five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at	 1458.4549589532646
Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any	 94.43452142108843
impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last	 71.77769506531737
Kitty did, she very innocently said, "What is the matter mamma? What do	 122.99489692531318
you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?"	 143.7529679355516
"Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you." She then sat still five	 446.23243855662594
minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she	 81.45252068906694
suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,	 835.9029900466139
"Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room.	 75.01509107437558
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth, which spoke her distress at	 268.8378798003832
such premeditation, and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it.	 52.49549025686087
In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half opened the door and called out,	 138.98169288520313
"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you."	 52.80650300903657
Elizabeth was forced to go.	 20.184226610805872
"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her mother as	 133.7657853050516
soon as she was in the hall. "Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in	 89.16562573007283
my dressing-room."	 59.25692251053868
Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained	 83.5591691536741
quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned	 192.5525808516925
into the drawing-room.	 73.89299800084426
Mrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every	 88.17894772635202
thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His	 119.41932983051987
ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their	 284.5121522951663
evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the	 37.05347108769413
mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command	 126.5103948233541
of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter.	 717.3373496270319
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went	 155.5220649009157
away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.	 820.1263276491605
Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.	 91.00670146173657
After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed	 208.7232040842353
between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in	 93.15238844138385
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy	 474.99340179671754
returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably	 583.5157099821708
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's	 59.33944558884934
concurrence.	 8.776652323334677
Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the	 44.3054242308739
morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more	 127.4001520399616
agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption	 107.56148163510824
or folly in Bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him	 182.2509824707433
into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the	 59.11906564496292
other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;	 216.66863298730107
and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to get	 42.83464672893714
every body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter	 60.23440536978876
to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;	 1469.8364098968818
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be	 59.701415584746314
wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.	 40.38586650240186
But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she	 691.2476214536921
saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother	 103.78375553747732
had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her	 111.50733108177168
sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in	 326.9508870798203
earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of	 143.9088527696419
both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would	 214.20059669836488
have told it all. _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _her's_ she	 169.66892307150098
thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and	 159.7671244624506
Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as	 76.34760799389721
well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few	 97.04544657784332
words to her sister, ran out of the room.	 45.295506600420595
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give	 211.20377398394473
pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest	 133.5084372139206
emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.	 28.13608166578503
"'Tis too much!" she added, "by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh!	 191.70772513026014
why is not every body as happy?"	 157.1572543945087
Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a	 104.43466247532248
delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of	 550.2326239038779
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not	 43.85734193247884
allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be	 245.9452309422557
said, for the present.	 146.29522359642888
"I must go instantly to my mother;" she cried. "I would not on any	 133.9456642208459
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it	 556.1550340796013
from any one but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to	 119.82862613958648
know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear	 151.90933891085243
family! how shall I bear so much happiness!"	 453.0743977685169
She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the	 33.90085845073595
card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.	 379.34589815668056
Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease	 127.4136377737628
with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many	 89.70758002854659
previous months of suspense and vexation.	 124.21548106211304
"And this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious	 168.89376605895697
circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the	 18.403120214136756
happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"	 1234.1358382205938
In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her	 61.89711578560623
father had been short and to the purpose.	 70.70880281012681
"Where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door.	 90.28027471286794
"With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment I dare say."	 77.7983865436391
He then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and	 42.83656636133258
affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her	 347.318934806167
delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with	 79.79799461683729
great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen	 94.23447809034566
to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections;	 55.08992075374545
and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his	 89.38742154894555
expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for	 58.9066666470746
basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of	 134.81888728940942
Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and	 77.07035250806648
himself.	 543.2586490566042
It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of	 78.86465389916852
Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as	 85.70509818193275
made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped	 476.5552211280951
her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent, or	 128.09707697777023
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,	 381.13186398498624
though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when	 50.39863720697521
Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed	 136.7275775928425
how really happy he was.	 220.52693162200254
Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their	 132.48346674430869
visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he	 67.7179960469828
turned to his daughter and said,	 129.34527220565093
"Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman."	 44.88236457398985
Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his	 73.07863434595765
goodness.	 83422.52464587911
"You are a good girl;" he replied, "and I have great pleasure in	 24.443349903678545
thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your	 33.693674606510264
doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are	 100.71664492352356
each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so	 110.93663547494612
easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will	 170.9003305065296
always exceed your income."	 565.735831649853
"I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters, would be	 406.1524558599032
unpardonable in _me_."	 64.37266942731615
"Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet," cried his wife, "what are you	 43.59987750250033
talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely	 147.81132603965165
more." Then addressing her daughter, "Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so	 83.88764034965779
happy! I am sure I sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it	 47.550624446538734
would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not	 66.6785355623818
be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when	 174.66374951514143
he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was	 147.70990042716537
that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that	 113.68993697163015
ever was seen!"	 256.4306238098133
Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her	 274.8742195895494
favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger	 512.2773487034597
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness	 400.55247074122263
which she might in future be able to dispense.	 92.91625896552841
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty	 75.7227640498355
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.	 256.4858171695001
Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;	 64.64182659152095
coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after	 1063.6753168808655
supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough	 345.9312046811741
detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought	 51.33335468929439
himself obliged to accept.	 245.577567558534
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for	 48.37976629082804
while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else;	 61.08942706919797
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those	 59.446183098478585
hours of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane,	 134.22619535986993
he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of	 116.43640853836378
her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of	 98.23143472443454
relief.	 23973.2499249522
"He has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me, that	 164.08940402112873
he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not	 143.87180656416433
believed it possible."	 224.67314495271808
"I suspected as much," replied Elizabeth. "But how did he account for	 235.7832440654082
it?"	 110.84070322522837
"It must have been his sister's doing. They were certainly no friends to	 294.74385957266725
his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have	 76.42130943549343
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,	 336.3594254787794
as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will	 96.54061110581374
learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we	 70.88445026097494
can never be what we once were to each other."	 134.14211490568778
"That is the most unforgiving speech," said Elizabeth, "that I ever	 87.02053787135068
heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again	 133.86722550562874
the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard."	 22.532934205402498
"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,	 316.5683617983074
he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being	 161.24168147911288
indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!"	 173.13090688888667
"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his	 39.29895212696114
modesty."	 49274.943468904996
This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and	 130.81282102891151
the little value he put on his own good qualities.	 314.6835699779772
Elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference	 23.972107161981725
of his friend, for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving	 37.52398167133245
heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice	 89.17038182511884
her against him.	 449.82191238528804
"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" cried	 224.39559558800357
Jane. "Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed	 211.43806043141907
above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but	 73.65804418403542
such another man for you!"	 501.0377414685842
"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as	 63.31396308416793
you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your	 159.11933958487384
happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very	 150.66875500646634
good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time."	 197.72633441859955
The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a	 54.17029030566874
secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, and	 16.911770452415478
_she_ ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her	 62.361359524074686
neighbours in Meryton.	 35.47865197806588
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the	 57.81414003189691
world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,	 140.76492024614566
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.	 218.35106464478721
CHAPTER XIV.	 12.911953956184709
One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been	 195.11193363153475
formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the	 64.08041095687354
dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the	 300.7110119260317
sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the	 185.77831815083283
lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the	 67.37335156916915
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses	 78.88485921119332
were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who	 74.93896051414428
preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that	 52.03717120064715
somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid	 455.65285776865073
the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the	 38.41663068432139
shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three	 31.63182222365866
continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown	 184.91426649147775
open, and their visitor entered. It was lady Catherine de Bourgh.	 73.42007084049986
They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their	 120.72713699931398
astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.	 108.02442167073644
Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even	 153.30533648621494
inferior to what Elizabeth felt.	 66.97643784145956
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no	 87.08183898290993
other reply to Elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the	 191.16630359351163
head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her	 117.79411483253125
name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of	 207.4199501972067
introduction had been made.	 331.64428391834633
Mrs. Bennet all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such	 160.149945933552
high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting	 201.45329052553944
for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,	 55.57055213545083
"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady I suppose is your mother."	 71.60349358123533
Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.	 58.880619508970426
"And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters."	 43.242235647067815
"Yes, madam," said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a lady Catherine.	 52.63953640289844
"She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all, is lately married,	 598.1619097370665
and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man,	 101.0026763861951
who I believe will soon become a part of the family."	 110.96054647412906
"You have a very small park here," returned Lady Catherine after a short	 183.70545288677496
silence.	 1740.426410148688
"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I	 45.704021585562835
assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's."	 65.02875346407849
"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in	 71.3304608995389
summer; the windows are full west."	 331.68137898667453
Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then	 145.63443260748704
added,	 3357.0063060612597
"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and	 195.97481847371554
Mrs. Collins well."	 437.6695765713704
"Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last."	 371.95300980146334
Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from	 89.07047420797865
Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no	 545.6343773461354
letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.	 164.61558062006787
Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some	 78.39109108848515
refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,	 53.55300874906814
declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth,	 164.04512433268033
"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness	 32.193281564523964
on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you	 34.277530640910705
will favour me with your company."	 421.36474626674544
"Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and shew her ladyship about the	 46.380341276409396
different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage."	 34.06627226249333
Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,	 49.79400906110862
attended her noble guest down stairs. As they passed through the hall,	 317.0517779458146
Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and	 194.2191761865247
drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent	 45.96276700855718
looking rooms, walked on.	 7508.226577576261
Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her	 51.306776498733285
waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk	 93.45560524856892
that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for	 55.76587326061606
conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and	 102.17947526684173
disagreeable.	 1974.0752064033145
"How could I ever think her like her nephew?" said she, as she looked in	 134.3907646418436
her face.	 136.41849818071617
As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following	 21.987094611066464
manner:--	 1199.7215049482604
"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my	 165.39036978907913
journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I	 152.10593756531955
come."	 1771.9188112582679
Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.	 115.9389983065734
"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account	 40.33097242998998
for the honour of seeing you here."	 39.02549586487295
"Miss Bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to	 177.52592849040497
know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may	 41.533332508386856
choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been	 61.43768166607365
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such	 43.31499700158885
moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most	 71.88908626103958
alarming nature, reached me two days ago. I was told, that not only your	 210.03458131469702
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that	 52.36920340850465
_you_, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon	 151.80290492974555
afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I	 300.8267681330039
_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood; though I would not injure him	 19.509619756319033
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on	 85.60914615784326
setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to	 269.8025069820486
you."	 90.8842218880159
"If you believed it impossible to be true," said Elizabeth, colouring	 37.37181898362491
with astonishment and disdain, "I wonder you took the trouble of coming	 157.36847248073397
so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?"	 223.57704622068587
"At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted."	 135.60444849246696
"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family," said Elizabeth,	 68.34930902518249
coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report	 85.20002812567836
is in existence."	 73.09308530630015
"If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been	 79.8598500115353
industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a	 31.143152535734618
report is spread abroad?"	 187.01830224513975
"I never heard that it was."	 19.709246295187206
"And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?"	 110.29666919940631
"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. _You_	 61.37523138925685
may ask questions, which _I_ shall not choose to answer."	 151.24700319361096
"This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has	 85.8605942480383
he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?"	 115.80515177119669
"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible."	 238.09485699322016
"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his	 38.116970296295975
reason. But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,	 75.88655629199744
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You	 45.8463096814423
may have drawn him in."	 187.95378353157622
"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it."	 78.41546006189735
"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such	 39.723546213654274
language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,	 105.69875075922735
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns."	 496.7881398316277
"But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as	 65.93742546052748
this, ever induce me to be explicit."	 65.10021053580606
"Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the	 136.48948118358604
presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is	 112.39647074423272
engaged to _my daughter_. Now what have you to say?"	 169.63854961079005
"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will	 103.1723118002715
make an offer to me."	 98.15225750081812
Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,	 34.300556543133034
"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,	 117.88269255818486
they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of	 110.95105202654979
_his_ mother, as well as of her's. While in their cradles, we planned	 97.32819184465114
the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would	 132.4915581879608
be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of	 77.76502196301227
inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to	 31.676447503187756
the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his	 113.15270006799756
tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of	 83.87850220544047
propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say, that from his	 372.0511666901494
earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"	 55.47036927295644
"Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no	 37.12817452596728
other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be	 212.0680408390344
kept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry	 258.7278261466864
Miss De Bourgh. You both did as much as you could, in planning the	 106.79729734468575
marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by	 228.94213421613685
honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make	 287.0992500937122
another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?"	 820.8037315905862
"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes, Miss	 1912.150140191363
Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or	 183.22479978044873
friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will	 45.96671805272618
be censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him.	 24.511922897351376
Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned	 209.01001840913455
by any of us."	 113.72030933998099
"These are heavy misfortunes," replied Elizabeth. "But the wife of Mr.	 53.28184644225956
Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily	 151.97816114651397
attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause	 253.3926085310012
to repine."	 18.54108917904826
"Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude	 97.43608484825928
for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that	 216.3294548779456
score?	 8.776652323334677
"Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here	 109.70404531972787
with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be	 323.32492017520866
dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person's whims.	 43.71693381988432
I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment."	 26.48992597759376
"_That_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable;	 258.55152216806437
but it will have no effect on _me_."	 182.63948579051788
"I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my	 286.7781940723648
nephew are formed for each other. They are descended on the maternal	 141.2951858055919
side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable,	 679.3073134064548
honourable, and ancient, though untitled families. Their fortune on both	 126.44334495338602
sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of	 47.331719366414696
every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them? The	 37.15297675858628
upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or	 87.10383129542694
fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you	 68.37959260227939
were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere,	 77.39631674443625
in which you have been brought up."	 27.665275590507363
"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that	 541.2091049395564
sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are	 73.56238427523728
equal."	 3755.4294423101096
"True. You _are_ a gentleman's daughter. But who was your mother? Who	 165.41067462533357
are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their	 133.45499892857617
condition."	 8.776652323334677
"Whatever my connections may be," said Elizabeth, "if your nephew does	 260.30266020929713
not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_."	 80.33976520275672
"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"	 307.06984945827173
Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady	 59.190434376751504
Catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a	 421.9077165001437
moment's deliberation,	 648.5748716106357
"I am not."	 14.74553329213899
Lady Catherine seemed pleased.	 23.289583282420352
"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"	 511.5124493661346
"I will make no promise of the kind."	 236.83456887996664
"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more	 84.83878994151296
reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I	 90.37355021033989
will ever recede. I shall not go away, till you have given me the	 46.009095855121
assurance I require."	 866.1044309837986
"And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into	 56.20130863345647
anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry	 415.3439042747951
your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise, make	 617.6538378472861
_their_ marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to	 162.566416100681
me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it	 526.7555680342216
on his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with	 63.48498096500927
which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as	 226.80743117460713
frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my	 116.45179863282405
character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.	 54.3992132898828
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,	 250.69196150067367
I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in	 127.26837772674013
mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the	 125.39570585535066
subject."	 1365.1661446071594
"Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the	 46.87293314843796
objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am no	 161.18129367013714
stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous	 189.7856954568026
elopement. I know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a	 89.70989399730841
patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is	 109.05976793865722
_such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister? Is _her_ husband, is the son of	 86.21835931006142
his late father's steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what	 511.03663963274505
are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?"	 146.4785551557474
"You can _now_ have nothing farther to say," she resentfully answered.	 82.6436985498717
"You have insulted me, in every possible method. I must beg to return to	 61.57181549688804
the house."	 41.77615155782918
And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned	 58.46799553461307
back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.	 74.41422287852251
"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!	 210.72715376284972
Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you,	 79.05116757463428
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"	 81.61947979379624
"Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say. You know my sentiments."	 77.9300935388324
"You are then resolved to have him?"	 151.4141731683779
"I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,	 58.87361576464626
which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without	 154.23629214612407
reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."	 84.09877531096423
"It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the	 38.578967787651806
claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in	 121.65069651909353
the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world."	 47.72508176604416
"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "have any	 1493.5837165598448
possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either,	 173.17805846761033
would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the	 41.99623571076623
resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former	 131.98998814121228
_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's	 168.19753445508147
concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in	 124.3397667097687
the scorn."	 12.232663865601651
"And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I	 67.08027966592232
shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your	 93.22975294129418
ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you	 223.13861132882136
reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point."	 51.31762843200457
In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of	 63.58352026839222
the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,	 916.980585489986
"I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your	 130.20693842055675
mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased."	 457.17704788318315
Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her	 21.054498869145938
ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She	 197.23581970216836
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother	 109.46337513435104
impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady	 142.8890963413928
Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.	 202.9729423321353
"She did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go."	 36.571660464573434
"She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously	 51.70020439564256
civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.	 176.7397628098901
She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so passing through	 290.227919508254
Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had	 189.9644280053949
nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?"	 259.3215503877042
Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to	 93.47925937071555
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.	 30.283404756327606
CHAPTER XV.	 12.911953956184709
The discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw	 662.4002770164
Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many	 248.1555774549998
hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine it	 88.13117855055
appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,	 371.22903171146396
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.	 148.1414477179652
Darcy. It was a rational scheme to be sure! but from what the report of	 81.1506723777844
their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;	 265.40607762813653
till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,	 220.02215920507274
and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the	 107.81808146567198
expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply	 304.24232817570004
the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her	 80.42697417092502
sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at	 398.887825440238
Lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the	 505.28338684678835
Collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine) had only	 170.40195586925398
set _that_ down, as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked	 970.8912879470017
forward to as possible, at some future time.	 197.77825446404822
In revolving lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help	 91.36199093794431
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting	 93.24548087845073
in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to	 96.85148672035831
prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate	 131.27824715921204
an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar	 81.37582354166693
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared	 135.54552504027023
not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his	 38.661391662248185
aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose	 223.14307192344344
that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it	 62.98532819055972
was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,	 40.85909673401614
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would	 272.6247715486702
address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would	 65.4876043693528
probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak	 123.44467636722271
and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.	 48.85194281060443
If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often	 80.46155868735791
seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might	 287.46775705888473
settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity	 102.76737535740587
unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady	 89.36453689859769
Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to	 126.79096036024961
Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.	 197.96545521508423
"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to	 258.68743698645375
his friend within a few days," she added, "I shall know how to	 66.51138629414129
understand it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of	 310.4920256861924
his constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might	 72.74847707341888
have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him	 93.02438937745023
at all."	 47.76858931556188
The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had	 53.14972836966409
been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same	 178.97914601088436
kind of supposition, which had appeased Mrs. Bennet's curiosity; and	 52.741430563124
Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject.	 44.543398256787476
The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her	 40.05064780551611
father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.	 75.8712822951044
"Lizzy," said he, "I was going to look for you; come into my room."	 98.50673706017155
She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell	 65.8413383912294
her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner	 52.39682737482225
connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might	 77.52891479132795
be from lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the	 45.23184028060559
consequent explanations.	 10.85925182058365
She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He	 113.86970605574298
then said,	 264.08526567519095
"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me	 156.77629280545807
exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its	 399.1372133762245
contents. I did not know before, that I had _two_ daughters on the brink	 52.62119727023989
of matrimony. Let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest."	 66.11031426972724
The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous	 124.48323887711811
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;	 147.17990266758702
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained	 203.85939188546485
himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to	 181.41666044664467
herself; when her father continued,	 140.45783408596898
"You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters	 237.61678347722508
as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the	 51.47032251884265
name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins."	 71.31835765817341
"From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?"	 59.173132189156185
"Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with	 66.87788198400624
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of	 67.22087849884306
which it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping	 61.85579446428904
Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says	 206.55027657914061
on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows. "Having thus	 423.05196783009285
offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on	 178.3761838984419
this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another:	 349.62704437900254
of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter	 86.21155790049337
Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after	 285.0572736089205
her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate,	 724.4402361755203
may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious	 61.48238905761116
personages in this land."	 13.96453568766463
"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?" "This young	 424.78302697470076
gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of	 73.49956995890119
mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive	 294.1079932770081
patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin	 40.92390123059851
Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate	 120.14156672765615
closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be	 88.54365028057249
inclined to take immediate advantage of."	 679.965701813401
"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out."	 436.892496915681
"My motive for cautioning you, is as follows. We have reason to imagine	 160.28799718313684
that his aunt, lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with	 58.48038444821816
a friendly eye."	 2815.56133199693
"_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_	 172.96044904117815
surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within	 482.07797444690834
the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more	 56.235482105744225
effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any	 146.03237613871974
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in	 103.9161197795953
his life! It is admirable!"	 56.831366344412984
Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force	 127.11260654603873
one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so	 281.7316013956582
little agreeable to her.	 116.50414014369602
"Are you not diverted?"	 47.1167366878101
"Oh! yes. Pray read on."	 439.3775715408743
"After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last	 327.9525464788085
night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she	 269.7341647293422
felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some	 54.94351660015348
family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her	 121.17578029357027
consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty	 57.30791344163426
to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and	 83.55930795894257
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run	 111.77626824057438
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned." "Mr.	 69.75637847224296
Collins moreover adds," "I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad	 644.1481058927637
business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their	 246.07135422579313
living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally	 478.3280489268603
known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain	 118.81063709102024
from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young	 141.1070448889374
couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an	 37.12647672918453
encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should	 66.66763476055726
very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them as	 114.09215586701244
a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names	 384.91353541098664
to be mentioned in your hearing." "_That_ is his notion of christian	 123.20995119052637
forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's	 157.19440452983213
situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you	 210.49430453560012
look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be _Missish_, I	 67.37855895601278
hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we	 91.63120767166795
live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our	 127.93877215512151
turn?"	 4388.775451179707
"Oh!" cried Elizabeth, "I am excessively diverted. But it is so	 38.28770923442548
strange!"	 129952.87207891312
"Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man	 135.37318037277126
it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_	 62.08140125619602
pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate	 88.06906720177093
writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any	 60.33697825245962
consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving	 439.77838181974624
him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and	 370.70615774352996
hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine	 52.72498635208297
about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?"	 194.57601563038182
To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had	 332.03101930730526
been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his	 163.23220220729993
repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her	 83.30395166219004
feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she	 155.139373791133
would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by	 101.4911298041112
what he said of Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but	 76.63125490880387
wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of	 88.29494087680926
his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.	 168.40133231046048
CHAPTER XVI.	 12.911953956184709
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as	 332.5323790587253
Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy	 246.51651306517752
with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's	 199.24469448029262
visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to	 251.5425006413342
tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in	 141.5323959478651
momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed	 68.04921551531542
their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the	 101.63823903073414
habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five	 224.95246332020918
set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to	 145.86690580042458
outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy,	 158.49721724777484
were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was	 202.14168973668203
too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a	 98.64480659453487
desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.	 99.90167207072543
They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon	 172.70058885219103
Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,	 132.8891013562583
when Kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the	 223.56533560004
moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was	 84.30235723851034
high, she immediately said,	 431.4519999732511
"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving	 33.559799797377764
relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding your's. I	 137.92311927598936
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor	 64.61531126994487
sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to	 68.49942930132849
acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest	 49.43529811984983
of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express."	 61.33084537260608
"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise	 164.76299262343002
and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a	 104.84957452066577
mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs.	 143.38222688209052
Gardiner was so little to be trusted."	 78.7366889086411
"You must not blame my aunt. Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to	 114.26430000862136
me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could	 42.90855290849718
not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,	 290.2282500944355
in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced	 189.22623548683157
you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the	 100.64261302554351
sake of discovering them."	 120.30866523303102
"If you _will_ thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself alone.	 154.2420621967117
That the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other	 112.54686337822015
inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your	 75.79478018618192
_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe, I thought	 235.56970033940053
only of _you_."	 226.36002766239403
Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,	 18.225479887543695
her companion added, "You are too generous to trifle with me. If your	 64.54879670024881
feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_	 340.6054877213502
affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence	 305.2788908041655
me on this subject for ever."	 59.583293659004596
Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of	 148.80181835596272
his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not	 292.5242566217012
very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone	 98.2804950574982
so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make	 145.18593337024137
her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances. The	 456.136093318975
happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never	 518.8488282087077
felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as	 66.15766203322562
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth	 359.12165041127463
been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the	 76.86971923811065
expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him;	 315.2335385110175
but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of	 64.10426049759423
feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his	 135.94541540772315
affection every moment more valuable.	 323.78930490029154
They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to	 162.4614883216439
be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She	 300.1585034108936
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding	 411.9208509880967
to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through	 95.94997892161105
London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the	 1001.8147922333936
substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on	 137.97172823044832
every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension,	 184.2949563296572
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that	 201.27206568454534
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from	 140.69627694447877
her nephew, which _she_ had refused to give. But, unluckily for her	 61.36912499098116
ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.	 338.21416648355256
"It taught me to hope," said he, "as I had scarcely ever allowed myself	 97.3780590682002
to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that,	 151.04808345553135
had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have	 232.76237568903682
acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly."	 221.9706535237699
Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "Yes, you know enough of	 196.67065222766587
my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so	 84.8253051122882
abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all	 39.41906470395357
your relations."	 168.24625335332843
"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your	 91.12513375169735
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour	 773.2353343880891
to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof. It was	 44.39270217495685
unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence."	 27.720762066369723
"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that	 179.90709756390126
evening," said Elizabeth. "The conduct of neither, if strictly examined,	 295.37982818477866
will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved	 109.16230373786368
in civility."	 14053.318706552642
"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I	 30.44108558414178
then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of	 309.0045751637194
it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your	 93.94077896169988
reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a	 150.44809979883885
more gentleman-like manner.' Those were your words. You know not, you	 293.0918872612769
can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some	 146.10943483185602
time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice."	 140.06962220652827
"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an	 77.61298239821649
impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such	 79.31413125964794
a way."	 408.3545467700236
"I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper	 119.47039269440454
feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never	 78.72177451936557
forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible	 122.17521507954841
way, that would induce you to accept me."	 142.49389861950834
"Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at	 87.97815938545978
all. I assure you, that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it."	 105.13040917148572
Darcy mentioned his letter. "Did it," said he, "did it _soon_ make you	 319.0316542855919
think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its	 487.54960612639576
contents?"	 8.776652323334677
She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her	 240.24184106782187
former prejudices had been removed.	 183.93793536363157
"I knew," said he, "that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was	 78.08392770125495
necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part	 92.78243412301958
especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the	 187.06945435737225
power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might	 552.2303338467202
justly make you hate me."	 487.61089667146194
"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the	 81.2083044642165
preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my	 69.03761987630972
opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily	 156.24005740421555
changed as that implies."	 416.1956407975987
"When I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, "I believed myself perfectly	 337.2777236261029
calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a	 45.40867901023813
dreadful bitterness of spirit."	 225.5108613403745
"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The	 232.66715569827593
adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings	 114.52862146892608
of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so	 129.51448835101914
widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant	 345.5195299205152
circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten. You must learn some	 303.1670372855701
of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you	 263.45353607302906
pleasure."	 744.4034853600544
"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. _Your_	 80.04958471395187
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment	 49.62900425379065
arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of	 68.16689067669661
ignorance. But with _me_, it is not so. Painful recollections will	 329.3964477453161
intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. I have been a	 60.45511750796266
selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a	 70.18824748779934
child I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my	 59.9466635171481
temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride	 349.50351400941065
and conceit. Unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only _child_)	 668.4366701153158
I was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father	 149.49727719670992
particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,	 606.3791389588156
almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond	 79.60288861615554
my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to	 39.019780301620074
_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with	 139.5439560105586
my own. Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might	 830.5324730570154
still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not	 717.1024699429237
owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most	 183.85903610776916
advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a	 92.10939893988107
doubt of my reception. You shewed me how insufficient were all my	 446.58125159010206
pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased."	 118.2858632294121
"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?"	 458.7253670058534
"Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be	 79.30540402458668
wishing, expecting my addresses."	 946.5074170150252
"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally I assure you.	 85.07739485295114
I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.	 167.3417863571988
How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?"	 97.84258584246155
"Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take	 612.1668834023012
a proper direction."	 171.65937540760314
"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at	 162.81155434160016
Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?"	 341.46439965885236
"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise."	 330.6394772674921
"Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.	 152.77699015032096
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I	 99.146981481707
confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due."	 98.41154009431264
"My object _then_," replied Darcy, "was to shew you, by every civility	 177.07464164558206
in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped	 92.29373893635321
to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you	 40.05446619727031
see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes	 140.22683797172613
introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an	 144.8065151233121
hour after I had seen you."	 178.55432401741464
He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her	 76.19667021455251
disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to	 1541.6798035712072
the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of	 313.12103638230946
following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed	 114.61446233186132
before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness	 46.43806301130818
there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must	 162.50996324440183
comprehend.	 3558.4256692449226
She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to	 259.39177669327455
each, to be dwelt on farther.	 172.74277959643547
After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know	 104.17206111919383
any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that	 54.44404962014859
it was time to be at home.	 30.33944690346194
"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!" was a wonder which	 78.42626357427753
introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs. Darcy was delighted with	 36.536590580407676
their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of	 101.91593735281391
it.	 110.84070322522837
"I must ask whether you were surprised?" said Elizabeth.	 108.33915571618208
"Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen."	 88.56233762080844
"That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much." And	 66.41431384121398
though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much	 94.01297690225607
the case.	 82.0425113139262
"On the evening before my going to London," said he "I made a confession	 101.69098818714556
to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told him of	 45.08938479489599
all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs,	 97.26357321800023
absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had the	 168.39276688169775
slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself	 132.92787791500842
mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent	 216.0627419316264
to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was	 53.787778836266156
unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together."	 73.13680840407594
Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his	 72.0945512862358
friend.	 810.5019387089804
"Did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you told him	 143.2992592347498
that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?"	 1134.3437877395384
"From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits	 72.06010112091904
which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection."	 110.65933561945516
"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to	 3121.8273748605147
him."	 219.2887829078639
"It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had	 228.17922081807396
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but	 58.9067165876731
his reliance on mine, made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess	 274.0170300933671
one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not	 243.4819817579951
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months	 163.38522176025978
last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was	 229.5285095636076
angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained	 198.06744520389108
in any doubt of your sister's sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me	 191.94448358862752
now."	 947.0226211139804
Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful	 40.397214085476655
friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked	 71.93456842215309
herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it	 51.22478393638551
was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley,	 169.7070884292784
which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the	 69.257526772515
conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they parted.	 102.11170249776569
CHAPTER XVII.	 12.911953956184709
"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?" was a question	 103.02851760788221
which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and	 24.118580148793562
from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in	 46.48508405756911
reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own	 94.60316071559623
knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing	 207.2623603613805
else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.	 51.75893271709088
The evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary. The	 51.70908031580037
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.	 634.0064743912208
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;	 130.00516224182144
and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy,	 70.99494326587684
than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,	 425.0290574788949
there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in	 172.83122405495715
the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one	 181.74753838961178
liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a	 128.06734556808937
_dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.	 275.27302272651616
At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far	 94.38030269684351
from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.	 107.07432538970163
"You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!--engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,	 106.09464153760497
you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible."	 27.639602359292827
"This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and	 260.3100176169973
I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am	 58.71557976527099
in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are	 114.10922217984591
engaged."	 3064.9961984302213
Jane looked at her doubtingly. "Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much	 50.86290868481103
you dislike him."	 1461.6184981552942
"You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I	 38.01210454389815
did not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as these,	 61.735282944764315
a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever	 143.1010740000681
remember it myself."	 549.8153500866049
Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more	 143.7273315083109
seriously assured her of its truth.	 614.3928674507555
"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you," cried	 230.81505164635755
Jane. "My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you	 53.30199017145063
certain? forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be	 136.5387468713808
happy with him?"	 397.5700408036688
"There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that	 85.03605741008894
we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased,	 32.973923118940824
Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?"	 104.21281226181513
"Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more	 686.2615028155681
delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you	 210.56459438405508
really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do any thing rather than	 279.2400929108968
marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought	 197.39744132481124
to do?"	 109.08783820197782
"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I	 44.01527746300256
tell you all."	 180.83785923764088
"What do you mean?"	 11.341085731154976
"Why, I must confess, that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am	 97.57777360622549
afraid you will be angry."	 234.9927765893916
"My dearest sister, now _be_ be serious. I want to talk very seriously.	 280.34502937909286
Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell	 86.17570560232893
me how long you have loved him?"	 131.15953901657198
"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.	 79.54795091920133
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds	 111.15982658931911
at Pemberley."	 85.64501551847167
Another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the	 350.4845694586285
desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of	 192.85493833706758
attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing	 266.63969176304323
farther to wish.	 344.23694440188825
"Now I am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself. I	 58.83469446900811
always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I	 227.3459220127874
must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your	 425.795296160459
husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But	 460.7969013022763
Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you	 83.05002435087387
tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know	 119.82531092759616
of it, to another, not to you."	 149.14239696962545
Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to	 35.539255771738176
mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made	 70.34435795628461
her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer	 151.95629289114183
conceal from her, his share in Lydia's marriage. All was acknowledged,	 391.371274093847
and half the night spent in conversation.	 394.2940599387527
"Good gracious!" cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next	 80.56481747764215
morning, "if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with	 454.2862360138042
our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always	 132.7015773124244
coming here? I had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or	 161.20574473254086
other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?	 205.3860301661223
Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's	 100.23429662434651
way."	 1233.7906066166584
Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet	 67.22484137916624
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an	 100.59102525388914
epithet.	 8.776652323334677
As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and	 48.30324487177558
shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;	 379.79675246654034
and he soon afterwards said aloud, "Mr. Bennet, have you no more lanes	 91.61028230548801
hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?"	 303.51730845430694
"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs. Bennet, "to walk	 82.55508538275879
to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has	 37.66998317655175
never seen the view."	 275.2456917881402
"It may do very well for the others," replied Mr. Bingley; "but I am	 68.03962704438901
sure it will be too much for Kitty. Wont it, Kitty?"	 102.345753760352
Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great	 116.73639947230532
curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently	 64.6226939394407
consented. As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her,	 126.3467214830585
saying,	 3877.7670626999984
"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that	 39.326728850981375
disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is	 49.75043204130504
all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to	 64.08827934454811
him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to	 237.00593485713537
inconvenience."	 8.776652323334677
During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be	 79.97350551942728
asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the	 30.075807514357354
application for her mother's. She could not determine how her mother	 112.96399668494364
would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur	 131.2064555624129
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she	 80.00285544715074
were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it	 187.97158822843133
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to	 65.178325975749
her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the	 63.977768543699526
first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her	 171.77310728065063
disapprobation.	 2702.745476052596
In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw	 51.015244742021444
Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was	 84.64883667211632
extreme. She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to	 43.500415651055285
be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that _she_,	 160.86120245332825
his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be	 185.81791363883912
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched	 54.7021929808962
reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,	 338.53048364100573
looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes	 48.003262917753176
he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while	 59.71862351886142
pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he	 102.75541604087474
wants you in the library." She was gone directly.	 177.9831160172096
Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.	 130.4179440408958
"Lizzy," said he, "what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be	 82.78924022655355
accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?"	 154.01273857858712
How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more	 157.56025143462807
reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from	 273.2221583302622
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;	 43.423538063434634
but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of	 111.19533689862509
her attachment to Mr. Darcy.	 47.400801989899975
"Or in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be	 127.58521463017894
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.	 394.39235339556245
But will they make you happy?"	 650.0752726317797
"Have you any other objection," said Elizabeth, "than your belief of my	 166.32945894729082
indifference?"	 2906.1670813512224
"None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but	 320.6603673916132
this would be nothing if you really liked him."	 137.73508716754827
"I do, I do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "I love him.	 123.94160938720705
Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not	 49.46273946827576
know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in	 61.56228660953758
such terms."	 206.6645853587912
"Lizzy," said her father, "I have given him my consent. He is the kind	 54.336125042569755
of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse any thing, which he	 162.0068177612597
condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on	 146.95632455728102
having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your	 122.21312708746908
disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor	 128.04693792955638
respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked	 7044.135540446804
up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the	 248.89232163283057
greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape	 506.69804374536915
discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing	 90.39953680689362
_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are	 143.71663522770717
about."	 749.577483952026
Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;	 143.67752751607102
and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the	 111.08167996723783
object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her	 130.36721536570303
estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that	 54.16909514305697
his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many	 56.52858582745826
months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she	 56.96226509478256
did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.	 68.27404040318707
"Well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "I have no more to	 46.31749607034395
say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with	 133.2557953269771
you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy."	 333.14534811360033
To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy	 150.124013314264
had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.	 123.72719792763257
"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing;	 80.65097821542312
made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him	 178.36217605283647
his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble	 135.2469943063119
and economy. Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ have	 200.74014704857913
paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own	 507.82150348514807
way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about	 62.07166899727993
his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter."	 79.08688963664835
He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading	 152.04850285577285
Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her	 87.21498254462834
at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, "If any young men come	 85.39369792919034
for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure."	 697.8824697775132
Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after	 103.11563035445785
half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join	 73.32403143108083
the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for	 118.33808624744759
gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any	 51.06806612292853
thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity	 173.64789061791117
would come in time.	 163.41057557986184
When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,	 95.40547318392676
and made the important communication. Its effect was most	 690.6585408703767
extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and	 1148.606074292692
unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes, that	 169.99677400386219
she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to	 101.88219888168682
credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the	 131.27416610177895
shape of a lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to	 29.53236478909402
fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless	 269.63511065667325
herself.	 374.1154146567428
"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would	 179.11063293526942
have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich	 428.0191201349311
and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages	 187.9034446585522
you will have! Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so	 74.12606652960557
pleased--so happy. Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my	 178.11779328734022
dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I	 79.09977125554201
hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing	 114.65150496542562
that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,	 328.96546618640946
Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted."	 124.64305041141066
This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and	 135.6702756014084
Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,	 77.08858400997661
soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,	 103.23693248654682
her mother followed her.	 107.26990531205227
"My dearest child," she cried, "I can think of nothing else! Ten	 203.24623862743513
thousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a Lord! And a	 151.04468022405916
special licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But	 51.47248104060055
my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of,	 145.2747732446929
that I may have it to-morrow."	 152.0962102520711
This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman	 40.26788192126075
himself might be; and Elizabeth found, that though in the certain	 117.23477344723868
possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations'	 108.6501346198467
consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow	 35.87585135970536
passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood	 215.16151535007768
in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak	 82.29248750048232
to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark	 82.58168153676294
her deference for his opinion.	 56.469322061747484
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get	 66.19240326630685
acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising	 28.234208078422817
every hour in his esteem.	 362.92743284077943
"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he. "Wickham, perhaps,	 537.2016637825927
is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well	 155.33756068131513
as Jane's."	 257.01526080046716
CHAPTER XVIII.	 12.911953956184709
Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.	 93.84530532299812
Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. "How could	 74.34074907103012
you begin?" said she. "I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when	 82.19343824580795
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first	 155.3211281933908
place?"	 1798.4721437783696
"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which	 199.91608372502142
laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I	 27.11689475211885
knew that I _had_ begun."	 100.42773631223125
"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour	 229.66389862928088
to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke	 93.05386964987727
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere;	 538.1351152528287
did you admire me for my impertinence?"	 377.1925184373636
"For the liveliness of your mind, I did."	 41.28608983969699
"You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.	 247.3117750541944
The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious	 47.11718845930784
attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking	 214.78563342327473
and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused, and	 518.8110891810953
interested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really	 269.61555959320003
amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you	 33.74051833573669
took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and	 983.5378459252704
in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously	 128.36700612239937
courted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;	 39.5936239181442
and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly	 399.96496848983725
reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks	 63.170680741466825
of _that_ when they fall in love."	 72.05565836052062
"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was	 299.90431137403226
ill at Netherfield?"	 452.5789644606527
"Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it	 271.8181387148524
by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are	 58.72935331967511
to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me	 31.532163946671005
to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may	 120.35937609591355
be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling	 409.77995292863966
to come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first	 103.96534345461895
called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did	 2431.931384310482
you look as if you did not care about me?"	 61.89381076584429
"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement."	 167.61332340723905
"But I was embarrassed."	 26.50431429121083
"And so was I."	 259.3428605532653
"You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner."	 109.394753065951
"A man who had felt less, might."	 211.50954591314598
"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that	 53.04821401549154
I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you	 21.747036927479066
_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when	 109.9148551121222
you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of	 179.6877839269302
thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. _Too	 358.5213042194221
much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort	 171.34685209534706
springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the	 82.11798174655387
subject? This will never do."	 359.42320256477825
"You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady	 138.91264560809904
Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us, were the means of	 67.53078205817866
removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to	 42.21369949060612
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to	 194.72585914586685
wait for any opening of your's. My aunt's intelligence had given me	 280.8069134534366
hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing."	 59.92789534704062
"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,	 111.47120747607033
for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to	 81.32821205205762
Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?	 122.31247346306918
or had you intended any more serious consequence?"	 563.2378890727476
"My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I	 161.61499210260345
might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to	 151.8535259112473
myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley,	 322.05720685113545
and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made."	 73.31726191624959
"Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine, what is to	 89.23790694413516
befall her?"	 25.673099276579286
"I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth. But it ought to	 176.27379164083007
be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done	 23.98692636426059
directly."	 2867.1585406385684
"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and	 67.78663958691443
admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But	 615.6983121258488
I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected."	 267.83881776172916
From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy	 97.78358271173869
had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner's	 81.48331328979074
long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would	 302.7413317749173
be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt	 56.17200980418674
had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as	 643.2363843741205
follows:	 8.776652323334677
"I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have	 27.328811017427896
done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but	 362.4164347973204
to say the truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than	 182.29994670063036
really existed. But _now_ suppose as much as you chuse; give a	 172.97222851102396
loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible	 55.868576646248265
flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me	 127.7331811137279
actually married, you cannot greatly err. You must write again very	 267.8817657614618
soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last. I	 146.89851455854662
thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes. How could I	 115.15062465061438
be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful.	 88.97122365787196
We will go round the Park every day. I am the happiest creature in	 94.85423648093541
the world. Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one	 396.95444171906377
with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I	 549.6713645489571
laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world, that he can	 50.354605814271906
spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.	 64.33040444596863
Your's, &c."	 79.3466902163023
Mr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine, was in a different style; and	 58.331999798722904
still different from either, was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in	 195.95370035287024
reply to his last.	 227.72660125681242
"DEAR SIR,	 117.4245714297951
"I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will	 439.66055870588735
soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as	 150.60376113665046
you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has	 148.33248782698772
more to give.	 163.88718963597103
"Your's sincerely, &c."	 1424.0008421986488
Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching	 48.3073475208286
marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even	 184.44469325424961
to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her	 51.83041717801518
former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was	 128.65549909227303
affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing	 196.6004419759307
her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.	 167.42460577074277
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was	 362.66611874163846
as sincere as her brother's in sending it. Four sides of paper were	 181.27977257412562
insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of	 108.06290923438576
being loved by her sister.	 313.1964250701528
Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations	 80.93540820082288
to Elizabeth, from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the	 104.35510022979489
Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge. The reason of this sudden	 271.97106988801323
removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so	 92.2086208286187
exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that	 70.68100000389322
Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till	 108.88741314348435
the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend	 54.74061378721522
was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their	 85.41789583270702
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she	 132.77143756041758
saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her	 24.752122905664464
husband. He bore it however with admirable calmness. He could even	 98.13396073726877
listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away	 68.64258968058024
the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all	 38.79661551472842
meeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure. If he did	 91.36078754259447
shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.	 33.77863238752386
Mrs. Philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his	 106.86141111774575
forbearance; and though Mrs. Philips, as well as her sister, stood in	 67.0363776922018
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good	 82.6396619292222
humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.	 560.1868354020052
Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all	 93.85580298279002
likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could, to shield	 133.27594482871183
him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him	 102.2523112412783
to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse	 46.189143621295116
without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising	 97.10942496479156
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it	 119.65492276724996
added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to	 59.82140277768494
the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to	 139.75775688902016
either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at	 111.5657712666494
Pemberley.	 849.0723879754619
CHAPTER XIX.	 12.911953956184709
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got	 170.91589221257337
rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she	 285.8812106209387
afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley and talked of Mrs. Darcy may be guessed.	 114.22262011034003
I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment	 26.79558450893824
of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children,	 82.44085134814328
produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable,	 371.39253667221874
well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was	 44.34663398785196
lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in	 75.69948654156771
so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and	 251.15475009625175
invariably silly.	 326.9153685369923
Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her	 59.79066349831328
drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do. He delighted in	 197.7533236719727
going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.	 229.60135199751008
Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near	 73.49356218779306
a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to	 330.52605814835573
_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his	 450.45374611773354
sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county	 201.18283072723864
to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source	 153.91979078460915
of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.	 68.8312863985353
Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with	 374.15191632514507
her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally	 1015.6601957640706
known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a	 128.73677394053357
temper as Lydia, and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she	 138.30318294785036
became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less	 946.242290136068
ignorant, and less insipid. From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's	 112.81154877207925
society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham	 150.46353090649072
frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of	 94.58116063827212
balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.	 101.94709472672147
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily	 55.28814310175055
drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet's being quite	 73.30471432067075
unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but	 210.65580444191977
she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no	 131.6373665391133
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own,	 118.893900410831
it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without	 116.08004066606554
much reluctance.	 67.33447946128746
As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from	 230.3639602933831
the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that	 41.71478176845307
Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude	 89.57961536241582
and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every	 56.1306409800798
thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on	 176.9251732299829
to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received	 125.05645318187648
from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,	 230.87424683800796
if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this	 229.57882633341268
effect:	 75756.53957543163
"MY DEAR LIZZY,	 24.472178818087478
"I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear	 98.17064154436733
Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you	 54.2967209720245
so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will	 26.86069584615723
think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very	 117.48486946087175
much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live	 75.28234284961702
upon without some help. Any place would do, of about three or four	 837.2702987833366
hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it,	 46.61431401475237
if you had rather not.	 80.36595207705109
"Yours, &c."	 79.3466902163023
As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in	 243.04789930558866
her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind.	 72.08494484976853
Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice	 41.29639635771336
of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she	 79.39609716559569
frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an	 225.53519779706352
income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in	 115.42074663226809
their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to	 132.6323455622539
their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or	 683.7769096888945
herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance	 223.40715995456262
towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the	 180.24572634336502
restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the	 28.750856589463933
extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap	 119.23265346364545
situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for	 133.19085264451178
her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in	 159.76240504645475
spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to	 68.23052993653695
reputation which her marriage had given her.	 49.89748944976271
Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for	 185.37884890063256
Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession. Lydia was	 177.03685275642414
occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself	 292.3713724242409
in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently	 204.9918158999211
staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he	 930.1403485430475
proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone.	 55.95647101309116
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she	 47.34098261628413
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she	 51.39258746856652
dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as	 211.72140187287965
attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility	 287.0658348066546
to Elizabeth.	 79.5684113664603
Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters	 125.6185631567407
was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each	 193.7154332035076
other, even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion	 204.32479160973412
in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an	 74.47428581778453
astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of	 391.95021929450604
talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect	 124.77090689086587
which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open	 152.8420907846945
pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in	 324.3960007713549
her way. By Elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a	 106.93009996621156
woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not	 188.13782379659537
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.	 250.10653794954095
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;	 41.983732123169844
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in	 22.360644839817578
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him	 285.4467361185961
language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time	 108.8311240252081
all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion,	 413.44552299863346
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;	 37.19662722357849
and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her	 64.39100312737007
resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity	 145.04760097866648
to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on	 45.13549382773834
them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had	 125.16615129219146
received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the	 81.13994529821869
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.	 12.141675420172012
With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy,	 184.69717731291615
as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever	 258.8068333805811
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing	 312.30642676981324
her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.	 62.84102348598697
