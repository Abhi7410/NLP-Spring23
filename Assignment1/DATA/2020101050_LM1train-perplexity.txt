jane with such dreadful news it cannot be concealed from any one my	 3.8970574699008362
view of the house with weary ancles dirty stockings and a face	 5.955679287250502
thousand pounds all connection between us seemed now dissolved i	 3.043937949897872
was a most humiliating pictureand to the pang of a friend disgracing	 4.3495404096822
to send her away and there are several of the young men too that she	 3.563518062455181
afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately	 3.9291665256651047
elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedlyand after an awkward pause	 3.230494562696847
something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to	 4.32625869342699
and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike	 5.197219818395463
say that he was at rosings	 4.561120092989354
daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship	 3.725249268224347
wickham and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr darcys	 4.229014428748127
a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stoodthe sort of	 4.217025756582539
expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own	 3.1817994545253043
he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down	 3.410253326893148
him after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged with	 3.90804981852717
madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some	 4.5451586214540445
looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile in a few minutes	 4.05482698513816
which he would have thought necessary	 3.8891386343752727
pardon me for interrupting you madam cried mr collins but if she	 3.45072368505439
it was a journey of only twentyfour miles and they began it so early	 3.2930127101831
what did you say of me that i did not deserve for though your	 4.675695815887482
interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as	 3.619262190251451
what an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was	 3.61412007362355
they talked of his sister his friends his house his fruit of every	 4.001853884451954
meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that	 4.2568891210465845
repaid	 1.962759145445629
established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorised by such	 3.277994564827773
them but so it is it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted	 4.315086020173551
subject of tenderness than of pride his sense of her inferiorityof	 3.6867841361657283
possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we	 3.3349065464238445
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon	 2.7575181339886243
other even as well as they intended georgiana had the highest opinion	 3.956008421767598
to a ragout had nothing to say to her	 3.7647090208431346
utterly unknown to her before something he supposed might be attributed	 3.3342161528805097
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions when this was	 4.376694906025874
there was certainly at this moment in elizabeths mind a more gentle	 3.058083518362066
will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange	 4.256218547121346
with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected it was	 3.2311829038897564
themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the	 3.2743101324814603
she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over	 3.8978673079806905
gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him	 4.549730447046493
esteemed and valuedthat even wickham had allowed him merit as a	 3.4653499698617023
wentand there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to	 4.225608046594149
up he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as	 5.450237777257391
not yet learnt to condemn themwith respect to that other more	 3.753654385757485
saw any thing of it to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle	 3.996862926243297
moved mr jones says we must not think of moving her we must trespass	 4.32811768916991
his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not	 3.2553574457263683
another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his	 4.1088569588201524
yes almost every day	 3.643172698416331
insolent girl said elizabeth to herselfyou are much mistaken if	 3.3655537923386207
the tumult of elizabeths mind was allayed by this conversation she had	 4.191936960911967
as welcome to me as either of them	 3.3160497741464163
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune	 3.0251898980835272
brother for talking such nonsense	 3.515423728779066
her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist	 3.8654562599483753
would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart but to be sure	 3.7835792852794587
will believe me the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent	 3.9027474989975923
satisfactory to tell you mr bingley does not know the whole of his	 3.2807139310778477
are satisfied	 3.936143596309681
pure and elevating passion i should at present detest his very name	 3.9312357671496505
useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small	 3.274262841324242
oh yesthe handsomest young lady that ever was seen and so	 2.9494822169111385
disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that	 4.030059648844596
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from	 3.219172809454745
carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably	 3.913895119375435
not at all	 2.8657754472708743
immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could	 3.200076772196037
trouble of saying as little as possible	 3.2564137522866226
i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully	 3.347788175325946
think of nothing but of mr wickham and of what he had told her all	 4.300978899157155
the house as ever i saw he simpers and smirks and makes love to us	 4.4993507424590895
respectable man who had for many years the management of all the	 4.202523272143435
gained her point and had time to consider of it her reflections were	 3.518114499144868
it	 2.9808394092207244
the whole party in the liveliest spirits	 4.047156776986731
of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted	 3.4969121996046253
affection than she feels bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he	 3.9763143751284393
be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparisonbut	 4.2518593136176
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady	 5.140673664022577
she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of	 3.694880772941487
instantly met and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest	 4.258472652107936
whether all her sisters were at longbourn there was not much in the	 4.139884281438792
say in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself	 4.359752849123838
i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his	 4.108602538645781
obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour	 3.3638184380050635
understand it i shall then give over every expectation every wish of	 3.2203324559124176
approach and before she could strike into another path she was	 3.8431675934060836
on each side with the utmost politeness mr darcy handed the ladies	 4.147470310772954
from the time of year all field sports were over within doors there	 3.8052354089143106
during your stay at lambton	 3.5568580610413174
to be mentioned in your hearing that is his notion of christian	 3.3532370083869347
oh my dear mr bennet as she entered the room we have had a most	 3.374850646915222
while	 3.7628297316462564
or two when i last saw her she was not very promising i am very glad	 4.109845420731127
outside the united states us laws alone swamp our small staff	 3.282649536114497
to oakham mount this morning it is a nice long walk and mr darcy has	 4.58337909334344
and her children should go to london at the same time that mr bennet	 3.531918720146997
than any other person	 4.188157000684662
most disagreeable such were the gentle murmurs of mrs bennet and they	 4.973723169113343
in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a	 4.245905640385514
look on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when	 4.472730640114849
mercenary and she shall be foolish	 3.4520161403527627
intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to	 3.781599480091226
these are not janes feelings she is not acting by design as yet she	 3.7666228791340743
interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with	 3.309572329580295
a haunch the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the	 4.324341470212013
partner for a couple of dances can give the moment of her release from	 4.823252697585121
in your eyes i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life	 3.750449041129438
coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of every	 4.0231152871685

countenance elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first	 3.8052143691844043
home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think	 4.091832804214936
if the same circumstances were to happen again i am sure i should	 3.637491142198623
springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the	 3.5400454165683475
he readily assured her of his secrecyagain expressed his sorrow for	 4.318492161271974
was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was	 3.062720057859247
i beg your pardonone knows exactly what to think	 3.4812226988133856
miss lucas was odious to her as her successor in that house she	 4.830350885833594
jane shook her head	 3.5340055271349597
father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the	 3.644251969891223
the first class	 2.8352459765422138
and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful	 4.632627154198181
house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally	 4.560449263564345
melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings to rosings he then	 3.2562450233313216
there is no danger of wickhams marrying mary king theres for you she	 3.896871782089402
redistribution	 1.962759145445629
for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an	 4.294050356432816
nothing	 3.1905193505140135
his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bennet his marriage was	 3.555142645728444
were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been	 3.42429005954862
were to meet us at the church well monday morning came and i was in	 4.178112786205988
feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily	 3.5198997248103354
catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a	 3.892007885704311
feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been	 3.27252251147009
copying distributing performing displaying or creating derivative	 2.994539851555441
they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of	 4.376800057181752
attempt to place him in an amiable light i am not equal to it wickham	 4.245703768411487
an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr	 4.515150123395346
very greatly to my happiness and thirdlywhich perhaps i ought to have	 3.322189205846888
this will not do said elizabeth you never will be able to make both	 3.8433383670838746
opinion her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more	 4.761923005847376
on these occasions mrs gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeths	 4.967386363482571
himself was no very difficult point to persuade him against	 3.262898659513909
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise	 3.6966076079273567
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partneryou	 3.582144083722804
had been too ingenious for her on opening the door she perceived her	 3.613680154697109
when at length they arose to take leave mrs bennet was most pressingly	 4.115246297108327
hopeless it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that	 3.746878820150071
had ventured only one glance at darcy he looked serious as usual and	 3.346862729093666
for the indulgence of some music miss bingley moved with alacrity to	 4.587493779536682
have passed within ten miles of us colonel forster gives us reason	 3.275519452362745
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in	 3.4079486413153095
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however	 3.7600029663144774
not adequate to the risk	 3.7478535504000754
magnitude you last night laid to my charge the first mentioned	 3.6240343331252176
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour as for	 4.341717584661148
their intending to go off had colonel forster seen denny himself	 3.110846743702923
was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had	 4.296911389851191
think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements	 3.205975850734766
kept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went	 4.510501008539322
neighbours in meryton	 3.8993086896887457
dont think me angry however for i only mean to let you know	 3.150517395088384
she urged jane to borrow mr bingleys carriage immediately and at	 3.756961206277077
certainly did not hate him no hatred had vanished long ago and she	 4.441152767493809
good heavens cried elizabeth but how could that behow could	 3.2890659774751563
objectionable if they believed him attached to me they would not try	 4.126470857420115
elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after	 3.9303512230303435
necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she	 3.3156284144878194
elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection	 3.292925079236501
and lydia but while they were supported by their mothers indulgence	 3.472142470509475
delight	 4.104371038948838
in which you have been brought up	 3.996277692060593
bingley was uncivil to her and more teazing than usual to himself	 4.333883081148936
me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could	 3.8185264542178703
pleasantest preservative from want this preservative she had now	 4.219249371451567
they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and	 5.018564260664847
i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility mr darcy would	 3.6294556858880243
mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of	 3.1866286011811056
by exclamations and inquiries about the other of whom however she	 4.722531337638659
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters	 3.421844287825118
of any bodys children it should not be of my own however	 4.227426281108385
subject this will never do	 3.6278105319247387
affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for	 3.2349427081692643
excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay	 3.581117745439719
compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing	 3.6965275677381655
acquaintance but that is all i have nothing either to hope or fear	 3.740123658880404
make any reply mary however continued to console herself with such	 3.736763111200163
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their raptures	 3.155391532772542
very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds	 3.178694592262121
hoped that by carolines not living in the same house with her brother	 3.8877117846494817
she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that	 3.233099766830186
bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy	 3.692746544742548
what do you think she said besides ah mrs bennet we shall have her	 3.2306857652114567
being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in	 3.1117054721224653
jane i congratulate you you will be a very happy woman	 4.5892975302770544
them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are	 3.4439552674437857
uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the	 4.441557147099951
question and read on at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be	 4.073943464533062
as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business	 3.344049332157011
literary archive foundation	 3.0271889137682306
convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said	 4.134849766202011
his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the	 3.9505326812991624
her you have a sweet room here mr bingley and a charming prospect	 4.186357832154191
out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me	 4.087838009248176
likely to be in this country much longer	 4.759602909923059
wanted to counteract her mothers schemes	 3.385225806921404
professor michael s hart was the originator of the project gutenbergtm	 3.957292832851484
elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on her briefly	 3.9390672535126967
of which prudence forbad the disclosure she dared not relate the other	 4.242177766563245
therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent	 4.087619368550055
furniture in vain mr gardiner highly amused by the kind of family	 3.8439663247213636
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit	 4.600278964959621
mr bennet replied that he had not	 3.690227287246085
of his friend for though jane had the most generous and forgiving	 4.006987396824135
husbands love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their	 3.7291815179008125
talking of why he has four or five thousand ayear and very likely	 3.4916007196248153
if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know	 3.477422383934274
county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three	 4.741891488175443
you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your	 3.8820397629636654
mr wickhams attention was caught and after observing mr collins for	 4.392131729331837
from her mothers apartment immediately met her	 3.616737300002138
walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her	 4.745445320541939
it places mr darcy to be treating his fathers favourite in such a	 4.231842957963936
he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them	 3.6104815084046504
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from	 3.8987671957806658
knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mr	 4.684360462023487
i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon	 4.396459828940922
by the servants account that their niece was taken suddenly illbut	 3.0862133283769
who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i	 4.651333838998393
himself at netherfield such amiable qualities must speak for	 3.226053551210094
go she represented to him all the improprieties of lydias general	 5.913792680364433
when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go	 3.4656323165813094
idle certainly might	 3.418364118289356
so strong an affection but his pride his abominable pride his	 3.3983846758775074
for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter and his	 3.566713176066574
scruple to call out	 3.403813804898839
lost	 4.302559928087879
ought to have i should think you could not do better but as it isyou	 4.236585559698647
and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice	 4.206227140878445
him capable of it	 3.6544123265544552
makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will	 3.7292311298358696
this though i doubt whether his reserve or anybodys	 3.4334111535512934
interrupted him with	 3.180949007915479
bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away	 3.7097527984070897
acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly	 3.84487765553046
eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it he added that mr	 4.976772939272082
governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have	 3.356534200506595
then getting up walked about the room elizabeth was surprised but said	 3.3377532733570447
the first exclamations of surprise and horror mr gardiner readily	 3.445940829526146
on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the	 5.468670400137817
exceedingly fair lady lucas began directly to calculate with more	 3.9716235758666882
attachment to rosings certainly increases	 3.3743571319246497
elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of	 3.7840868167444697
with you	 3.8179042409673216
mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then	 3.2839513166261605
moment or are the result of previous study	 3.5623174532252073
very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying	 3.3412338208090104
came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects	 3.3458830224106246
not very differently engaged	 4.134685690912533
the housekeeper came a respectablelooking elderly woman much less	 3.851175727933525
and that i suppose is one of your sisters	 3.6866300236055283
so doing	 3.969084304696233
feelings appear what they were not it was necessary to laugh when she	 3.7568527350997596
especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing	 3.229592035538027
ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great	 3.9924206317747974
listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre	 3.7359026222594496
their plan and would not give his real opinion about it he did not	 3.91467461384129
feel it	 3.3736949638474405
a voice which proved it to be mr darcy she moved again towards the	 4.106811625949522
thing in his power to satisfy us on this head but on second thoughts	 3.4241487793201157
you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy	 3.36787253989906
was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached	 5.103977296967656
unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be	 3.2210463301817938
determined to make enquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible	 3.307944696453941
approaching them and at no great distance the walk being here less	 3.2261026656071534
very very much nothing could give either bingley or myself more	 3.237596399576965
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health	 4.313831557915431
afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr darcys	 3.949678797876978
had known any thing of the matter	 3.6985465263460937
their father and motherwhen they get to our age i dare say they will	 3.701535819891181
her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of	 4.571984917364197
a friendly eye	 3.6927716557921197
friendship and affection a regard for the requester would often make	 4.000746517339035
in paragraph 1f3 this work is provided to you asis with no other	 5.356948755327627
could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing	 4.544944681518162
avoiding mrs bennet as much as possible saying not much to elizabeth	 3.6092229032417698
soon went away but before she had been three minutes in her own room	 3.7382837985890127
affronted by their advice and lydia selfwilled and careless would	 4.852162740250335
returns of the delightful intercourse we have known and in the mean	 3.807885774983877
reached the carriage mr and mrs gardiner were half a quarter of a	 4.128624933143684
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe	 3.961136967962113
gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her	 3.9761428534019005
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying though he had	 3.4237304683381833
afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your	 4.896130854890133
if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he chuses	 3.6704776911412567
receive a refund of the money if any you paid for it by sending a	 4.438514196698142
after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows	 3.486643553623723
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to	 3.5501901118819603
exaggeration the shocking rudeness of mr darcy	 3.1296394276437582
lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been	 3.906022190185584
entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he	 3.699644628050903
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had	 3.3790379456887125
would rather have cried her father had most cruelly mortified her by	 4.726205971502988
and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own	 5.103176776264988
engaged by wickham for those very dancesand to have mr collins	 3.889649976951061
gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing	 3.982287210619761
lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her	 3.303481377145185
bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations elizabeth	 3.9789804599409124
a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece while these	 3.2968389918607355
you have a very small park here returned lady catherine after a short	 2.931536448312385
and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously	 3.3599997818158207
delight in vexing me you have no compassion on my poor nerves	 3.4564716660558745
he then asked her to walk into the housebut she declared herself not	 4.142829997399131
it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who	 3.9349910888978243
with the officers cried lydia i wonder my aunt did not tell us of	 3.052051031861241
selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient adieu i	 4.6091367980472935
jane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy	 3.6608148148087074
question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner	 5.179317134428671
often talk of it between themselves well if they can be easy with an	 3.248095429923292
of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness	 3.6183752613663644
any indelicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where	 5.03011695366777
either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying	 3.365075370681964
be as light as a feather	 3.2742944244233474
reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only	 3.305187707867583
to darcy	 3.9299720824372817
vexation her coming there was the most unfortunate the most illjudged	 3.897490609023309
but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the	 3.969135223546414
this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by	 3.9449876231254275
trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on	 5.370352203296817
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on	 3.572709944571673
while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not	 3.387575542802216
elizabeth was distressed she felt that she had no business at	 4.034804132967595
all for janes sake you know and there is no occasion for talking to	 3.627900334938863
of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of	 3.5322181730327835
be written to all their friends in lambton with false excuses for their	 4.009669232228483
i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole	 3.2585999367601457
him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him	 3.0823696388323363
receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost	 4.603608636171551
another very welcome surprise for his chief wish at present was to	 3.2126119378772144
attention the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire lest she	 3.674092955355536
make way for her and live to see her take my place in it	 3.5417069353856485
ladyships indignation would have been what would she have saidhow	 4.250732129938198
spare you for another fortnight	 3.1912367286943137
the evening passed quietly unmarked by any thing extraordinary the	 3.918796094170179
and i certainly never shall give it i am not to be intimidated into	 3.806098258088436
to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival of jane no look appeared	 3.9754513499355157
lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good	 4.217228085286246
and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him	 3.699603422230079
lydias purchases were seated in it	 3.3257802774763996
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could very	 3.7469507383378247
i do not blame jane she continued for jane would have got mr	 3.463248468224296
the country said darcy can in general supply but few subjects for	 3.4455000912415974
might arise in that quarter it distressed her a little and she was	 4.815262368883361

elizabeths congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a	 5.031124595024617
elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from	 3.115260583664842
natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging there is	 6.243823291012496
elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant	 4.364453425211666

immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving	 3.9214107868308896
it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth the	 3.806307389531012
novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such	 3.633728878818471
this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her	 3.2274910033879274

with him i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance	 3.621372454900235
nothing at all mr bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene	 4.149947179709756

last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a	 3.507238167774451

violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it	 3.5698669292083336
mr collins said she speaks highly both of lady catherine and her	 3.2407853294823927

why my dear you must know mrs long says that netherfield is taken	 3.472305221047056

was all done very well she had also to anticipate how her visit would	 3.3459236063139937
without anger such treatment but sir williams good breeding carried	 3.6202997461781017
it is no such thing lydia does not leave me because she is married	 3.2883999297797555
elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained	 3.2340524490045146
mrs bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned	 3.624526188281771

had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as	 3.6470329910502524

feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to	 3.848634837929441
every body away from him and her daughter elizabeth who had a letter	 3.678385977785819
i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation replied	 3.125113355935948

his life	 3.18580687012574
occurred it would be dreadful she blushed at the very idea and	 5.9062160656711935
mrs hurst and her sister allowed it to be sobut still they admired	 4.3152850109511975
that you should come together oh he is the handsomest young man that	 3.807944888306313
this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how	 3.6806681006609963
heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage and had come to	 3.3731289030073164
know	 3.3394297264887673
i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation	 3.2856672394040753
i should be sorry indeed if it were we were always good friends	 3.2648700365271237
they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two	 3.4517544079474747
there had appeared very insufficient and she read it again widely	 4.488410494793257
with what the owner said in its praise and took it immediately	 3.729933335402191
my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express themby which	 4.374373438480916
much but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no	 3.1398098892459885
pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it she	 4.533585952244651
it would be an unpleasant thing	 4.211030012070449
day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he had brought	 3.981656383890108
length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield	 3.5781294572819493
meryton and see how every body went on but elizabeth steadily opposed	 3.463302772862289
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other	 3.3623382144544096
return it	 3.9937774506411636

exactly in unison with her opinion of each	 4.661891535702134
by r w robert william chapman	 4.071900050899815
frequent discussion between her parents elizabeth saw directly that her	 3.7500969325174833
doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady	 4.1031108629659085
i am sure said she i cried for two days together when colonel	 3.127485943761656
on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till	 3.4811820216863856
know whether he would be married in his blue coat	 4.035526182025815
suppose to believe them fond of each other	 3.1715414410356293
you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on	 5.788694234870018
and have you heard from him often	 3.103636157943907
plain vanilla ascii or other format used in the official version	 3.904287943700246
i should be so reasonable as to admit it but i wonder how long you	 4.62524638333046

conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton and the	 3.506202976962822

advantages in my power to offer you will find her manners beyond any	 3.4328075720958795
leaving the diningparlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee	 5.078853824566651
i am afraid mr darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper	 2.9296117669811563
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her she was	 5.194567351470996
hope he will overlook it dear dear lizzy a house in town every thing	 3.5941185124253696
finished it what a letter is this to be written at such a moment but	 3.485142108005486
i desire you will do no such thing lizzy is not a bit better than the	 3.807460026825309
over it immediately it had better have happened to you lizzy you	 3.448288263040734
near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of	 3.401282382691746
written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by mr darcy	 3.2848406101369925
talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the	 5.641059972592269
oh that my dear mother had more command over herself she can have no	 3.4304018277821373
wickham is not so undeserving then as we have thought him said her	 3.854046477667948
sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham	 3.206079581394043
from the drawingroom they could distinguish nothing in the lane and	 3.8075419837918876
regained her composure and calmly replied	 3.2112197940491267
anxious parade walk up to her mothers right hand and hear her say to	 3.345147303569484
yes sir i know i am if i was to go through the world i could not	 3.90528269341219
catherines unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of	 5.0614445654706826
sensibility	 1.962759145445629
can never be what we once were to each other	 3.4487866748487854
	 3.4746791836985214
kindness the day passed most pleasantly away the morning in bustle and	 3.486143382901027
came up with him and eagerly cried out	 3.765988646703861
determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town as mr bennet	 4.32099271499453
gutenbergtm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement	 2.923889702673305
no really replied elizabeth i think there cannot be too little said	 3.630230963162317
through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving mr	 4.04981178111521
while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enoughi	 4.031482922634981
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections	 4.63582941173515
blame you oh no	 3.557460921083186
elizabeth made no answer she was afraid of talking longer of his	 3.0658208449609243
the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her	 4.2188655211120505
detained first by the civility of mr collins whose inquiries after	 3.7079692917197864
down the room together with either of which motives his joining them	 4.138739894279313
she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed	 3.8842412325335998
mr darcythat to be in the same room the same party with him for so	 4.657240456479767
disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind	 4.497574215830016
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings	 4.670900794219187
was so thoughtful	 3.9429502830033596
speculation i will leave him to himself	 3.5050180487615963
again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command she	 3.852047150509996
clothes the wedding clothes i will write to my sister gardiner about	 3.3974977794632717
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no	 3.734562291402335
sister ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to	 4.028290537310455
to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his	 3.7612030279737536

being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend	 3.249788901473223
that	 3.346965003203068
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to	 3.6278277440945867
to hope that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire the day	 2.915096809104253
marry you but when you have had time to think it all over i hope you	 4.001505543677857
compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by	 3.4256271316154767
more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the	 4.208483477367634
since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of	 2.9802154731534864
mrs gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could not	 3.1656737582736914
darcys in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and	 4.064604165094925
soon as she possibly could she was no sooner in possession of it than	 4.964213409167584
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was	 3.266529741556831
did he come at all	 3.3074239084941
ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise	 3.383338885627327
exceedingly well i should have considered it as part of my duty and	 3.8906910340849485
repugnancecauses which though still existing and existing to	 4.203749153223191
should say one of her ladyships carriages for she has several	 4.167961001344247

freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest	 3.4494889636149213
yes i have had a letter from him by express	 3.6033993895621013
when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having	 3.726925549979732
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a	 4.682690470626183
darcys character though he had assured her that respect for the	 3.596701336260923
stranger to the particulars of your youngest sisters infamous	 3.8751388612226743

married i shall have nothing to wish for	 3.8583086652737943
chapter i	 2.8537181665873153
herself his apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were over	 3.7973294348537774
youth as the first and to be kept back on such a motivei think it	 4.116481536619843
of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration the	 3.8543890486742494
but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham	 3.690379458664596
raptures as mr collins expected the scene to inspire and was but	 4.184362726024383
my dear you flatter me i certainly have had my share of beauty but	 3.7758510221276813
no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton	 3.348253122596558

unwillingly said so miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only	 4.201622109669949
the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual	 2.9839522508719263

various recollections connected with him gave her a moments distress	 3.495813376595971

behaviour than her sister	 3.742489713763378
were to entertain each other very little was said by either kitty was	 3.303410115428117
talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying	 3.6896458081881147
greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her	 4.653950585344306
world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for	 5.136081299003912
that they are not gone to scotland	 3.0027806225723754
give me no hope from law a man of honour could not have doubted the	 4.033195328624405
when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that	 4.263145461303932
to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was	 4.009254575510883
thankful that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness	 3.2202876157582665
very young woman and very lately married a resemblance in good humour	 3.9686688018454084

displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us	 3.9776649283195606
i leave it to yourself to determine said mr bennet	 3.726445236757506
particulars immediately following of wickhams resigning all pretensions	 3.516254275164951

observed my friends behaviour attentively and i could then	 4.304312352926829
reason for what she did for mr collins would undoubtedly have been	 3.9644668355073636
has done	 3.5321379049462003
and a book was produced but on beholding it for every thing announced	 3.815582317958601
circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to	 4.2407707998866915
intelligence every day added something to their knowledge of the	 3.3483747176803695
attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother	 4.1895833308823045
bingleys voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold	 4.316747804338563
the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far	 3.1223697095058807
you may depend on it replied the other for mrs nicholls was in	 3.405934666498749
i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer	 2.759441597712938
might arise unpleasant to more than myself	 4.459808524385951
take it on myself	 3.6530436094311862
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of	 4.254669801381354
seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty	 4.181663417452244
true you are a gentlemans daughter but who was your mother who	 3.6852215701696145
she was shewn into the breakfastparlour where all but jane were	 3.8777066319729223
interference in the views of his friend	 4.7339867349474405
for one of youand indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i	 3.8334736757352528
ah sir i do indeed it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you	 4.034103659521913
trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which	 6.458912637380686
that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever	 3.946667216615343
regret what he had thrown away	 4.5945961462416465
indifferent would have prevented his coming down again	 3.5819916350838543
elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin	 3.7243790964089007
dared not lift up her eyes how mr darcy looked therefore she could	 3.5957454267036324
mr wickhams charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could	 3.6012235989405195
yes he introduced us to his sister	 3.631796193079397
elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference	 3.2768045829279617
engaged	 4.128629233320691
her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her	 3.8776598578336015
they were hopeless of remedy her father contented with laughing at	 5.321692387118026
mrs f but no one can throw any blame on them our distress my	 3.3620744786093986
pull it to pieces as soon as i get home and see if i can make it up any	 3.884800964396338
was to speak for itself he called it therefore his duty to step	 3.1118733567591716
lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my room	 3.308857091892958
affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already	 3.6391023477847617
brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate	 3.715017003028825
two young men one has got all the goodness and the other all the	 4.054860434397973
entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the	 4.34786714354406
situation he could conjecture very little about it he must go	 4.164039538171387
him so think it no harm to be off you need not send them word at	 4.00699543041712
my dear sir replied mr collins i am particularly obliged to you	 3.3366406390707337
miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and	 3.970055755736024
fall into it no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have	 3.52100282850079
will you do me the honour of reading that letterand then with a	 3.571501968863304
she had not happened to see mr joness shop boy in the street who had	 4.880124970653328
such premeditation and her intreaty that she would not give into it	 4.331064839542473
owner but surely said she i may enter his county with impunity	 4.6212423873042585
under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof	 3.8152385608007893
delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of	 5.021729626625688
passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too	 4.606348608023093
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingleys good	 5.345674939344383
chapter xix	 1.9070367688535859
mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has	 3.3881481894831706
partiality when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my	 4.134906785140587
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs bennets ill humour or ill	 3.7557999829812476
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the	 3.4706501570092354
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his	 5.319681657242781
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself since her	 4.037936910242932

at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about	 3.5391960691701754
are you thinking are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted	 4.015489990538502
and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to	 4.138472962808514

the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his	 4.058333276760735

were neither formal nor falsely adorned elizabeth was delighted she	 3.6608844408224206
discouraged from speaking again and mr darcys contempt seemed	 3.3193126153778767
instituted by the church of england as a clergyman moreover i	 4.259549632203679

she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of	 5.471073967937198
in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make	 3.2263589669081023
catherine said she you have given me a treasure are any of your	 3.5765570206126753
oh certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really	 4.3294904621335055
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory she was now	 4.564655286342163
or cause to occur a distribution of this or any project gutenbergtm	 4.391662661932025
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood	 3.803113862832606
nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the	 3.3017407047606806
that is very true said elizabeth though it had not occurred to me	 3.215563723500966
well over the agitations of former partiality entirely so she had even	 4.191530585260451
being given on such a point without being resented	 3.4398535895881794
an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to	 3.7356629259751344
all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but little of their spirit	 3.4449488428807507
befall her	 2.596722122633877
perhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought an	 3.8377064140100963
that you were gone into the army and she was afraid hadnot turned	 4.5451732201458395
wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt	 3.52910298403819
and nothing to reproach him with thank god i have not that pain a	 4.286684453416955
them smiles decked the face of mrs bennet as the carriage drove up to	 4.44528023556511
yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of	 3.7918521617033774
explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give	 5.0431195949119
it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself	 3.815704616982944
carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on	 4.631651216648047
i confess said he that i should not have been at all surprised by	 4.1206898701017485
aunt it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he	 3.6648639302334587
this is a parade cried he which does one good it gives such an	 3.2269209627339466
i am not	 2.828354872809451
in the world and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have	 3.2744084927615233
should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to	 3.2276092979556337
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time this was	 5.441156149527767
which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailing she	 4.3486675171994

elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked	 3.8123393439203177
love with only a few days before	 3.8630247399395494
remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself	 4.019086375579701
let me write for you said jane if you dislike the trouble	 3.2289142457502735
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them mr wickham	 3.6981093915774417
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than	 4.19916594751108
brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at	 3.558451939193874
think it will be very tolerable besides it will not much signify what	 4.106993459470254
scruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebuke	 3.8737474346414342
opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind one may be continually	 4.2613522883902055
and permanent future for project gutenbergtm and future generations	 2.890913627105255
that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins	 4.064465554639158
their visit to rosings mr collins was carefully instructing them in	 4.557020025389202
much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be	 3.4447161651197757
and down they ran into the diningroom which fronted the lane in quest	 4.111173038690298
they had been speaking mr bingley and his sisters came to give their	 3.333342317065168
wonder i am truly glad dearest lizzy that you have been spared	 4.011744146157542
i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy	 4.38961063103671
his conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with many	 5.022756067368065
quarter of an hour	 3.637348193125529
we are not in a way to know what mr bingley likes said her mother	 4.077701781842649
when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which	 3.8954456509720794
they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to	 3.805125714356768
lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey	 3.177744607130512
young cousin no ill will and should never resent her behaviour as any	 3.3092451306003765
advantageous by you i was properly humbled i came to you without a	 4.825842808346257
we will go round the park every day i am the happiest creature in	 3.0859249390901686
something for fortune and figure	 3.490484945986156
in parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer	 4.9059377416423136
you keep winking at me for what am i to do	 3.2300643771605237
asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as	 3.761707274545565
oh thoughtless thoughtless lydia cried elizabeth when she had	 2.852466336944274
i beg you would not put it into lizzys head to be vexed by his	 3.6272433374531925
will easily comprehend from these particulars that mr wickhams	 3.3989228085857297
restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a	 4.232169686319957
be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find	 3.8007565902728317
she did not like to go home again so soon she added	 3.4219116162792713
received at first an absolute negative but jane and elizabeth who	 5.150106717575296
themselveswe have tried two or three subjects already without	 3.2087670195404
come here my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room	 3.1526447826596287
speed through the neighbourhood it was borne in the latter with decent	 5.097130446547843
i must ask whether you were surprised said elizabeth	 3.1267866027555677
cousins conduct does not suit my feelings why was he to be the judge	 3.708917692812326
be so beautiful for nothing i remember as soon as ever i saw him when	 3.2626810195407234
farthing less than ten thousand pounds i should be sorry to think so	 3.313885267343465
her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with	 4.202376380458502
i know are all chance in this world there is no knowing how estates	 3.3245868782479047
all intercourse was at an end but at length by elizabeths persuasion	 3.6163311755024976
catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves	 3.5552925355194525
from netherfield and was opened immediately the envelope contained a	 4.293251981492869
such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice	 4.217754399190709
he is indeedbut considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we	 3.68761655206075
help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a	 3.8231183609315464
looking at the picture it is a handsome face but lizzy you can tell	 3.717480472433624
told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter	 3.3130163198983
clothes when i get to longbourn but i wish you would tell sally	 3.7792030502263367
its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means	 4.366318332766362
could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her	 3.611264143455477
chapter xiv	 1.9070367688535859
proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering	 3.8297851418486846
mrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no	 3.5216247985757874
fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as	 3.8398248284850998
longbournhouse elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all sense	 4.217817384548081
doing very well together your tempers are by no means unlike you are	 3.640461535118386
whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to	 3.0970880505369847
another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to	 5.089142687037035
swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance its banks	 3.27686643000309
great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly	 4.237597795387982
accomplishedshe plays and sings all day long in the next room is a	 3.680095265054617
marriage my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of	 3.679606104060592
propriety not a pleasure to himself he seldom appeared really	 3.275642483937984
got pretty near the truth she directly replied	 3.314428235179669
presumption to aspire can never take place no never mr darcy is	 3.420436670115531
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was	 4.269480115305942
how could i ever think her like her nephew said she as she looked in	 3.2619382698459147
money no connections nothing that can tempt him toshe is lost for	 3.6336360551341165
so long in one attitude	 3.752177864597333
affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence	 3.237069191752421
little copse	 2.74961405603543
your examination of mr darcy is over i presume said miss	 4.545372155858348
either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from	 3.633069601482274
terms with any one with whom it had always pleased him to be at	 4.192791661006731
the badbelongs to you alone and so you like this mans sisters too	 3.775840749465564
colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of	 3.3659934159957485
before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if mr bingley	 4.549528502837355
if not by himself such a hope was cherished the letter was to this	 3.9802268033101735
most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the	 4.431981713431721
assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were	 4.3208268794555265
that his manners are thus softened my reproofs at hunsford could not	 3.4312228169243326
estate and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility and	 3.513887750710496
i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age	 3.911711136210696
the inns in barnet and hatfield but without any success no such	 4.737377699024072
you look as if you did not care about me	 3.0225225380849206
after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every	 4.05880426207358

in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy she follows him to	 4.323056413869379
country neighbourhood i assure you there is quite as much of that	 3.7669079144820232
restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield she	 3.4940150038840727
which do you mean and turning round he looked for a moment at	 3.7788668660110676
own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to	 3.9170300761910366
than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring	 3.6990156525725206
he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it	 3.48889782602063
consider how important every moment is in such a case	 3.5722286038677025
lydia was exceedingly fond of him he was her dear wickham on every	 3.2351625090155482
might strike them that they could be more economically though less	 4.137203978277288
else gave way before the hope of janes being in the fairest way for	 4.442729934694463
well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much	 3.6582238468183235
left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in	 3.8553219872207714
for any thing more lady catherine will not think the worse of you for	 3.6806495798221697
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentlemans	 3.4241221157732924
with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her	 4.702943367530638
pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to	 3.2462259262464426
contrary he was all attention to every body by nature inoffensive	 3.309250104028826
interest in him	 3.450096495534452
your coming to longbourn to see me and my family said elizabeth	 3.7269090879898523
me in every respect	 3.3446483707203427
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence	 3.777172163562482
youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of	 3.7650521614111985
her uncle your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him	 3.5404757377856
at least it shews that she was serious in the object of her journey	 4.119436218737844
reflection and she sat in misery till mr darcy appeared again when	 3.206030903434588
them	 2.8809987006437088
but only because her husbands regiment happens to be so far off if	 4.264792454715077
not pronounce she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his	 4.005347480493242
reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon	 3.851932268285776
fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that	 3.409440149477144
though he was now established only as a tenant miss bingley was by no	 4.6147653866559475
it was evident that he was very much in love with her they saw much to	 3.6864357365393663
1e8 you may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing	 3.621350772159094
assistance would be every thing in the world he will immediately	 3.7356093562291397
them	 2.8809987006437088
they came the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive	 4.532206024157383
when the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to elizabeth	 3.809324125440749
had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have	 3.332438577105476
decorums which other people may observe if she does not object to it	 3.4908239973318467
thing more is determined on yours c	 3.0797991830507474
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her	 3.16928573769686
deserve	 1.962759145445629
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel many of my acquaintance are	 4.491757823791219
but mrs bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the	 3.8708200860371855
entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some	 4.505059259970315
in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to mrs	 5.142707292896439
sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon	 3.8058918639964943
husband any satisfactory description of mr bingley they attacked him	 4.793987320316947
her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally	 3.6422966716741003
with great energybut it is a subject which always makes a lady	 4.800924163173523
my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission	 3.76789630093262
better	 3.760335225152566
gallantry from the idea it suggested of something moreit now first	 3.5031557725986593
i do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of	 3.744170469091784
never been a favourite with them mr and mrs gardiner could not but be	 3.2556527388277376
and all the articles of plate which mr collins had promised and as he	 4.461248731692332
he meant i believe replied jane to go to epsom the place where	 4.359925667019098
never seen the view	 3.6183993093797704
you are too hasty sir she cried you forget that i have made no	 3.2145457341514097
if it is designedly done they cannot be justified but i have no idea	 4.670670358284012
being at home again in a day or two jane was already so much recovered	 3.2262919263088468
absent but had not courage for it at length however the question was	 3.2151719257651123
not and we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was	 4.551498544287488
indeed	 3.887897791466739
staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it	 4.3696328333751335
happiest wisest most reasonable end	 3.327667117464558
it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now	 4.23494123801125
way that would induce you to accept me	 4.245583572686191
first opportunity of saying with sneering civility	 3.60658324528024
elizabeth could not but look surprised	 2.9646284186230965
forster say had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement	 3.518812116885189

and they are really to be married cried elizabeth as soon as they	 3.956692084911722
so obstinate as usual other schemes too came into her head	 3.7033888785016322

that is a question which i hardly know how to answer we all love to	 2.8386219322850477
oh if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in	 3.5543178768037604
impossible mr bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him	 4.02001119219345
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr	 4.3529823686888
comfort was that mr bingley must be down again in the summer	 3.426288536711999
into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on	 4.247125046176527
disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town and	 4.147143573474211
housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all mr bingley	 3.4699183839010947
but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of	 5.164611261395764

oh no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so	 3.136097005428745
be not so let mr darcy contradict it besides there was truth in his	 3.24457234436031
according to his information he has given in all his debts i hope	 4.150349459880399

the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not	 3.4754206652607795
politeness by the whole family mr bennet indeed said little but the	 3.5393376604915603
quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas	 3.331901757072291

her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me if your	 4.905435354900532

and looked and spoke with the same goodhumoured ease that he had ever	 4.348780441976035
and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy	 4.815356846840886
ten thousand pounds heaven forbid how is half such a sum to be	 3.677308582163808
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to	 3.2553800579871948
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however	 5.319707977276962
was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she	 3.415414281531026
continued	 3.950117670475359

the world perhaps other people have said so before but not one	 3.2589961554354763
to the late mr darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the	 3.6065314827304684
prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute	 3.4254041885332405
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner you had much better	 3.6226549179501126
may be offensive to yours i can only say that i am sorrythe	 3.8146635795670956
girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is	 3.5521799329272215
no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her	 3.8970856483452496
did not you think mr darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well	 3.3722414541592887
it is not mr bingley said her husband it is a person whom i	 3.8262715595873438
coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again	 4.358748128863327
elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though	 3.36470076148618
quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr darcy	 3.8821245424333077
hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded for	 4.7240804136810555
london georgianas reception of them was very civil but attended with	 4.709628423170859
my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly	 2.9821187870587127
great pleasure in the power of choice i do not know any body who seems	 3.8162240652906374
regard	 4.118504181787366
figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own	 3.2218659331638686
produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched	 4.4509315235543285
way and after a moments pause added	 3.415706888873363
ramsgate last summer i made a point of her having two men servants go	 3.28082342227926
any silly cause i was only confused for the moment because i felt	 4.19616143248522
immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour but	 3.8690919648561835
and all was soon right again	 3.3572356150189453
and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without	 3.9731284850348443
sure will not hear of her removal	 3.384615831381155
present and prepare for another disappointment her tour to the lakes	 4.252010179976315
to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and	 3.6365873155155124
the most agreeable man i ever sawand if he becomes really attached to	 3.9422995466110753
and of this place thought she i might have been mistress with	 3.8330587821200894
when this information was given and they had all taken their seats mr	 3.494224358613593
so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george	 3.5119420412311384
in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the	 3.670263966118912
longbourn the children two girls of six and eight years old and two	 4.329488826953611
i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were	 3.3008791812729723
kitty did she very innocently said what is the matter mamma what do	 3.83183890685631
the latter with regard to new furniture	 3.217451054693508
beyond a walk with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten	 3.934315330558531
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an	 3.8134812042072452
but of this answer lydia heard not a word she seldom listened to any	 3.2925208186950377
end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by	 3.3920103165231814
he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of	 3.977725816983566
in the room	 2.853877207574405
elizabeths collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and	 3.4263127933361766
work or any other work associated with project gutenbergtm	 3.0144614449610256
and this is your real opinion this is your final resolve very well i	 3.9971213475538336
trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so well	 3.8858099603943517
my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the	 3.990262651734611
them ill	 3.875719246577502
bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of	 3.8548115931348526
own future property the dinner too in its turn was highly admired and	 3.2100519220311727
i am astonished my dear said mrs bennet that you should be so	 3.442491887661512
overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the	 3.920574427195016
in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence elizabeth made no	 3.4104853151061425
messages to his sister mr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet and	 3.586371030714281
find however that colonel f is not disposed to depend upon their	 3.6033730497784173
certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with	 3.1782230398198643
the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice	 5.217347381186986
it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not	 3.4525851560634613
it ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many	 3.2884590347618543
i do not recollect that we did	 3.665043305389918
spirits increased she longed to see mrs philips the lucases and all	 5.3050561787542145
assemblies and that mrs long has promised to introduce him	 3.4637144325689935
merely to the illustration of your character said she endeavouring	 4.644785439885834
hearing the very best performers on miss lucass persevering however	 3.684828475457843
acquaintance an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much	 3.7385733699389827
thing and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two	 4.69646980308347
miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though	 4.852153563253053
collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only	 3.4082255809555413

amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to	 3.5048330689825495
months of having another daughter married to mr collins she thought	 3.682212523810331
coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible	 4.461878248125554
at her sister and bingley shall take place what congratulations will	 3.5199041104213724
in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable both	 4.206017304546978
then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your	 3.4009737665812714
she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will	 4.6095697942766725
he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when	 3.518305440051792

ayebecause she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he	 3.3415430270976385
who have been kept aloof by lydias folly	 3.5276198886933154
to mr and mrs gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage	 3.3408119014959206
not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small	 4.454733332985022
i began to be afraid you would never come back again people did say	 3.468703581546219
you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me	 4.721205959348076
had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful	 3.2255112825609262
it at all advisable after sitting a little while with jane on miss	 3.987297746937062
yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot come	 2.9239254606393565
at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never	 3.9149877108681372
next morning to london	 3.323778433247554
of what might be called economy in her own private expences she	 3.9940058626736548
her nieces beginning the subject	 3.1934521844096735
for being so silly	 3.8964005195368627
her companions when is your turn to come you will hardly bear to be	 3.161066274025667
reflections as must make her unfit for conversation	 4.13485652651992
at length the chaise arrived the trunks were fastened on the parcels	 3.359748466028503
the foundations principal office is located at <NUMBER> melan dr s	 3.1640473587922138

boy	 1.962759145445629
saturday and to saturday he still meant to stay	 3.3783027773767067
they were joined by mr collins who entered with an air more stately	 3.230520653501815
she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out she	 3.5803382089608364
so totally independent of every one	 4.802249304754017
with a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing	 3.8576123582967625
thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on	 3.2393197801299736
of his father	 3.4760603115614925
unless a copyright notice is included thus we do not necessarily	 3.166141955548171

them from mr darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to	 4.566836950917279
he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his	 3.095924903350125
what he really is sometime hence it will be all found out and then we	 4.124221537839882
as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided	 4.006953513051768
seen him so pleasant as this morning	 3.6628658146430233
a day or two since we first cameand yet how many things have	 3.021217594975296

mr bingley and under your orders	 3.2562431874745563
miss bingley i think i have heard you say that you know them	 3.264126757474837
to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any	 3.677891503714519
hopes of mr bingleys heart were entertained	 4.187110504616309

tears in her eyes that a sisters sense of decency and virtue in such	 4.271851157044125
interval of waiting appeared very long it was over at last however the	 3.331521539375489
happiness no no let me shift for myself and perhaps if i have very	 3.805676409343549
i never saw such a woman i never saw such capacity and taste and	 3.277367933953595
will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt	 3.5064698192850807

thing in the world how strange must it appear to him in what a	 3.504452297951693
darcy mentioned his letter did it said he did it soon make you	 3.4767349804392573
set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked	 3.3584493077992343

indignation after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she	 3.236923688543233
should be in some danger	 3.6852302021604597
but that is nothing to us you know sister we agreed long ago never to	 3.056262530458071
all the unhappiness she had brought on her family if she heard me	 4.325636386618225
pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have	 3.6679487908181896
exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i	 3.8354361190628476

with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers it was	 5.252228006331762
my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for	 3.6902816011566792
but allow that mr bingley when questioned by jane had long ago	 4.1387364344845645
dear maam do not goi beg you will not gomr collins must excuse	 4.41919800595031
thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and	 3.449420875130047
miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards got up and walked about	 3.2899860858993777
way that maria thought herself obliged on her return to undo all the	 2.9954670395458565

you that i do not want to dance a reel at alland now despise me if	 4.508782624257265
of what are you telling miss bennet let me hear what it is	 3.414497070707976
last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy	 4.311993808356183
habit of saying made no mention of the business that had taken him	 3.3102961733403

he is gone i never saw such a long chin in my life well but now for	 3.6259589819418117
good heaven can it be really so yet now i must believe you cried	 3.141406430514547
darcys using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he	 3.419478030749527
invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he	 3.6069974319236957
nor can i find there was any intention of being so but if you are	 3.5351616611602807

lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to	 3.5457791489844466
i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly	 3.4152026671323417
much entailed as ever the lucases are very artful people indeed	 3.8832205337678123
she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far	 4.447350796961508

her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without	 3.4059509813863036
could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easiness	 3.092908779802446
had been compromised accordingly	 2.559374302125996
love and the object of that love her friend eliza she sat herself	 3.458454037102575
due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which	 3.339320567642141
civil for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well	 3.902984289918917
with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her	 3.361245569443282
see her either at longbourn or netherfield and embracing her most	 3.909266907826699
i am grieved indeed cried darcy grievedshocked but is it	 3.5791288535262575
great comfort to them in their hours of freedom their other aunt also	 3.5981517940475354
bingley was the person meant it was all conjecture	 3.44517330947769
and completely do for us at once good heaven brighton and a whole	 3.4453150482358823

attentions of the officers to whom her uncles good dinners and her own	 4.394446216923901
mr collins	 3.043008937102763
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away	 4.243648291489415
thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect too	 2.886744444974017
the day passed much as the day before had done mrs hurst and miss	 3.585292339796357
pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more	 4.545694227983454
for she loves to be of use but tell me what did you come down to	 4.000187726290122
when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the	 5.285956748624124
instruct though we can teach only what is not worth knowing forgive	 3.383800598373864
his sister it is really too distressing i am sure you must feel it	 3.364310950106157
which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open	 3.7834207487886347
deserving her mothers reproach prevented his feeling any regret	 3.228982849991821
poor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his	 3.548482568834669
neighbours might all see mr bingley in consequence of it before they	 3.5602025709499583
in the kingdomprovided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the	 3.822826056729951
the room her figure was elegant and she walked wellbut darcy at	 3.710373301377371
only once with mrs hurst and once with miss bingley declined being	 3.918930804061224
you will have janes is nothing to itnothing at all i am so	 3.9912332958540415
jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their	 4.409743434124925

appeared dissatisfied on the strength of darcys regard bingley had the	 4.358628312595647

what do you mean	 2.5945463945045923

it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to	 4.143803583373818

miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to	 3.5244793250675377

night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she	 3.740095143962858
of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express	 3.432834374253024
contents i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink	 3.3876545452696623

why should we	 3.3488486821794696
mr gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from	 3.2349635227685423
her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of	 4.495905236122713
catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but lydia with perfect	 4.3780734440926725
well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what	 3.3644064452025324
mrs gardiner then rallied her niece on wickhams desertion and	 3.4337097134713703
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any	 3.334565513913037
so much the better it cannot be done too much and when i next write	 3.1146058926613303
incomprehensible but now it was all too natural for such an attachment	 3.4877603197887757
inferior to what elizabeth felt	 3.3702587225280736
i certainly shall not you know how i detest it unless i am	 3.6588641777295887
distraction of his thoughts	 3.4603486769150713

liable to you for actual direct indirect consequential punitive or	 3.729340646534412

with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance	 4.4214890985943285

mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley he	 4.294080831223143
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts she was not sorry however to	 3.823789889258375
opinion it is really too great a violation of decency honour and	 4.053137738382598

he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle	 5.212549592524206
every hour in his esteem	 3.6650035572823727
elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for	 3.5833326866106137
an hour after every body else was gone which gave them time to see how	 3.3857671377451357
eminence where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by	 4.4150120989559545
there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted	 4.043248967853211
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish self reproach she could find	 5.476635416996749
there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliams manners	 4.451445566302181
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste they were	 4.138951315650486
to accompany sir william and his second daughter the improvement of	 3.412099934401977
feelings	 3.864688524052059
the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to	 4.087114388378267
gone	 4.145668618885672
without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now	 4.350970254639576
thought of him and mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by	 4.634987515083948
little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss	 3.6942063720838276

house lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr	 3.6030349845795566
elizabeth after the health of her family she answered him in the usual	 3.2718911019755685
could flatter herself with such an expectation surprise was the least	 3.5461323975950134
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at	 3.2451471215663266
folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering	 3.545011082631735
in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently	 4.015525428209843
will join me early tomorrow he continued and among them are some	 3.049011679725796
comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied	 3.6652393263971397
consequence as this should ensue you may easily believe was far	 3.743727264753631
to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is	 3.1893942162731292
necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence	 4.064004237974484
likes very much the officers may not be so pleasant in general s	 3.8141763187100204
yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both	 4.978474474105916
scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every	 3.584949316499966
to become of us all the collinses will turn us out before he is cold	 3.6798296044041434

it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty	 3.944522702513932

another reason too for her opposition she dreaded seeing wickham again	 4.343845797319648
disagreeable man all to yourself but i hope you will not mind it it is	 3.1460926469531447

and you can copy and distribute it in the united states without	 3.753691717083608

about pretty much for my part i am inclined to believe it all mr	 3.8213172150679906

with any certainty we had better not mention it i am extremely	 3.7418631987486766

i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they	 3.208976957458538
the caprice of their inclinations had his own happiness however been	 3.564888635805607
and he soon afterwards said aloud mr bennet have you no more lanes	 3.7220895164688157
do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an	 3.2415505144654966
as soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was	 4.435536785725494
without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising	 3.3272233177552972
greatest share the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had	 4.645917105368492
indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored	 3.307780385197664
darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth	 3.2031355131023136
even elizabeth began to fearnot that bingley was indifferentbut that	 4.569571418675977
she herself had been barbarously used by them all and on these two	 4.289386370299906
and was finally settled according to charlottes first sketch she was	 3.498825088958084
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them	 4.143054508805915
resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity	 3.530228999778056
the place immediately and mrs younge was of course removed from	 3.7914045032883243
either now seriously what have you ever known of selfdenial and	 3.3604025055653284
between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr philipss	 3.6974421017379875

me would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it	 4.207503550482709
when he looked at her she stood several minutes before the picture in	 3.40427880482186
confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running up	 3.632383983875281
mrs gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found	 4.031378567359337
purpose to inquire after her mr darcy corroborated it with a bow and	 4.763899794244869

when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very	 3.330629289816913
goodnatured when children are goodnatured when they grow up and he	 3.9548815171081158
over he naturally returned to all his former indolence his letter was	 3.828143454554671
obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility	 3.584605632139574
respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of	 3.2987661276696514
pride and prejudice	 2.5036346075861795
and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry did he know of	 3.1145769515697896
shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information	 3.689114957766776
that he was so well convinced of lady catherines discernment as to be	 3.626046443670259
aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if	 4.5592813846042395
would come in the evening this was agreed to and mrs philips	 3.6577294551044326
elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol	 3.7518684689698567
actually with them if such goodness does not make her miserable now	 3.677766405508411

myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both	 3.663433104858009
elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such	 4.008871358927139
who i believe will soon become a part of the family	 3.6451243236823765

altogether mr bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and	 3.2406334378570962
occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to	 4.730725342750723
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down	 2.932787067647824
in return by sitting down to whist	 3.5536071945609975
think no more about him	 3.4777545599391573
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful	 3.6942731205222463
at five oclock the two ladies retired to dress and at half past six	 5.001955739157967
read and had all the masters that were necessary those who chose to be	 3.728675952578563

beautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collected	 5.576978091343403
attention in the whole course of his life	 3.521481148121515
strikingly alteredwhat could it mean that he should even speak to	 3.720260991336181
how despicably have i acted she criedi who have prided myself on	 3.7642102978909415
elizabeth made no objectionthe door was then allowed to be shut and	 3.2310053558492764
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and	 4.934873898745477
one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him i could not	 4.624437794716591
could not exist in the world two men over whom mr darcy could have	 3.9469755886682787

whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would	 4.1225610446479815
she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely	 3.6387655748522296

cannot escape the acquaintance now	 3.8807414637239375
we have dined nine times at rosings besides drinking tea there	 3.358598864960834

strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so	 4.311351356727934
the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out	 3.6756787477771526
she is grown so brown and coarse louisa and i were agreeing that we	 5.150697577631743
with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all the	 3.1323116993483064
lucases i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says	 3.5166767226651405

another young man	 3.509752560096092
knowing what she did she accepted him he walked away again	 3.7106951342106953
what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the	 3.6180102203934994
of matrimony in his parish secondly that i am convinced it will add	 4.3671962895002805
must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was	 3.462969960563465
all miss bingleys witticisms on fine eyes	 3.451964458987236
he turned to his partner and said	 3.554336462780577
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise i	 3.2583411213019136
to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the	 4.282558090368335
welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to	 3.421684562281276
most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he	 3.640788839478023

to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachmans	 3.6979327901305954
ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand	 3.788438252755886

catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman for	 3.2226330233820826
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady	 3.0342305550897004
despising his fellowcreatures in general but did not suspect him of	 4.063630008705521
seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent	 3.382605113897693
kind of supposition which had appeased mrs bennets curiosity and	 3.6968083780640897

hour her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was	 3.9936117556405613
successfully combated by the more natural influence of janes	 3.4739102524674306
lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer	 2.825542810898383
something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of	 3.4862417337872107
it was not till the afternoon when he joined them at tea that	 3.320546641210781

charlottes prudent steady character remember that she is one of a	 3.7200886123648855
could be more natural than his asking you again he could not help	 3.466630572951605
could divide them he was on one side of her mother she knew how little	 3.8734187481625435
her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on	 3.669412883217042
and in their brothers manners there was something better than	 3.2698853970175232

as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great	 3.287873944146241

you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after	 3.3551070487174464

1e9	 1.962759145445629
was my confidence was as natural as your suspicion i do not at	 4.392484951836178
to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to	 3.8793813213848276
himself at her feet he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins	 3.9270074490285944
me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance	 4.200233960292338
let me call your maid is there nothing you could take to give you	 3.396942352956277
which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit when mr collins could be	 3.206349992716585
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was	 3.08740515737654
she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh and trusting their	 3.361230649872373
feared w was not a man to be trusted my poor mother is really ill	 4.252113385359943
why did not you all learnyou ought all to have learned the miss	 4.202912500859127
every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give	 3.874197375680454
very little of his time there in future he has many friends and he is	 3.373751678339677
subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for	 4.068927001516612
case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it	 3.498189625173351
attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i	 4.4964088006327625
interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those	 4.199959415137547
noi feel he may defy us there and as to laughter we will not expose	 4.157911178616686
keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an	 4.143433661952688
were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with	 3.658347870422915
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy himself but	 3.853355022742131
and distributed to anyone in the united states without paying any fees	 3.921584167211707
chapter viii	 1.9070367688535859
and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage	 3.822451381249264
a favourable answer he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but his	 3.3460826487869544
eight the express was sent off directly my dear lizzy they must	 3.0937595237452427
what does mr darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my	 4.0004147879359175
and ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberately	 4.900736469153334
in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your	 4.056864462624098
shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight	 3.8158141264262513
jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own	 3.1713846292671484
doubted and was silent this he considered sufficient encouragement	 3.295648699263372
high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chuses to be seen	 5.052635714215095
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched	 4.887421438318586
dependence when have you been prevented by want of money from going	 3.1719115491549834
had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as	 3.1323882482337155
sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our	 3.9678032269502865
interest in the eyes of his friend mr darcy had at first scarcely	 3.793702559778338
or rather he has not wickhams countenance for his features are	 3.9262234012736803
being acceptable	 3.0402603581100998
appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight their eyes	 3.4929484092058343
miss bennet paused a little and then replied surely there can be no	 3.754088086373213
apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without being	 4.548330470006539
was repeated to colonel f who instantly taking the alarm set off	 3.1484769120443055
i hope you are well miss bennet that lady i suppose is your mother	 3.6886753915986654
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help	 4.115179217107003
well cried elizabeth have it as you choose he shall be	 3.5577327632347004
that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me	 4.220657457961728
overlooked it was gratitudegratitude not merely for having once	 3.4849175554720215
library to myself as soon as may be	 4.157764400101594
against your will against your reason and even against your character	 3.228864655926424
disengaged he never came near enough to speak she felt it to be the	 3.735013058348171
take us all there for the summer it would be such a delicious scheme	 4.573848020049572
am strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friends	 3.691677540321939
despicable	 1.962759145445629
advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr	 3.1351153975865347
has often said so and envied me janes beauty i do not like to boast	 4.0693623446783
it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be	 3.0832738821782364
in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with her	 3.074342694285755
resentfully since we are not to visit	 4.13573442666119
approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the	 4.099825415117713
again over the perverseness of the meeting and his behaviour so	 4.394719037140309
watchfulness has been effectual and though i should certainly be a more	 3.9736095926576196
wickham she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and	 3.3695131331011416
of your sisters countenance and air was such as might have given	 3.6377161499863546
when the gentlemen rose to go away mrs bennet was mindful of her	 4.0025567080256055
with regard to lady catherines family is indeed the sort of	 3.2899214030139023
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here	 4.771541920012
civilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a	 3.5667486088714746
less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now	 3.401090220348252
conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from	 3.5481515337224145
i have heard from authority which i thought as good that it was	 3.5968261474739354
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings partyi assure	 4.229362450018663
and the kind of halfexpectation which mrs gardiner had formed of	 3.86708620941406
enough happened in the time good gracious when i went away i am sure	 3.5267624114869665
accomplished for her age her performance on the pianoforte is	 4.108038802273407
did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him	 3.3839262861592108
her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with	 4.778859080443596
library	 4.264621521790546
it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this	 3.2841045246041234
but does lydia know nothing of this can she be ignorant of what you	 3.310847831093511
good gracious cried mrs bennet as she stood at a window the next	 3.8671544577212047
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence	 3.5768564835752117
when he first came into the room in no countenance was attentive	 3.1694523689435052
you shall hear what she says	 3.3224962343986997
repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and	 4.351836393270939
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter	 3.29317306646561
affected when to her utter amazement she saw mr darcy walk into the	 4.599860743044054
indirect boast	 2.1555682567671157
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it	 3.762929221572304
mr darcy with a very expressive smile elizabeth for the sake of	 3.628962694998699
bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter	 3.7776473610013235
mr bennet treated the matter differently so lizzy said he one day	 3.468444742707821
complained bitterly of all this to her husband	 4.1240324892701805
so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her	 4.6305928340702245
disposition lizzy i know that you could be neither happy nor	 3.590322134433407
jane who was the general favourite and whose steady sense and	 2.9979348736386564
forth in this agreement you must obtain permission in writing from	 3.2410408289786803
i must find mr gardiner this moment on business that cannot be	 3.054338742116471
manner observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he	 4.647602165785903
intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a	 3.270638867098504
of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man	 3.407630127004823
returning to netherfield again	 2.92590493150865
lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr darcy drawing near	 4.13226504066118
the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some	 3.8110826642850615
which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming	 3.828420627853294
she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion	 3.6156119871761105
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed	 3.599739262530989
elizabeths astonishment was beyond expression she stared coloured	 3.6051112364413993
the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would	 3.615452788039026
serviceand perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as	 3.40410235137564
of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition	 3.494094284973101
manner made him start and before he could recover himself enough to	 4.14711074911476
admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion	 5.041984551866826
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickhamthe	 3.0683596879249215
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room she wished she	 3.677760230848139
winter	 4.230479570974989
you may as well call it impertinence at once it was very little less	 3.6834934795094383
added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to	 3.4477002901878038
and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently there has	 4.166825835868275
affection you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong and me most	 4.120670104425381
the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants	 3.5055080398958083
preserved	 1.962759145445629
in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of	 3.459180781629371
the applicable state law the invalidity or unenforceability of any	 5.1622485546716534
lydia was a stout wellgrown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion	 5.377998000692209
the north of england a circumstance more deeply impressed on their	 4.517509546147426
struck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of	 4.1043789322990945
i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley how can mr bingley	 3.670305514373468
i cannot do justice to his kindness he meant to provide for me amply	 4.0555294822687555
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the	 3.7633005084584665
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very	 3.949455682012969
elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and	 4.530006312061123
but did not live to do itmr bingley intended it likewise and	 3.3064653950192144
manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it	 5.262853383455428
bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him	 4.11472634243668
discover them but he had something to direct his search which was	 4.721080418517878
alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed	 4.770014643893843
and down the room in earnest meditation his brow contracted his air	 4.701835489612233
of the officers wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing	 3.7177221352447414
forgiveness the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlottes	 3.6235465749890903
before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered	 3.904718416874935
ladies i have more than once observed to lady catherine that her	 3.978938808734675
la replied kitty it looks just like that man that used to be with	 2.990130478745598
clothes must reflect on her daughters nuptials than to any sense of	 4.218956648955216
comes here tomorrow with him	 3.457373961056339
regiment to accompany her to brighton this invaluable friend was a	 4.54756798910877
each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the	 4.301688653133012
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance mrs hurst and	 3.325788487072353
unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in and i hope my dinners	 3.587039785839866
other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be	 3.956078189624578
forbearance and though mrs philips as well as her sister stood in	 3.9050667804362296
door and met maria in the landing place who breathless with	 4.2827150683489545
compliment must be all for herself her astonishment however was	 3.3503313927845815
all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of	 3.0737235182432845
good news from town so i took the liberty of coming to ask	 4.40833038208074
was rather too early to begin in anticipating the happiness of bingley	 4.5631785031544725
marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere she wrote even	 4.121647852799824
i was surprised to see darcy in town last month we passed each other	 3.135693215341331
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than	 3.9673270864299615
you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to	 3.255552465252068
humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at	 3.9913228210770084
whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his	 3.7984564466136876
felt a wish of enquiring his countenance voice and manner had	 3.8053233449823654
confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due	 3.9501584472094313
it that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable	 4.672068938757162
prejudice against every thing he might say she began his account of	 3.236979944601142
nothing particular to say to you lizzy	 4.0819655693999115
with an air of distant civility mr collins however was not	 2.848914357522123
third time i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just	 3.88687688201229
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant	 4.529603160919683
doubted not as the most generous of his sex but while he was mortal	 4.345063015553812
till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley	 3.894028971877641
she looked and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with	 3.304133262674093
vanity in useless or blameable distrusthow humiliating is this	 5.270425686283024
heard the good news miss lydia is going to be married and you shall	 3.6753527571644686

electronic work or any part of this electronic work without	 3.192092221265396
good heaven what is to become of us what are we to do would they	 3.37853926913663
not yet replied jane but now that my dear uncle is come i hope	 3.3801934788184615
that is a question which mr darcy only can answer	 3.016769174604642
upon elizabeths seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about	 4.416280937694975
to escape she added lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing	 4.4542859984849645

arrangement of them if his own vanity however did not mislead him	 3.5241915396057344
was not conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to	 3.640384294262159
the time she had the same story to repeat every day mrs bennets best	 4.73190423833546
he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight for lady catherine	 3.5961733075067306

in this interference from what she had said of her resolution to	 3.746187712627941
being so thin and so small there was neither in figure nor face any	 3.6383258553223707

you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings	 3.726005202962227
on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at	 3.820480739844071
know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in	 3.8697006708787502
resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer i pity though i	 4.024522102581949
meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future	 5.130610499832032
but why all this secrecy why any fear of detection why must their	 3.2852715221011355
when they approached her she said to miss bennet i beg your pardon	 4.166600369743351
from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and	 4.0900721335414705
never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter	 3.7740309937196503
when the card tables were placed he had an opportunity of obliging her	 4.804547373107209
represented	 1.962759145445629
between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those	 5.2255378557236245

such an evil	 3.752149386306295
spirits oppressively high no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her	 4.60588495553704
complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so far	 3.9427938948687604
such a matter	 3.576517789669252
they should not object to know more of miss bennet was therefore	 3.5957294514757403
poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the	 4.342995679505807
connections and pride	 3.7674752034806716
printed for t egerton	 2.4389690338814876

adieu is charity itself but think no more of the letter the feelings	 4.36084543419399

much he will give her stay stay i will go myself ring the bell	 3.6430851249955074
perhaps it would have been better replied her sister but to expose	 3.658727394409536
miraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of money and rank she	 3.8899601384967255
them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference	 3.6130530010730824
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own but	 3.8428064640725488

occasion no one was to be put in competition with him he did every	 4.748016833514552
affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in	 3.3393885800771925
its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during	 3.792498251889312
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had	 4.7443551752091935
and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room	 4.781224317200022
and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly	 4.291612850335851
consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her	 3.219039721932043
she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full	 4.595697018340981

took him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as we	 3.8542730418373576

such a flutter that i am sure i cant write so i will dictate and you	 4.376206808654619
elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief and the other that	 3.9870076249115263
is this thought elizabeth meant for me and she coloured at the	 3.7037572558562877
breeding but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to	 3.5776316907494397
country because her sister had a cold her hair so untidy so blowsy	 4.037376902376292
mr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred	 4.499940569376464

discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he	 3.4550135491263396
now i have got some news for you said lydia as they sat down to	 2.904170609233824
about its relative situation let our first effusions be less	 3.1914918449438243

courted you therei have saved you the trouble of accounting for it	 4.41635327765875
rosings rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must wait	 5.047009306976362
her soon sunk into indifference hers lasted a little longer and in	 3.8896699534250754
myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley	 3.618826540357156
elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet	 4.181382434613169
of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at	 3.3511100840456476

he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were and that	 3.3871166806334623
but is there not danger of lady catherines disapprobation here my	 3.338813035045622
unless he really comes to see her	 3.4895937587881654
only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can	 4.269258176531377

as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits	 3.4797586890014967
elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself	 3.8341445585603364
when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in	 3.350856167010746

elizabeth you are not serious now	 3.838435198711896
particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening	 3.9418859320789217
mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was	 3.1893994078623256
owe you you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most	 3.866921898062332
as to be in gracechurchstreet by noon as they drove to mr gardiners	 4.60952914986658
into the drawingroom	 3.5135838085248903
certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that	 4.023692628557145
not to hear in a doleful voice mrs bennet thus began the projected	 3.5432420807735037
concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had	 3.392483874953628
bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes	 4.33015519298333
charlottes observation and hurried her away to her room	 4.4630975536550475
her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and	 3.730841561999925
with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held	 3.890386989936007
they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had	 4.445894212205653
she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement	 3.6060535753435894
her a very good sort of girl there can be no love in all this my	 3.619895547758579
to say the truth i was too cross to write you supposed more than	 3.657806638263142
delayed a little longer and mr collinss proposal accepted with as	 3.3213505946004664
visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of	 2.9698431240631202
agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly	 4.767926190755279
she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some ones	 4.118390957725235
spirits and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had	 3.9071018401960895
shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill and if i was	 3.490659825152548
aunt and all mr collinss scruples of leaving mr and mrs bennet for	 3.9540817935066
selfattracted by the rest of her familyand as she considered that	 5.286756797508686
a misfortune to be liked by him mrs long told me last night that he	 3.4642138252152446
match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too	 6.407050225958316
she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said	 3.9093583206442184
minutes at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here	 3.1859091958954573
backgammon mr bennet accepted the challenge observing that he acted	 3.4095593006489304
himself obliged to accept	 3.5143565157071492
commendation to think of her as he chose	 3.776646665266999
elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily	 3.5468555967129505
yes to the last but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what	 4.047954436052394
and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and	 3.43827260530642
wholly unexpected i had not an idea of it	 4.37267782139092
elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend he	 4.142495693531505
take whatever you like and get away	 3.2811631879020853
reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time	 3.6221022493193322
our own vanity that deceives us women fancy admiration means more than	 3.1075073201756074
their mother mr collinss letter had done away much of her illwill	 3.4683775419084943
therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to	 3.703079844484683
he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to any	 3.215151444033061
continue at least a twelvemonth	 3.220148573356492
understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference	 3.9030668056286615
and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the	 3.2069717933966273
back a supply of clothes	 5.2087192581408015
professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable	 4.005804599426989
comprehends every virtue	 3.3904132908875617
his uncle lord and to the great surprise of all the party when	 4.0103813878273
conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim	 4.241396997274146
gutenbergtm trademark and any other party distributing a project	 3.5480041368950084
you are over scrupulous surely i dare say mr bingley will be very	 3.6547267788857654
took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest	 3.9803546284156646
of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far	 3.950245585971891
hall the diningroom and all its furniture were examined and praised	 4.936511875971211
little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she	 4.554435424593475
the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she	 4.47945594780216
laugh at them whenever i canbut these i suppose are precisely what	 3.246734705812891
thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his	 4.736142114634237
i see no occasion for that you and the girls may go or you may send	 3.420943437599071
as well as greater certainty absence had increased her desire of seeing	 3.596298771755691
this accounted to elizabeth for mr wickhams being among them	 3.71494009256136
when tea was over mr hurst reminded his sisterinlaw of the	 3.8342199431223225
them both the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were	 3.503452515639902
you	 3.18677515817083
possessed of bringing on the renewal of his addresses	 3.557189943517975
truth oh that i knew how it was	 3.512857056177871
sisters i should not care how proud i was i would keep a pack of	 3.450526880739535
particular allowing for the common demands of the game mr wickham was	 5.23214964773516
been unable to give him a gentlemans education my father was not	 4.50067207669058
satisfy after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel	 3.6028589795180346
handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks	 3.9546086743316975
may never do more than like her if she does not help him on	 3.5097605827897076
objections and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his	 3.2613576477547874
to pemberley therefore they were to go	 3.617136512419693
enquiries which she very early received from mr bingley by a housemaid	 3.534988586061205
pleasure	 3.290132440065112
affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing	 4.534094236658906
what can be the meaning of this said charlotte as soon as he was	 3.076364569691676
which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without	 3.688791584651517
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be	 6.113950998081027
should have been a great proficient and so would anne if her health	 4.492478352604947

vol iii	 2.1555682567671157
arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of	 3.846287338128793
of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness	 3.29412941964714

in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an	 3.1464567065522546
bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydias	 3.5420098957638255
was due to seniority and for the first evening she was his settled	 4.589824926920293
this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently	 3.946338141488328
father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their	 3.3659691361066293
oh my dear continued mrs bennet i am quite delighted with him he	 3.2644457551501613
she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of	 3.527286726919599
actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her he never	 3.5274954296583467
recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of	 4.628320129778301
i am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me so before if i	 3.2428119028656752
this web site includes information about project gutenbergtm	 4.196748674898559
next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and	 3.6249247656499417
sake of discovering them	 3.4500516193933173
has very much at heart	 3.707177969362292
that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more	 4.2843338708631125
no indeed i did noti knew nothing at all of lady catherines	 3.5441926369132597
me to unfold to any human being having said thus much i feel no	 3.7639615442850194
niece should be married from this house of which i hope you will	 3.5442506834075505
nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter	 4.3291776857324455
i ought what i dared to do but i knew noti was afraid of doing too	 3.711100859351691
discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that	 3.9365693353677558
friendly and obliging it was mr collinss picture of hunsford and	 3.604669848672657
cheering and heartening them up though as she never came without	 3.3485627155417395
in general are not more like her does she live near you sir	 3.156097985766429
unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils	 3.3994066958669578
much handsomer than mr bingley and he was looked at with great	 4.173516830713232
to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must soon	 3.4024730145709436
opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me that she could	 4.0128854327388
them so faithfully what will wickham say it was to be such a secret	 3.941444882925473
hand to both	 3.765992118421294
such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to	 3.1833387461590363
suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables	 3.320532003626576
repeating it elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her	 3.5928920817770997
these are home questionsand perhaps i cannot say that i have	 3.285845673275528
letter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediately	 3.489732852415972
given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a good	 4.320299483172114
than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs when they	 3.3382974847932765
eliza bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on her is	 4.292752810880243
guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the	 3.444679274152778
congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever	 4.642579089323489
while she staid with us if i had not perceived by janes letter	 3.9850704723130024
william is mr bingleyis not he so much the man of fashion so	 4.191541438623645
extreme she did not fear her fathers opposition but he was going to	 3.7912026161293046
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give	 3.8731474126718175
and younger children would by that means be provided for five daughters	 3.498393136263171
opinion of hertheir opinion of every bodywould always coincide	 3.7570224793632194
before it beginsbut as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and	 3.846042869860995
her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind	 3.3857182914656985
in a shop window could recal them	 4.137206757678374
expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence	 3.719308466929331
representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and	 4.019906587073251
peculiarities has abilities which mr darcy himself need not disdain	 3.6938295759459887
called on us in this familiar way	 3.6983441939501582
consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every	 4.135045518822139
civility i am thus rejected but it is of small importance	 3.944066712729926

1e unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg	 2.807740577096996
at the parsonage more than once during the time but mr darcy they had	 3.303112497150402
happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a	 4.3294138463362115
argument and want to silence this	 2.911126171197089
palatable to you as it seems to be at present that you actually	 3.7935712556249146
how long has she been such a favouriteand pray when am i to wish you	 4.028791440423482
entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced her	 3.576113278213106

was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to	 4.061431263600056
before you came back jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare	 3.422819575762596
that mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival but	 5.053293980326668
than when they last met were plainly expressed she was disappointed	 3.388065176638424

find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact	 4.005841260925705
what do you mean hill we have heard nothing from town	 3.227686211111978
intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea	 5.359110681245962
i am talking of possibilities charles	 3.359506414296492
agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be	 4.045737940367805
fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind	 3.965731556013922
to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had	 3.6775199661670097
to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea	 3.2630211364735984
saying	 3.980965344743217
him to act as he has done but if you are really innocent and	 4.379303875797027
to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this	 3.867064918241295
work of the morning and pack her trunk afresh	 4.202042521653975
longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved	 3.818994244813276
opened by a servant and mr darcy appeared her pale face and impetuous	 3.6748070642098383
her with his best respects to all her family not forgetting his thanks	 4.182590803548062
might not unreasonably have alarmed her she had dressed with more than	 5.12947050081104
concerned till this moment i never knew myself	 3.662602458658595
and do you impute it to either of those	 3.883761028322297
i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth but it ought to	 3.2475148649973153
he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man	 4.011767905410507
i am not going to run away papa said kitty fretfully if i	 3.8155749976605033
true are the others coming out	 3.4150381192604438
younger boys were to be left under the particular care of their cousin	 3.582859177802392
your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit	 3.421902720461687
pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased	 3.884908383009629
for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect	 3.996947926541673
entering the marriage state	 3.253593774526406
mile behind	 3.3778061099623624
early attention it is from my cousin mr collins who when i am dead	 4.094779322438342
we attempt to describe any particular scene will we begin quarrelling	 3.833272305529885
took place with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new	 3.25750192523467
officers names and connections their lodgings were not long a secret	 3.4820495033748204
complied with i am only ashamed of his asking so little	 3.4060770182006577
below with a book mr hurst looked at her with astonishment	 3.262419334752015
to be learntfor her letters to kitty though rather longer were much	 3.2503488922219805
such splendid expectations he had rather hoped that all his wifes	 4.130733673879642
little matters	 2.74961405603543
mrs bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of	 3.4996175904469937
prey	 1.962759145445629
point as well as the still more interesting one of bingleys being	 3.771697573669536
yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and	 4.448029124173173
now kitty you may cough as much as you chuse said mr bennet and	 3.5515848569493067

exceed their income my dear mr bennet cried his wife what are you	 3.910818061391679
it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had	 4.120436597996912
seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year his	 3.292924715021007
if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it	 3.4814945335401792
this information however startled mrs bennetshe would have been	 3.7121080801538278
was spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr collins joining	 3.9328590775462158

perfect as plan could be	 3.8866990746809003
rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from	 4.007082761522056
spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his	 4.2257742799423275
greatly in his favour he had all the best part of beauty a fine	 3.749902299184123
mr gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their	 3.324708064495582
housekeeping i dare say	 3.307719848052861
bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed	 3.3049659996943053
suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter	 3.560611875431056
mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour	 4.580096458284417
for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so	 4.50730276254847
unappeasable you are very cautious i suppose as to its being	 3.6527778457406828

and as they drew near the appointed inn where mr bennets carriage was	 4.142761098835862

sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how	 3.4388657231425994
that i have never been much in love for had i really experienced that	 3.9319112738040642
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr gardiner after	 3.615215081927143

the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits	 4.000904557933645
their premeditated contempt i have therefore made up my mind to tell	 3.014181102799237
with such forbearance and liberality towards him and there are other	 4.3649128014206875

expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere	 4.1508645342686
i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a design of	 3.3326508943452704

an article of news which then began to be in circulation the	 4.192020196529502

interesting object to all my acquaintance were i distractedly in love	 4.21474418385242

freely sharing project gutenbergtm works in compliance with the terms of	 4.9197339552085175
it was a subject which they could not mention before me	 3.3745502392081277

the park was very large and contained great variety of ground they	 3.8750950466408773

indeed you are mistaken i have no such injuries to resent it is not	 4.303817699934869

oh dear yesbut you must own she is very plain lady lucas herself	 4.018683419423093
dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me	 3.462420358412077

that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to	 3.454845600283491
but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had	 3.914072935833232
be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt	 3.5318970907357548
ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his	 3.508887919994839
as handsome as any of them mr bingley might like you the best of the	 3.6249712099589
darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his	 4.359684084802774

believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from	 3.6544456538061185

compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been	 3.696843174180473
willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on	 4.331712671904266
to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickham	 4.140907135560542
miss bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone you ought to	 3.1762803140253673
words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings and he was	 4.588406787477755

together as to what is to be done	 3.828196225170188
of every bodys character and make it still better and say nothing of	 3.614770114984703
catherine would not come in again and rest herself	 3.4395686936922925
accept the honour of their invitation c mrs bennet was quite	 4.232014407087303
to be mistress of pemberley might be something	 3.9772450392406333

and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity mr collinss present	 5.42823544798031
but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him	 3.4829303379228476
how so how can it affect them	 3.6334925031582666

that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely	 3.6429234573976563

large party for the ball and a report soon followed that mr bingley	 3.35834527974896
in speaking of wickham to mr darcy for now they do appear wholly	 3.6437570102582644
to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there	 4.250827338978924
himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to	 3.7773462269334876
and be careful to write explicitly we have judged it best that my	 4.628706967137234
she had heard and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it	 3.866433268545283
it must be my uncles doings generous good man i am afraid he has	 4.63859007765867
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former	 4.592266588845895
well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not	 4.352953553126819
have thought of my meeting withperhapsa nephew of lady catherine de	 3.2617179482847605
i never saw any one so shocked he could not speak a word for full ten	 3.127313358784581

let the other young ladies have time to exhibit	 3.765598942622113
you as ever	 3.934219892873107
ourselves intentionally injured we must not expect a lively young man	 3.575457301329892
family	 3.1722163779891703
visited them all and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity	 4.269066577953882
of receipt of the work	 5.5983409572316
first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds	 3.073617812584754
but it is fortunate thought she that i have something to wish for	 3.5892893642848973
she only said in reply with a goodhumoured smile	 4.123665895558953
father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have	 3.8673824973882054

mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and	 3.4533106307900687
i hope my dear said mr bennet to his wife as they were at	 3.8616190142720423
my part except the shops and public places the country is a vast deal	 5.023762998530554
though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could	 4.442605549019417
hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of	 4.1038752679966235
good conduct i am sure you must not disappoint your father	 3.9601270686867496
could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as much delight	 2.980308507082759
she answered him with cold civility he sat down for a few moments and	 3.4780422570118974
yes but intricate characters are the most amusing they have at	 4.257053214842997
entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh	 3.475939991831306
flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me	 3.2458934929101764
nothing child nothing i did not wink at you she then sat still five	 3.798912392142939
comfortably enough there were half hours of pleasant conversation with	 3.3800263906078585
it is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patience	 3.2554746754745048
custom and mary went up stairs to her instrument two obstacles of the	 3.2665763891184127

for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as	 4.618929286079903
this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter said	 3.0380983362316583

his sister	 3.318565941367948
mrs bennet who quarrelled with no compliments answered most readily	 3.452966815609835
sisters absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of	 4.061269720988462
revived	 1.962759145445629
conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will	 3.3930310168951348
wonder why all this was not told you last night but i was not then	 3.7313883113016106
indeed i could not i was uncomfortable enough i was very	 4.600040921611195

i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the	 4.043685279032195
happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never	 3.8074812936169002
head and sat down without saying a word elizabeth had mentioned her	 3.3042295005760236
consolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress it	 4.6563192468562224
acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen	 3.4865214272199214
elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any	 3.103817411179241
this was not very consoling to mrs bennet and therefore instead of	 4.176333610962346
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from	 4.325241041197693
the title of seduction had been extended into every tradesmans family	 4.116341331718281
him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty you have	 5.400347503957496
satisfaction she had promised herself it was consequently necessary to	 3.683684400804308
so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right	 4.135544167355177
gave way only to the greater distress of mr bingleys continued	 3.8599996130256677
unassuming and gentle elizabeth who had expected to find in her as	 3.684402408272628
visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he	 3.807265263709247
her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of	 4.770764259627117
the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from	 4.481389688471655
partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly	 3.2054701141750566
went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and	 3.6829325483519963
1813	 1.962759145445629
lizzy said he what are you doing are you out of your senses to be	 3.6052644782754686
for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her	 4.273343130140387

honourable lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh	 3.4700697441463
of her feelings on this developement while the contents of the first	 3.8436344279287553

be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most	 4.376959597636784
of an hours têteàtête with mrs bennet before breakfast a	 3.4256643759836707
was returned in due form miss bennets pleasing manners grew on the	 3.1740780321067468
languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the	 3.8003896700096864
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude i was not in a humour to	 4.034773120554218
in love as much as she chuses	 4.214865658045286
warranties of merchantability or fitness for any purpose	 3.8178584273580825
he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to	 3.504202433287452
flirting i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband	 4.1509879390427225
respect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of	 4.07756542154653
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless mr darcy	 3.48287008565329
nothing that she could say however had any influence her mother	 3.748181889701524
such an enormity at so early an age howsoever that may be you	 3.496952844530357
she admired him	 3.690394281476913
say voluntarily to elizabeth	 3.75514905770933
looking rooms walked on	 3.310475762044856
that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask a ladys	 3.1256994390938124
lydias voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open and	 4.367312496256635
not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character	 4.084184729306011
glad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming	 3.439583876575353
of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this	 4.459010031443135
insufferable let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied	 3.511813647579461
fitzwilliams words and these strong objections probably were her	 3.104937363142897
you may be sure of my pardon	 3.387215237766785

she had condemned and upbraided him her anger was turned against	 3.7617888836794884
her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends	 4.487519283687744
mention a word about it and so is it quite certain he is coming	 3.6417499240068034
i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of	 3.6197375516336296
goodnatured wishes for her welldoing which had proceeded before from	 4.252327881295905
confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary	 3.903165786005858
astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the	 4.5425121243911475

the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and	 3.027940262145446
attention his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling	 3.534585740870861
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would	 3.905639803534455

mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her	 3.9128860505210907

preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was	 3.868938663328217
donedone while mrs bennet was stirring the fire elizabeth equally	 5.085676161267031
that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine	 3.1957875757474667
wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern	 3.867271466702793
inferences however were plainly deduced from the whole one that	 4.497965100088104
i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my	 3.2769933171810997
impulses even than pride	 3.392173957335299
which would admit of a chair and on the gentlemens approaching one of	 5.502187732956284
petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him and all the	 4.135831077609203
that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily	 3.755417370215856
repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister	 3.624102825724332
well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to	 3.5497811415783285
her being hereafter our sister i do not know whether i ever before	 3.594499759467797

what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the	 3.6475210800478406
mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother to mr bennets	 3.122422980551957
your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in	 3.253869107752782
family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her	 3.5636449065535016
the utmost to speak with composure when she said	 3.7357586523016075
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body sometimes one	 4.72963887702435
respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked	 4.095506707873849
character i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes but he is a	 3.683831133970901
jane certainly could not come back	 3.179654679381468
you provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies	 3.6335688411700295
mrs philipss supper party but his manners recommended him to every	 3.8669947538963925
and so was i	 3.415993147197005
little eager to be alone and fearful of enquiries or hints from her	 4.2089082988026165
successively entered the world but yet the son was to come and mrs	 3.772967012003789
of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her	 4.564470138043238
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most	 4.035060245686065
or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others	 3.235001680798742
oh do not repeat what i then said these recollections will not do at	 4.2806096820112
in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away	 3.0616462508038724
surprised you could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within	 4.327262922224156

displeasure at this representation of them let it give you	 4.24013685922989
bennet this moment and help her on with her gown never mind miss	 3.568342355433376
well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never	 3.5494195430411657

the day there and mrs forster promised to have a little dance in the	 3.486350021656622
jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern she knew but little	 3.0445968275459916
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result	 3.4753324673884536
which she might in future be able to dispense	 3.1215434055904874
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the	 4.185043916983238
generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told	 3.7688437585061276
he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising	 4.052686318144756
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings	 4.505371291684187

no no you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i	 3.0101013137790846
you are then resolved to have him	 3.1424570068225193
your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned	 3.8955822998035536
elizabeth looked surprised the gentleman experienced some change of	 3.1437300966211206
hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls though	 4.339857463095273
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly	 3.420599142525765

whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion	 3.7363430886371756
what should not you mind	 3.8227712894247667
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening	 3.9820918148112865
distinguished by his sisters jane was as much gratified by this as her	 3.392141974454816
and much selfgratulation on the prospect of a connection between the	 4.211302017401015

of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on	 4.019028215508191

circumstancesand he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me	 5.955913660622561
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal	 4.7314166358177925

what her anxiety for his life had been before	 3.509198996258823
almost no restrictions whatsoever you may copy it give it away or	 2.4367176889378808
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion	 4.025442423536051
way his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her	 4.531402191024146
their journey gave them directions as to the best method of packing	 3.739415232393385
satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been	 3.261207454933159
how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions	 3.054098366892222
a creature as ever livedand her nieces are very pretty behaved girls	 3.576237248712823
mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while	 3.799368453457192

desirous of believing her indifferent is certainbut i will	 3.262495638622477
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through	 5.555291706600171
i am sure i shall break mine said lydia	 3.0915653593350982
with such a family and this consideration leads me moreover to	 3.634919462547407
suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the	 5.539117230086365
north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her	 3.877808217539325
paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected on the	 3.8494630407655075
lasting convenience of that kind but perhaps his sister does as well	 3.6157254149694893

this was his plan of amendsof atonementfor inheriting their fathers	 4.855057294487689
society of her two friends and the attentions of their brother and	 3.436018372769812

regret that he came	 3.5460102976266468
it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added	 3.2280472602716936
but she had no reason to fear mr and mrs gardiners curiosity it was	 3.761910704638688
little and mr hurst nothing at all the former was divided between	 3.9579904364727114

mr bingley arrived mrs bennet through the assistance of servants	 2.975248512596125
determined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets	 3.3794219755051427
she came into kent again she would be staying there too his words	 3.901405820573827
mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her	 3.2478117717244595

mrs reynoldss respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this	 3.7549132342763154
had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his	 3.3529032420998752
wickhams attentions there could be no conversation in the noise of	 3.339445389352059

among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the	 3.9063717382425978
could she think without feeling that she had been blind partial	 3.4307462132272053
time much better no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can	 4.467426277806876
women better worth their notice let us hope therefore that her being	 3.47781731993604
to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece	 3.4507956338583905
conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the	 3.7723364600402456
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw	 3.250918745442212
that he is always here so often it is on your account that he has been	 3.6796453332837973

mrs annesley is with her the others have been gone on to scarborough	 3.4348395222012673
but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of	 3.3092487453585027

might be won in the course of the evening but in an instant arose the	 4.1166734037202986
the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the	 3.8447126800025218
conversation though it was only on its being a wet night and on the	 3.8215233804183786
disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man it might seem as if	 3.265106252506897
he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walked towards	 3.500138429270228
yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of	 3.960576688394284
these transports by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr	 5.709573750313165

uncommon advantage the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a	 4.227381976401034
industriously circulated by yourselves do you not know that such a	 3.6965346460207944
wickham you must be very happy it is a great comfort to have you	 4.567980125766077

what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud	 3.6505682598528115

quite escaped my notice	 3.563909537914285
true it will be wise in me to refrain from that but do not imagine	 5.308016960277476
the defence of some little peculiar vexation	 3.3785304599633594
her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner	 4.4200826515853455
serious tone that he is improved in essentials	 4.514482716510034
approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to	 3.7193809247586964

even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave	 3.2952800526320303

seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at	 3.604499417218374

to accept them is absolutely impossible my feelings in every respect	 3.2687394360502244
hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs bennets civilities	 3.9667944185071735

would perhaps be called resentfulmy good opinion once lost is lost	 3.3641618832275935

into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding	 3.130348947196056
looked that way	 3.7782785032631074
something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty as	 4.443851746309175
to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy	 3.4556143079891988
children of his own and may have more how could he spare half ten	 3.8892570153260957

you must not blame my aunt lydias thoughtlessness first betrayed to	 3.2762818332908927

chapter viii	 1.9070367688535859
yes very well i saw them the night before last	 3.3298632364585834
to counterbalance these advantages mr darcy had considerable patronage	 4.233146207919458
believing what i say i wish you very happy and very rich and by	 3.7033477682646834
his daughters request for such it might be considered of being	 3.4190784086607526
enough to leave her room elizabeth was glad to be taken to her	 3.597993905492161
was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and	 3.846942294117409
that there was much affection in the case	 3.729572224742435
illtempered man wickham only shook his head	 3.526851898704143
i have not already heard give me farther particulars what did colonel	 2.9454457346130067
her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him	 3.6235349893884043
to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of	 4.527208991555005

experienced many hardships of that nature but in matters of greater	 4.385062216223893
longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard it	 4.235848538924974
introduce his friend mr wickham who had returned with him the day	 3.5710616085610583
elizabeth that if left wholly to himself janes happiness and his	 3.2490210413325142
he hardly knew how to look and they entered the house	 3.7086668068247324
took place they must have seen them together for ever	 3.311098600177441
stairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her she opened the	 4.099795382928076
yes there can for mine is totally differentwill you hear it	 4.181310218299799
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for	 4.458393448996087
temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydias example she	 3.4321520432775574
my dear jane make haste and hurry down he is comemr bingley is	 3.4650770776528583

and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother said mr gardiner	 3.541044869067961
and mary king is safe added elizabeth safe from a connection	 4.894341605032997
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence she was convinced that	 3.0876548412247122
there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her	 4.7587105308525395
business never since reading janes second letter had she entertained	 3.2438814671575757
valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some	 4.293277863264446

world i love and he is an angel i should never be happy without	 4.480108306007527
mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of	 4.492431301168244
your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your	 4.20364736264956
where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has	 3.5294176132032344
triumph the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of	 3.5339178572148495
indeed mama you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her	 4.788217870196139
time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings and it was now heightened	 5.508053588002958
and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman maam	 3.806682776405554
home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers there was	 4.925394363455561
i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest	 3.2920578393138036
three straws about her who could about such a nasty little freckled	 4.220986781999256
marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he	 3.4629437667587597
intimidate me	 3.155643696360769
soon afterwards ordered her carriage upon this signal the youngest of	 3.5206044246912773

housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the	 4.1647046488898365

former prejudices had been removed	 3.832424062173873

mr collinss return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of	 3.4887057644677446
enough for expectation	 3.789925197587458
very unexpectedfor your housekeeper she added informed us that	 3.1349485781786655
trifling colds she will be taken good care of as long as she stays	 3.6349299222222755
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that	 3.66149633238275
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run	 3.4570074433990228
well mamma said she when they were all returned to the breakfast	 4.125137189709602

unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often	 3.311582239639132
my dear aunt this is being serious indeed	 3.165249507338595

such recollection befriended her she could see him instantly before	 4.009546385759709
gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her	 4.596278301321643
remember eliza that he does not know janes disposition as you do	 3.7235062930867806
and her ideas were nearly worn out before the têteàtête was over on	 4.122646084683401

quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend	 4.133552570757273
miss bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr	 3.2738671371455332
kinder than towards myself	 3.280346793563592
she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind	 4.796403955975759
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the	 4.292597125987781

bingley if she could but lizzy oh sister it is very hard to think	 3.20946499915746
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody	 3.7879941858839623

the room or the number of couples	 3.4943678378100267
i hope not so imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be	 4.399532247406573
shortly relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by	 4.8931985832953915
and conceit unfortunately an only son for many years an only child	 3.503079379469842

good god what is the matter cried he with more feeling than	 3.086619058832012
home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor mr	 3.8667037547269367
gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire	 3.496781526121463
elizabeth coloured and saida little	 4.02881981466426
wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is	 5.002282771243873
but if you have got them today said elizabeth my mothers purpose	 3.540982979321639

my dear mr bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of	 3.6523613677167
to be married	 3.7203732912527916
on as a point of duty pardon me for neglecting to profit by your	 4.448579397659903

in this room they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there	 3.404815618976941
all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydia determined if	 3.742149802489527
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother mrs bennet	 3.802680572910451

would have taken up their abode with her at length however our	 4.118011842913053
their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine	 3.6371642278367267

finer county in england than derbyshire	 3.7698963471697873
you i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine i believe nobody	 3.245738414183525
even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife	 4.58057551545117
lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a	 3.145053886711947
morning they were therefore to goelizabeth was pleased though	 3.668957114570122
admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did but	 4.082121263038983
for her sister and resentment against all the others to carolines	 3.6931579971393114
added to its exuberance she was now in an irritation as violent from	 4.838943059331339
you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of	 3.7247682045132007

their wish of seeing mr and mrs gardiner and miss bennet to dinner	 4.004466553876874
husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me but	 3.426830135214504
and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into	 3.5672359771486932

four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him she endeavoured to	 3.8253611342103375
going thither but charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan	 4.278024713470578
towards him and said	 3.3691832742044854
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the	 4.590790156421432
be able to do so lady catherines great attentions to mrs collins you	 3.843062088216459
instrument is a capital one probably superior toyou shall try it	 3.8739363663267334
and may i ask said elizabeth but the terms i suppose must be	 3.675205460125197
better feeling to worldly advantage charlotte the wife of mr collins	 3.243205633702999
want of attention to other peoples feelings and want of resolution	 3.473956526459266
dont keep coughing so kitty for heavens sake have a little	 3.6196956636281774
but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this	 3.9118242114593906
preference	 1.962759145445629
conversation with colonel forster	 3.3226149622465426
do you really think so cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment	 3.473774872144477
information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting	 3.4399828485856405
all i am prodigiously proud of him i defy even sir william lucas	 3.891782005841172
to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life	 3.406292019182644
whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the	 4.815754051708495
minutes with him in his library he had entertained hopes of being	 4.079708558352778
to spread at meryton	 3.8843612061291424
herself began scolding one of her daughters	 3.208774245428299
you will not i hope consider me as shewing any disrespect to your	 3.9467279623616722
impression i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such	 3.8982292484848746
i assure you the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw the	 3.3540283536745625

apologising for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with	 3.688314859561432
they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth	 3.5251803774709183
kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry	 3.352046945122811

after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words	 3.2472425122192945
they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in and her	 3.428162663486145
longer the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will	 3.979213855027341
darcys opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and	 4.396302499426684
every thing being settled between them mr darcys next step was	 3.1280332893361074
to this mary very gravely replied far be it from me my dear sister	 3.2606888202489586
with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all	 3.7953982529777335
follows	 1.962759145445629
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get	 3.7044893812877917
temper i ever met with i often tell my other girls they are nothing to	 3.0379243391985784
you going much farther	 3.505596123478076

syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or any thing	 3.504630122866197
mother you deserve no such attention i am most seriously displeased	 3.2206102888541253
too long and too well to be a fair judge it is impossible for me to	 4.1610805207109856

this young man will influence her we live in so different a part of	 3.15832868199167
the marriage of her sisters he bore with philosophy the conviction that	 4.390262254886829
contempt it appeared to her merely the suggestion of carolines	 3.4557123980009874
this roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being	 3.2211217212986156
much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestowhow much of	 3.886352215621441
to that horrid man mr stone and then you know when once they get	 3.8642033302683725
forward and precipitate but i can assure the young ladies that i come	 3.792414982919017

a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to	 3.7051024246368462
impression on them elizabeth would not observe her and when at last	 3.7885360009981097
easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an	 3.951014004610443
effect	 3.6410681006924497

whose eagerness for their cousins appearance would not allow them to	 3.6232025243016706
yesthat is what makes it amusing had they fixed on any other man	 3.895879930099455
dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring	 4.554060488165312
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted	 3.5154719023089496

all worth pleasing so high and so conceited that there was no enduring	 3.683960042148053
have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the	 3.550145345999352
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in	 4.2815124399925395
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of	 3.4250552610379983
bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage	 4.249053194156112
it was time to be at home	 3.3848084398052936
gloomy elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it her power	 3.117616856725566
said he how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to sayyou	 3.734823901441893
meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they	 3.3237732231139074
i believe him to be lady catherines nephew it will be in my power to	 3.6432788971657963
and i ought to feel it	 3.5848437416621923
so much the better i hope they will not meet at all but does not jane	 2.9460219854352094
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied say	 4.265520862311345
may have drawn him in	 4.229310860613093
person and address that can captivate a woman	 3.9450659074457266
him	 3.06225890666125
very difficult my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to	 4.571683196675546
say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud	 3.1683571267563124
but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white	 3.7653385835200988

known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage	 4.390393764366786
would be insupportable your sisters are engaged and there is not	 3.759729917156739
of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the	 3.7079841005640652
consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner	 3.553426765408922

mr bennets property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two	 3.199713107487435
which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her or with a mind so	 4.179568070695608

after welcoming their sisters they triumphantly displayed a table set	 4.284758178371373
doubly engaged on one hand collecting an account of the present	 3.1994049116904795
elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his	 4.10095586333593
and keeps her room could she exert herself it would be better but	 4.170414389355386
understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and	 3.902920151060156
consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match i thought it my duty	 4.797069181613192
my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley	 2.935984253567907
then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike	 5.811499333839929
deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that	 3.682094619413678
his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride	 3.9778139855051244

after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last	 4.009678028532412
there was a motive within her of good will which could not be	 3.111613862164525

introduction had been made	 3.841666300148252
imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to	 3.7708473959247453
settlement there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming	 4.322681668267435
that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she	 3.336533361409832
that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her	 3.579428471181689
when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant	 3.317457764887628
she was engaged one day as she walked in reperusing janes last	 3.3510518362439585
she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale with	 5.0230120613145015
i do not believe a word of it my dear if he had been so very	 3.3691430375048386
standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and	 4.3220666444457505
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink the	 4.534570651068191

oh yesdo let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be	 4.194940974386216
i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have	 3.9510671998429143

console and nothing appease hernor did that day wear out her	 3.336493238501166
oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him	 3.1619673893159805

more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account	 3.884148524130221
it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out	 3.053372360982459

he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each	 4.354613508430667
having him but let me advise you to think better of it i know your	 3.983464408559867

the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly on	 3.9051386684826372
but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said jane	 3.334226305316061
they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a	 3.8341510527040064

the scheme every part of it would have been perfect	 3.7137984336753527
hard to have her taken such a way from me they are gone down to	 3.7179927624862197

well my dear said mr bennet when elizabeth had read the note	 3.0363086206128833
she seems a very pleasant young woman said bingley	 3.380480476255833
lady catherine opened the doors into the diningparlour and	 3.2594874173194697
be his meaningand asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand	 3.4984566799412797
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions	 3.1415763761021838

round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were	 4.169962416499432
hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing	 4.565433591832354
countenance expressed real security such a circumstance could only	 3.78997851713391
darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily	 3.7977120215354807

i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had	 3.3485447824940686

fairly conjectured from that though elizabeth who was by this time	 3.897297692566023
she found that she was to receive no other answerand after a short	 4.483120541742706
with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia	 3.578276064382208

i flatter myself that my present overtures of goodwill are highly	 4.4976879469437145

often at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him	 4.158317235087502
left you conditionally only and at the will of the present patron	 4.045457818838834
with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it	 3.4552570236915976
no more have i said mr bennet and i am glad to find that you do	 4.055782350903111
aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming i can now	 5.383692962333193
was almost incredible it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously	 4.336862152853267
frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty	 3.3439441699868357
which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the roommany	 3.628894159756105
resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her	 4.463681694722972
distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at	 4.474107889992045
the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived	 4.636425028685331
his constancy if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might	 3.852988238008056

packed up good bye give my love to colonel forster i hope you	 3.2994380726134307
you are mistaken i write rather slowly	 2.822282497836265
you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her allow me by the	 3.35476889513103
disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest	 4.2671930310479915
soon dispatched for though dilatory in undertaking business he was	 4.7540749040952015
at four oclock therefore we may expect this peacemaking gentleman	 3.308970739989008
of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself he was a tall	 4.457440391304047
who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her	 3.336747737527695
with these requirements we do not solicit donations in locations	 3.951756078728063
it the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you we know	 3.464908582411989
she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse	 3.82109020919294
not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and	 3.4808868257707863

doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea it is as	 4.060913473858305
but you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviour as	 4.367439729758927
herself was entirely insensible of the evil elizabeth had frequently	 4.513513131238476
i shall be very fit to see janewhich is all i want	 4.635141622898655
continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown	 3.145298862628039
you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins for she vows she will	 3.7056021556240246
will wait on him of course	 3.733602348072508
janes delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to	 3.6560820807747536
these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted instead of	 3.811959452612788

seeking him up stairs with their mother when they were met by the	 3.504782966614086
you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep	 3.4715281855696807
belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the	 5.7513907893920875
other and not disturb us with his company what shall we do with him	 3.426691799871629
an exhibition	 2.819713057387654
fine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her they	 4.251268672128391
but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure they are	 4.331290799620971
would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her	 4.0482764666103055
she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her	 3.451495196581129
oh shocking cried miss bingley i never heard any thing so	 3.4035880439918555
because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a	 4.303512463560223
they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her mothers	 3.9823569681954165
oddly	 1.962759145445629
then turning to mr bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at	 4.16110344191143
but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of	 4.951279321601269
and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear	 3.3096006005179794
sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they	 3.712411418309139
cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london well he is a	 3.819579880997976
never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting	 3.7877320302394164
you are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of your	 3.526658880835524
of so many	 3.894637711165299
own judgment of her situation the note was immediately dispatched and	 3.4021211992068263
she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down he	 4.283106356572009
the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect	 3.291955420879924
however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to	 3.7141296447167416
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case	 3.881032243653679
was at netherfield i hope your plans in favour of the shire will	 3.4712486913763065
power of reading again i can remember some expressions which might	 3.3186438821014894
present i have not room to do them justice	 3.9954819859654584
of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family	 3.3151730551751415
school and an establishment formed for her in london and last	 3.28766496249135
opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily	 3.3703962231888087
how you must have hated me after that evening	 4.0597348152898896
of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree	 3.9844315278515907
the indirect boastfor you are really proud of your defects in	 4.251562583951063
behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of	 3.9613581080721385
friend met her with every appearance of composure elizabeth merely	 3.374375959395799
insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of	 3.492646574221017
there	 3.3715866064714266
too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a	 4.67559113826547
pretty sittingroom lately fitted up with greater elegance and	 3.8870158592805257
i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a	 3.25199541760464
opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody	 5.091510502400107
called and afterwards dined here why especially when you called did	 3.216656366652613
it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that	 3.6973959454904652
in any other person present the supposition did not pain her she liked	 3.6664832204258038
elizabeth looked archly and turned away her resistance had not	 3.788035401129552
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every	 4.670170588717382
in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and	 3.451739658115666
jane on their first arrival at lambton and this disappointment had	 3.771182870850575
bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart	 3.5477162976985706
the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always	 3.7329508712508273
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it	 4.229839349665853

however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his	 3.903676632484732
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily it was really a very	 4.34371132730178

collection despite these efforts project gutenbergtm electronic	 3.3187550747911967
while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether	 3.597541795182114
nobody feels for my poor nerves	 4.347358666285581
nothing more to plague her on his account	 4.7942800839679345
was very obstinate i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real	 4.497524154493241
friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in	 3.2627366390409
well as of mr darcy his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned	 3.7678641110797093
oh my dear lydia she cried when shall we meet again	 2.8607517405999463

you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means	 3.994241200316647
reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined if he	 3.5922685083554486
could not help answering herbut she said he seemed very angry at	 3.6752088351039216
i do not believe mrs long will do any such thing she has two nieces	 3.0062260141222494
pretty kind of girl she asked her at different times how many sisters	 3.431637207298552
in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant	 3.81450322574574
youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming	 3.6595758345901257
regulars thank heaven he has some friends though perhaps not so	 3.706101818866099
good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of	 4.902005556091352
she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy by the	 3.7431053929113394
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man but whether she	 4.830704753707696
mr bingley does not know mr wickham himself	 3.3457713066770207
darcys progress through his book as in reading her own and she was	 3.526352555778039
a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have	 3.24587197935915
moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took	 3.3384703104531264
other had ever seen him bingley of course returned with him to dinner	 3.5085098334017144
you have actually seen pemberley	 3.651560191791749
this was a lucky recollectionit saved her from something like regret	 4.111773027978215

elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked	 4.590081944763719
what he had related himself and the kindness of the late mr darcy	 3.2954833815246944
visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss	 3.838431822278463
he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia	 3.2375330127403528
it out but i hardly know what i have written	 4.2130354730305335
of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly	 4.657825048323056

answer let me do it without farther loss of time accept my thanks for	 3.154939412558036
i have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to his being	 3.304708534534488
much more than to any other person in the room	 3.4569694388457664
affection every moment more valuable	 3.295226948526918

his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father	 3.315952902922988
lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her	 3.4603360319927465
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a	 3.7686354537604
doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was	 3.856906155527836
they returned down stairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were	 3.275835804849885

indeed you are mistaken madam i have not been at all able to account	 3.3667686578095117
junior was left to the guardianship of my mothers nephew colonel	 3.8813213698646023

oh yes pray read on	 2.9780611350416617
invitation	 5.04821051007261
in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an	 3.7698688438981365
and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be	 4.084419819347348
greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally	 3.896112808694757
jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told that he	 4.0843879812251
the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from	 4.220431592688405
how much civility on that ladys side the acquaintance would now be	 3.4160766501392956
i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as	 3.9523599751413334
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him in	 4.312364587595132
was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered	 3.7673299821594233
towards him they are even impartial towards miss king i cannot find	 3.7095288632342025
expose himself to such a man mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained	 4.22426948066464
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me	 4.19443335877766
and how impossible in others	 3.1664208818030755
all cared about me we must have met long long ago he knows of my	 3.5984808275607865
distance was a beautiful object every disposition of the ground was	 4.519528304131553
total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed	 3.865084390072673
that is all settled	 2.943639910842869

i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a	 3.9439319613134036
together but enough of this you alluded to something else you	 3.549746641625279
but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sisters	 3.488759121663363
can be no occasion for your going so soon mrs bennet could certainly	 3.3492755610414684
history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have	 3.469984627335311
may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married	 3.287152980130119
leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable	 3.9514499354381987
mind charlotte tried to console her	 3.661041412355562
perhaps we might be deceived	 3.51071749145736
i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every	 3.8787581088737184
pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs	 3.9092302446323823
honour or credit could now be purchased for her the satisfaction of	 3.7801574210152324
their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing	 3.905946424003399
regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their	 3.7645188385455923
conversation beginning with his parsonagehouse and leading naturally	 5.134181041318322
prove so for else they will be destitute enough things are settled so	 3.5471487680996288
pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her	 3.2982890294949896
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the	 3.54277350944606
at mr darcy there is a fine old saying which every body here is of	 3.680772841428419
i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not	 3.682967670715377
she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had	 4.707226617517341
turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated	 4.023217387385372
humility it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an	 3.3092356557362996
me for she does not know which are the best warehouses oh brother	 3.8389911716265157
whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is	 4.213404053467807
assure you there are many amiable young women but the fact is that	 2.967933750875558
first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her	 3.7180776096337236
family never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified	 3.5187563883343116
lambton elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated it	 3.240800290936834
between the mercenary and the prudent motive where does discretion end	 3.890717189217516
eyes	 4.063932194799581
one point on which i want your advice i want to be told whether i	 3.5640082109462945
have you any other objection said elizabeth than your belief of my	 3.485578993738756
agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it i am	 3.1895389251480775
by one spirit every thing relating to their journey was speedily	 4.261192146452539
i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time i	 3.8968772140487813
eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twentyseven	 3.621668230017709
ayethat is because you have the right disposition but that	 3.3860244511970587
who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctuality as	 3.977280312566445
forster it will be quite a shame if he does not	 4.0381785902357965
thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they	 3.547004717496659
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings	 4.542523569609112
mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of	 3.1675452898410934
i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us it was more	 3.0843559649011985
lydia whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such	 4.331493184173105
of that when they fall in love	 4.653552718074155
which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving	 3.7825905726738216
assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an	 3.848118662173669
mine i must beg therefore to be importuned no farther on the	 4.622029670977298
and angry with herself for being so	 3.6193774598210564
elizabeth herself	 3.510157253748265
when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply	 3.2357799246758234
yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especiallya	 3.856709258280473
visit the gentlemen arrived early and before mrs bennet had time to	 3.6593761159512224
first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to	 3.394124451272771
little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a	 3.8544270628060158
and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin	 3.363682455183672
delight as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation to know	 4.810323446386629
hunsford near westerham kent	 3.551585652296419
you must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth	 3.4361045110514437
lydia were far from envying miss lucas for mr collins was only a	 4.199416657803007
moment alighted from his horse or his carriage she blushed again and	 4.095045706739486
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly	 3.997473774314852
pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel	 4.022565348088083
approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed	 4.631046067438247
pemberley	 3.3099052892417857
hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was	 3.051402703377379
unconnected with his general powers about ten or a dozen years ago	 3.3512044302215345
of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have	 3.320284300453079
contain a denial	 2.8138183724342167
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter	 3.9758574765847863
for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a great	 4.165193807823552
sir william staid only a week at hunsford but his visit was long enough	 3.4441747435692265
printed for t egerton	 2.4389690338814876
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but	 3.536738563401417
his mother as well as of hers while in their cradles we planned	 4.417397197222325
ease cannot write ill	 3.926264618394211
into a hackneycoach and dismissed the chaise that brought them	 4.77334831990216
1e1 the following sentence with active links to or other immediate	 4.346415164259499
with hermiss darcy the daughter of mr darcy of pemberley and lady	 3.838361784830714
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mothers	 3.696502468396459
stairs these two girls had been above an hour in the place happily	 3.3980006704466796
resolvednor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the	 3.7003120663060867
all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt that	 3.792537103707449
cheeks and she said	 2.9856520672095392
received the work on a physical medium you must return the medium with	 4.613935083818432
as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment	 4.218175073675242
and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would	 3.171659002430436
curious to hear how it was managed	 3.8143382464681648
neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model there is not a	 3.964177702465777
such another man for you	 3.6032071291707
well and what news does it bring good or bad	 3.1470229320571455
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it she immediately felt	 4.164515465070987
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week	 3.6535883847825197
observation whichever were the case though her opinion of him must be	 4.100770824305013
rosings i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it	 4.148801783608422
their affectionate mother shared all their grief she remembered what	 4.60643724105808
but he added you will of course wish to have your humble respects	 3.3701063404098175
it elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed	 5.092394824351561
case	 3.967253635215023
do you prefer reading to cards said he that is rather singular	 3.563360131339338
they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and mrs bennet in	 3.6542369325121293
fitzwilliam darcy	 3.932515776330732
affair became public	 3.662441693912726
reserve can be answerable for the event but in spite of all this	 4.542871375014664
opportunities to fix the problem	 2.6511685902364026
she when he knows who they are he takes them now for people of	 3.7956622028933924
i have said no such thing i am only resolved to act in that manner	 4.236020906463429
i am not afraid of you said he smilingly	 2.9155184917998764
catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying	 3.1818894783674754
seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the	 3.2474377879678498
elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour at	 3.1382388135866717
but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my	 4.698856391028236
only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his	 3.5547012079785834
agreeable than his companion expected there was nothing of presumption	 3.5915608061709716
but before they heard again from mr gardiner a letter arrived for	 3.3864114751477663
circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour	 4.428636686631319
by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may	 4.334459661831745
some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it	 3.971934479129499
hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again today	 3.149753936305763
millars regiment went away i thought i should have broke my heart	 4.131250180081109
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty but if	 4.028267996782622
her twice only think of that my dear he actually danced with her	 3.4920927605170227
pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited	 3.5109692651520454
ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly	 3.6361578751194448
disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated	 3.363996838322215
but think and think with wonder of mr darcys civility and above	 3.655321928802594
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every	 5.073287525527754
addressed herself particularly to mr bingley to assure him how happy	 3.715650116065406
enquiry after the health of her family she answered with equal	 2.899142801173612
good health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after the	 3.2038518165822287
extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others	 3.1746824756213923
calmelizabeths courage did not fail her she had heard nothing of	 4.524214138296447
preceded it were familiar to them as it was certain however that	 4.470463041586722
that noble place charles when you build your house i wish it may be	 3.743546844306981
chapter i	 2.8537181665873153
what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many	 4.080323213795747
by mrs collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter	 3.16265384189872
husband called out as she entered the library	 3.6946606117274285
your first position is false they may wish many things besides his	 3.234598341381318
with a large party nothing could be more delightful to be fond of	 3.182068846172395
you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the	 3.459883786141233
impertinence your uncle is as much surprised as i amand nothing	 3.6358890345729105
there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must	 3.4857368323017894
him more favourably spoken of by any one	 3.5267131403838663
on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be	 3.8497477595443743
very agreeable and i give you leave to like him you have liked many a	 3.3690455462580666
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report	 3.5976450683594745
set off together bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to	 3.5454478049360643
aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose	 4.501326590807977
during their walk it was resolved that mr bennets consent should be	 3.283772120313659
for one half hour	 3.3746620923476964
errors of her daughter must be principally owing	 3.698522953056868
but what said she after a pause can have been his motivewhat	 3.424078093532342
she is almost three and twenty lord how ashamed i should be of not	 3.4218677624537066
she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through	 3.467391031398672
can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good	 3.2429044777947222
choose to be you shall not find me so my character has ever been	 3.5874906760371448
two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a very particular	 3.5659401988904205
an hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there	 3.813146892295022
other provocations you know i have had not my own feelings decided	 3.7597440352704843
been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way i wonder who first	 4.255746990527895
e gardiner	 2.812220141666139
do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place	 3.9249704335708495
always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest	 3.831203428177066
way and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again	 3.5510807051422426
seated herself	 4.501130332533533
reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a	 3.015108057022173
charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her	 3.28944702548617
then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said mrs	 3.444955341575692
the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their	 3.895126690256355
ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it	 4.1446410916662995
no i believe not	 3.315919213073182
ask for compassion her home and her housekeeping her parish and her	 4.48623792480655
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement	 3.6592506267737304
have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you	 4.328467964582402
i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate if it was	 3.687854641318835
how tired i am accompanied by a violent yawn	 4.14925715026562
should meet	 3.967559868549823
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjustany thing that spoke him	 4.996176535204084
being agreeable where they chose it but proud and conceited they were	 3.398745449781859
scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning but	 3.8097368419014286
to determine	 4.164491450489343
the highest kind they soon outstripped the others and when they had	 3.869183810545947
fish she had won and mr collins in describing the civility of mr and	 4.278938104831577
arisen of mr darcy and their niece directed their observation towards	 3.2988713869469115
that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of	 3.797935398740724
miss darcy was expected to dinner i wish i could see her my visit was	 3.2383798190442574
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own	 3.9910813481386493
it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr bennet and	 3.5513513074051515
oh noit is not for me to be driven away by mr darcy if he	 4.3997973074085985
complied with	 2.892287041243816
could most wish for and now do when you get to town find them out	 3.3444995873685537
extreme and continually was she repeating why is he so altered from	 3.2296187431512817
yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight do	 3.108721136192311
i have not a doubt of mr bingleys sincerity said elizabeth warmly	 3.102957712622343
telling again what had been already written and when it closed	 3.715385801056536
out well at such a distance as that you know things are strangely	 3.6772217798011217
reflections is a very common failing i believe by all that i have	 4.052507924323596
bingley what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself	 3.8165432850917704
lydia bennet	 4.000185510717991
has she been presented i do not remember her name among the ladies at	 3.810457111072271
we may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as	 3.706964635599584
her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances the	 3.1629239695997176
finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a	 3.491687893697212
as he joined her	 3.4037701092155266
possible	 3.72797775264408
must have been benefited by marriage but he found in reply to	 3.438955833404833
eveningelizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment	 3.6786433673499794
meet mr darcyshe felt all the perverseness of the mischance that	 3.7645742667681286
the room and this is always the way with him she addedwhatever	 3.6929357101366866
sir william did not say much he was storing his memory with anecdotes	 4.307670244278669
many months ago from mr wickham on this subject what can you have to	 3.8158321686018155
this is quite shockinghe deserves to be publicly disgraced	 4.148321386013312
is that his design in settling here	 3.612221433965956
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the	 3.3996783392175485
by other men you had better return to your partner and enjoy her	 3.5565081591935024
him he now wished it more than ever had he done his duty in that	 3.032016680011286
her deference for his opinion	 3.8965166065123094
chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on	 3.1443526142884526
thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me we must not	 3.6343158748168376
she accordingly read and elizabeth who knew what curiosities his	 3.474755309513907
lizzy said her father i have given him my consent he is the kind	 3.535979817283895
his brotherinlaws intreaty that he would return to his family and	 4.513633779080576
the case and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed	 3.662762433654511
bingley if he had been imposed on would have much to suffer when the	 3.7363132102231504
wonder nor condemn but the belief of his selfconquest brought nothing	 4.723470308322435
my dear harriet	 3.0647964355461994
be traced to prideand pride has often been his best friend it has	 3.8860623370597334
render mr darcys conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a	 3.150755522924678
and fainter and in farther justification of mr darcy she could not	 4.395121944836794
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would	 3.4985595587466
at length however his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of	 3.556920673674667
suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his	 3.4293636337680735
cold was their manner whenever they did her mothers ungraciousness	 3.2404197746304657
with every body and had so many favourites	 3.4996531261702315

indeed i am i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier	 3.4621686212685843
i am not now to learn replied mr collins with a formal wave of the	 3.5535741547266175
endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and	 4.434937915784304

train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to	 3.696310197212918
exceedingly as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its	 4.014941486121463
well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingleybutgood	 3.836269849180513
to do something or other about it	 3.3110837776846713
should now escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope of	 3.757065254339611
wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them	 3.196344888154514
moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had	 4.055633333511761
lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in	 3.9008692205156916
building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of high	 5.714986874795745
with less perplexity her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what	 4.2805140965526425
the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the	 4.3790716792106865
though it was not put in as it ought to be it was only said lately	 4.087074574479653
1e4 do not unlink or detach or remove the full project gutenbergtm	 3.731345415722088
that we never let them know what has been said against him we must	 3.5922344101210126
wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for	 3.500158093673685
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the	 4.297327360638784
selfdestined to another	 3.7062883869969743
others she had very little notice from any but him miss bingley was	 3.316134513785555
you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this i see	 4.471128734875398
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated	 3.6197555038280216
i care about it though he is nothing to us you know and i am sure	 3.5086996392070957
pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of	 3.6721707235618726
you observed it mr darcy i am sure said miss bingley and i am	 4.005817794937416
into the country to give a ball at netherfield	 3.5215153373393213
wickhams absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling	 3.655693145365045
revolted in his offer to herself what will be his surprise thought	 3.261466960193935
elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a	 3.6031438889183303
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer its windows	 4.470559399993896
is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would	 5.124212661522993
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast	 4.315903119980767
if elizabeth when mr darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to	 3.564177136729057
say you to the day i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well	 3.6662399505957253
till she could be foundelizabeth could but just affect concern in	 3.8427254123395826
looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity	 3.4292366816571533
momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed	 3.2689517820264427
application was a something to look forward to	 3.487303815398299
take care lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointment	 4.148277928978208
what sort of a girl is miss darcy	 3.678820175247311
yesterdayare you much acquainted with mr darcy	 3.078204834507931
this sad business of janes for my part i am determined never to speak	 3.269381079915108
it to be from a circulating library he started back and begging	 4.137806040854626
and now we are better	 3.8354763476617557
but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation	 3.5973395761079527
and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and	 3.134625988596361
trademark owner any agent or employee of the foundation anyone	 5.044432922905823
then who taught you who attended to you without a governess you must	 3.61693087200114
understood from the gardiners that you had	 3.856991320385603
individual work is in the public domain in the united states and you are	 3.409185214698022
wife may teach him i thought him very slyhe hardly ever	 3.7187111560031223
humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed up	 3.2606257019482974
his understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but	 3.7914347305917033
journey hither your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i	 3.701777326350279
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom	 3.7071183866268442

saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts now asked her if	 3.3633713102721683
and what is fifty miles of good road little more than half a days	 3.227164382889643
it is not quite a week since they left brighton in a few days more we	 3.4300825283901837
remain freely available for generations to come in 2001 the project	 3.986709864522629
pair of ponies would be the very thing but i must write no more	 4.075264682884509
there was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her	 3.525486100044294
you are quite right to have his errors made public might ruin him for	 3.328931705120037
to me again by letter for the presentation his circumstances he	 3.8516367198096337
will not leave london before he has found them who is to fight wickham	 3.4516777443856297
that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth	 3.3531781139632457
offering his assistance as far as it would go but he found lydia	 3.4433996810221905
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him their eyes	 4.157936063049935
assisted by kittys hints and additions endeavour to amuse her	 4.2750595859905625
their three months acquaintance they had been intimate two	 3.6779933064090393
visitor did at last appear but the shortness of her stay and yet more	 4.04611767443103
she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her putting	 3.0172357722250687
probable consequence of her allusions to mr wickham and rejoiced in	 5.779646056416655
perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any	 3.225822117402574
heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his	 5.265571790645875
lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to	 4.7542262529552275
the neighbourhood in general was beyond the collinses reach this	 4.708427682813639
day her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long before it	 3.632477072923468
any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such	 3.7925839309362597
you cannot be more than twenty i am suretherefore you need not	 3.9397857768988964
not one	 3.420583932680846
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best	 3.3598294933594177
speak my mind and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling	 3.9185011328374846
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases	 3.4483880055650205
mr bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way you take	 3.594563295441362
reserve to mrs collins and whatever might be his feelings towards her	 3.5558779694831886
two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal	 4.302043741671708
the impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn	 3.2791373016965135
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge by this time she is	 3.824886469977456
assure you he informed me himself	 3.134117701202656
oh yes be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy say that	 4.137214586670393
dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house	 3.742545055653299
arrested herand she beheld a striking resemblance of mr darcy with	 4.827025190473161
jane who were dancing together recovering himself however shortly	 3.1052994344575438
in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and	 4.470631531710192
overtaken by wickham	 3.5039402796565646
that is all very proper and civil i am sure said mrs bennet and i	 3.7061349862873576
out of the room as they went down stairs together charlotte said	 3.179413315757349
wickham and herself jane listened with astonishment and concernshe	 3.048004792594489
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city	 3.208365312317738
being loved by her sister	 3.8914628513247207
she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her	 3.7628081804551115
to part us if he were so they could not succeed by supposing such an	 4.029414664467787
made her perhaps almost as happy as jane she saw her in idea settled in	 3.1654458482931966
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required	 4.6410624566060825
him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the	 4.177570692501624
subject to the trademark license especially commercial	 4.3653061563129665
came from it the coach therefore took them the first stage of their	 4.105638970321265
how kind you are i know you will contrive it all	 4.024306258809281
my dearest sister now be be serious i want to talk very seriously	 3.1750238389677947
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention he	 3.256328195547574
added i shall insist on their giving one also i shall tell colonel	 3.566635708946627
her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved	 3.270671941803969
me and teach you not to believe a word i say i am particularly unlucky	 3.626496274396642
opposite the front of his house it was a handsome modern building well	 3.9243280316833995
for the welfare of his friend	 3.276341915642277
<NUMBER> to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt	 3.630320353691996
i think she will she is now about miss elizabeth bennets height or	 3.213198736048543
i have an excessive regard for jane bennet she is really a very sweet	 2.972620945854991
i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship you	 3.7775365933343688
my dear niece	 3.340470970792806
the same her peace equally wounded	 3.257273848672664
likeness between the ladies miss de bourgh was pale and sickly her	 4.410596763703937
i am sick of mr bingley cried his wife	 3.6778996689724304
august 2	 2.1555682567671157
together in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the housekeeper	 4.235102942964854
copied or distributed	 2.6333871399303512
subject	 3.220114149658334
she is saving enough there is nothing extravagant in their	 3.741766517335332
succeeds but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art	 4.614094058170343
painful than elizabeths but whatever she felt she was desirous of	 4.027202289409308
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to	 4.5505648218773675
brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of	 4.099916325725938
they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them	 4.1549533027966445
mr darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was	 3.79871481947753
with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure	 4.00787329124783
default of heirs male on a distant relation and their mothers	 4.08934465093407
done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem her	 3.3619979741390247
bodythat is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy	 3.5716608480006804
ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three	 3.523735731883179
elizabeth would not oppose such an injunctionand a moments	 4.4963522931880435
elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book he was	 4.550274623655778
and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made	 4.301867840717535
to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she	 4.445396173407734
neighbourhood they shall never have admittance i will not encourage	 3.7009477994113835
four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge	 4.152446135029992
mr bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided	 3.2015955127482503
she is a very finelooking woman and her calling here was prodigiously	 3.4148191248132775
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examine	 3.4808425548058435
account for it	 3.9249521742785323
elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the	 3.5869139407769124
him it is because he will not give himself the trouble	 3.326082310472672
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent	 2.9830477167032976
which i have never acknowledged allowing the case however to stand	 3.8052254274109636
you will never get a husband at alland i am sure i do not know who is	 3.2023864152263664
to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through	 3.694627811414673
elopement i know it all that the young mans marrying her was a	 3.9783223814279607
you used us abominably ill answered mrs hurst in running away	 3.2609889463418544
aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused	 3.247559662529871
foolish	 1.962759145445629
saw him so affected poor kitty has anger for having concealed	 3.0876888605996218
jane was so admired nothing could be like it every body said how well	 3.206287438372597
darcy did not wish for cards and mr hurst soon found even his open	 3.859674231344943
their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance	 3.8000405580778627
made her look handsomer than ever kitty simpered and smiled and hoped	 3.3028255569816736
the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could	 4.810510855246152
entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of	 3.2063780897821497
he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped to interrupt	 5.356554376124456
the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five	 3.9499850663362364
replies they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the	 3.9684815994938267
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the	 4.787503540605655
their journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm and	 3.1928395443471587
it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their	 3.746827317444699
why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley i am	 3.4313334357919754
they returned to the rest of the family charlotte did not stay much	 3.378045745294022
deny the justice of his description of janeshe felt that janes	 4.8093823578990795
promised to write again very soon there was also a postscript to this	 3.572345934034049
in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that	 3.650795832446624
what to think	 3.5512177663157196
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what	 3.522466003897555
people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance	 3.245234531470204
though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his	 3.8551057496190166
there is also one other person in the party he continued after a	 3.0182257662650183
setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to	 3.564406598644876
considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least	 4.273208271232587
accident only could discover to mr bingley her sisters being in town	 4.294012964287695
your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was	 4.546801373872067
you are quite a visit in my debt mr bingley she added for when	 3.7385094579819396
but i cannot think so ill of him many circumstances might make it	 3.194406853305835
important elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr darcy	 3.882939488867009
pleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers and though this	 3.657550134280292
dear madam cried mrs hill in great astonishment dont you know	 3.661252534102261
she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains	 3.547980681300004
widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant	 3.863733688282455
after many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could not	 3.9066459919197736

nothing so easy if you have but the inclination said elizabeth we	 3.415955380516514

impossible not to long to know	 3.2530596505850142

she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and	 3.342497110596054

obtained and at the age of twentyseven without having ever been	 3.566739854136587
looked almost wild	 3.687419090854515

still different from either was what mr bennet sent to mr collins in	 3.692028326927044
considered how many peoples happiness were in his guardianshiphow	 3.8016223602060037
addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be	 3.1506145196400044

she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road	 4.595582576521143

pleasure realized a scheme of which every part promises delight can	 3.338055821547995
such societybut she had chosen it with her eyes open and though	 4.11270553270898
servants she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a	 4.4751300106884
house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted	 4.284159504294448
remarks of the two ladies and mr darcy the latter of whom however	 4.236863210099537
own daughters i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have	 3.969150998377837

which gave them meaning	 3.818794427143399
you liked her i hope she will turn out well	 3.440198308352957
a good journey and invited them to come to hunsford again next year	 3.3150213567436233
when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to	 3.3936901490215705
your written explanation the person or entity that provided you with	 4.020300546852189
back her ladyship was highly incensed	 3.635815773175259
seemed to imply it could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts	 3.8212429518853526
she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself and to	 3.2128518698425172
wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions	 4.150264810086959
in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in	 3.8800746164579034
and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way	 4.378888150137152
woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in	 4.361989863751345
elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the	 5.218016677934416
all copies of project gutenbergtm electronic works in your possession	 3.210307776972139
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane	 3.675194298146142
persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to	 4.6360727503757255
discussed except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention	 3.6423191262424464
you can but if i were you i would stand by the nephew he has	 4.339804240177954
must confess not that i mean to find fault with you for such things	 4.068659359333916
friend to join it	 3.6758643118491383
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive	 3.5703592003732054
lives for a whole days têteàtête between two women can never	 3.0892936092090038
consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to	 3.976978261554172
but so we all do it is only that he has better means of having it than	 3.3013100241554865
did not you i did for you but that is one great difference between	 3.5788305998480965
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt	 3.644892953526464
to improve myself for in my situation of life mrs philips was	 3.40230578852872
jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as	 4.017983160081329
the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw	 3.431292769986169
approve she comes to us today i shall write again as soon as any	 3.881872918665145
each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so	 3.817255674195055
precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies	 3.926813794675142
this ever induce me to be explicit	 3.768688984954709
boxes workbags and parcels and the unwelcome addition of kittys and	 3.216473138978517

came on to longbourn and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner	 4.985118070314751
the chief of it her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline	 3.6882667256186377
pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence	 3.8630835969569253
his character was decided he was the proudest most disagreeable man in	 4.212468327859307
which she chose to be insensible gaily continued oh mamma do the	 3.893283076551848
arranges the business just as he pleases	 2.9170463528317843

herself into the power ofof mr wickham they are gone off together	 3.646827130729128
feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me and so	 3.478550927447226
subject you may depend upon my seeking no further	 3.582329808576089
having very frequent parties at home these parties were acceptable to	 3.191621072881255
appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation	 3.5299846449712855
my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to	 4.839780358153225
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them	 4.57847928154755
myself and of mr wickham too he shall not be in love with me if i	 4.225223548611441
and was grateful to her uncle for saying	 3.261116904087501

evening party and he bore with the illjudged officiousness of the	 4.300910412816692
possible claim on me in the present instance no principle of either	 4.533703089247838
revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering	 4.0662667514994535
elizabeth turned away to hide a smile	 4.889108906413069
all means to refuse him	 3.9158384390063996
to be always so guarded and circumspect it is very often nothing but	 5.153800685312416
of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so	 3.323126284647357
and that is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his	 3.7046829777280386

room and what do you think of my husband is not he a charming man i	 3.388160736994634
not like ease whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing	 3.3859484127320094
come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had	 4.544853169817907
her father lifted up his eyes jane was distressed elizabeth looked	 3.804726689569705
elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said	 4.405437621053214
when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a	 4.4185488587308095
bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn	 3.6382425475803326
could not bear such suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paper	 4.205036186626155
it was to love of the ladys sensations they remained a little in	 4.394135955883137

chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same	 4.744459998417416
room in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her	 4.014424658700725
gardiners behaviour laid them all under	 3.9055627255618286
other they were not the only objects of mr collinss admiration the	 4.458302646659498
much wretched wretched mistake	 3.211031245460297

alacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir	 4.02856849792741
ladies were ready enough to talk and mr collins seemed neither in need	 3.734610945459017
always very short those to her mother contained little else than that	 3.613023662190105
should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five	 4.261181834696591
loved her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the	 3.374927373567846
soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her	 4.110600606278569
while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehensions of	 4.442519718713006

being spoke to	 3.6308188901739995
yes she called yesterday with her father what an agreeable man sir	 2.888459835882463
which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your	 4.61145984390744
readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming and the	 3.6266225984343907
for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in	 4.052267147442162
and jane seem so well to understand	 3.409556538831931
that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and	 3.9266129084302115
than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls	 4.144612230946501
mother both of whom had been dead many years it was possible however	 3.9928617892752203
too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their	 5.8837162182688045

carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a	 3.5032813211574214
generally is jane had been a week in town without either seeing or	 3.5887186440064505
displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter resignation to	 3.546581774683941
well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few	 4.327490975587459
all mrs long and her nieces must stand their chance and therefore as	 3.5918412294887077
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation	 4.120970761807357
neglect i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of	 3.208445394541259
the children have been wanting me this half hour yours very	 3.7324933903611734
lady lucas her report was highly favourable sir william had been	 2.9357365643130535
design nonsense how can you talk so but it is very likely that he	 3.951284279403166
able to see your friends before they leave the country but may we not	 3.0395505842941435
all	 3.552404699004643
treated you too and then when we came away it was such fun i thought	 3.671814872742068
him he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very	 3.3757287212690827
mr collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife	 3.0903674685382114
they had often attempted it before but it was a subject on which mrs	 3.7868926997373364
they went for neither lydia nor mr collins were once silent lydia	 3.1179398894179826
long letter but now having that to communicate which she knew would	 3.68042732413162
which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against	 3.4828210674397693
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance	 3.613277936847334
likes with her	 2.8455764875160914
ittill it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any	 3.2632987637373794
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great she knew not how to	 3.184295309487763
that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i	 5.048032415659752
changed as that implies	 3.5896939856073473
if one could but go to brighton observed mrs bennet	 2.986427148563965
to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family a promise	 4.267128222719377
cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style and which	 4.387817664576733
dissuaded from it i have not been used to submit to any persons whims	 3.8472393946648205
colonel fitzwilliams manners were very much admired at the parsonage	 3.7621466916021458
i can believe him capable if indeed it should be so but i dare not	 3.6497752108498376
enough to help anybody to coffee and then was enraged against herself	 4.927361718749129
she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her	 3.415827052578983
her eyes envied every one to whom he spoke had scarcely patience	 3.4008305563391357
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth	 3.6328525021362115
from you very soon miss bingley said something of his never	 3.7663722405844826
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and	 4.495360586261281
prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were	 3.486458865057131
those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what	 3.7938811505340224
yes all of them i think they all paint tables cover skreens and net	 4.136585568361831
believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he	 4.190440606260943
killed	 1.962759145445629
admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded	 3.9019425669855137
preparing to oblige the company by many significant looks and silent	 3.3456930236629026

far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with	 4.4149428000710484
defects such as but not limited to incomplete inaccurate or	 4.55826991726794
trouble of finding a subject to him	 3.3013622396587072
in contempt for it she was received however very politely by them	 3.579619914394118

but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed	 3.10720782228121
patchedup business at the expence of your father and uncles and is	 5.45347894186132
arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets and jane more especially	 4.395636744933626
begin freelya slight preference is natural enough but there are	 3.247066817273481
for her own visit there to know the rest	 3.2688062553884243
as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to	 4.315043731808094

it will pass away soon enough	 3.1972393520336104
the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it	 3.437481288057786
as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not	 3.2947890407240465

she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as	 3.6417838032347127
quarrelsome discontented or too poor she sallied forth into the	 3.2615258744090583

this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of	 3.2236624181769304
and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her	 4.018930045002822
proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone	 3.9294600588728925

who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of	 3.7827840040675618
now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and	 4.039280635481555

elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit	 4.662764513729283
the period of expectation was now doubled four weeks were to pass away	 3.5695875564761534
which had at length closed her eyes she could not yet recover from the	 4.313247646141133

extraordinary one after my declaration i do assure you that i am not	 3.9616843139428313
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire	 4.478307886896172

a little seabathing would set me up for ever	 3.4563824290375473
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the	 3.2747469871266657
kindness on a more grateful object	 3.5066458916801007
to talk again of either but there was still something lurking behind	 3.514034390450677
yours c	 2.6128982744868665
own words so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to	 4.398591289508698
to expect him here soon lydia left a few lines for his wife	 3.884501501967413

did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was	 3.6137451124291813
being the mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a	 5.548056512289164
breach but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing	 3.5393754965647135

by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond any thing she	 3.796215632602286
she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till	 4.09527216173483
resume his book but mr collins after assuring them that he bore his	 3.6638149737585373
whether pemberley were not a very fine place what was the name of its	 3.49874850522581

imprudent as to fortune	 3.4910363690970705
yes very different but i think mr darcy improves on acquaintance	 3.9384107774302084
she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see	 3.5747299126945093
thingyoung women should always be properly guarded and attended	 4.95080730538622
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds	 3.653529446498399
as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption	 3.518323045645923
be censured slighted and despised by every one connected with him	 4.211682781853298
my dearest lizzy	 2.9889528149581026

mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during	 3.101855991296809

could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by	 4.219503997618939
acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should	 3.708971646425764
that mr collins should be able to procure any womans good opinion	 3.7300763441332627
from the entrance hall of which mr collins pointed out with a	 3.5801439732254403
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she	 5.231433797720619

have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or	 3.954879682982689

female character	 4.106048510338427
expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present	 4.041743051322265

catherine and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excel	 3.442468277830304
mr darcy replied with great intrepidity	 3.590768667735934
such a study in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined	 4.197217781380227
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months	 4.320767003754328

had yet learnt to care for at a ball they returned therefore in good	 3.070301234968803
splendor and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings	 4.043000799409481
ever	 2.995061774328682
imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often	 3.3708594701410974
he put his letter into her hand she knew not what to think nor how to	 3.2782579219476626
the others with tolerable composure every thing was too recent for	 3.3700574868697712
possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister	 4.299345384440702
said for the present	 3.746576379923679
while you have been here	 4.055544683414152
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment	 3.3319687466171772
another month complete it will be in my power to take one of you as	 3.668541417217406
part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree	 3.6562757506313406
can you come tomorrow	 3.3310963834601277

i honour your circumspection a fortnights acquaintance is certainly	 4.632277019723789
nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement	 3.6975267250279433
elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded	 3.6022770699348037
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me	 4.22484651762327
her husband might then have rested in its proper place	 3.309602690101133
miss bennet do you know who i am i have not been accustomed to such	 4.311540614774234

a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach	 3.7455267421151874
her not objecting does not justify him it only shews her being	 4.595348612434878
i quite forgot i ought not to have said a word about it i promised	 3.5093284985588205
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the	 3.6992437221589674
delightful evening a most excellent ball i wish you had been there	 3.1160552254951104
i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally	 4.094753921688741
rapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection	 3.2533001450608436
affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into	 4.20286197882707
design of engaging my affection it is only that he is blessed with	 3.9705455132360785
charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she	 3.773373869326575
place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been	 3.2220199216023735
with any of them there was no one therefore who could be pointed out	 4.054045498486043
when the door opened and to her very great surprise mr darcy and mr	 3.7706871564549553
bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to	 3.4726946858167023
pursue their first plan and even if he could form such a design	 3.166244463617628
to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation must be	 4.003248496943881
real character it adds even another motive my excellent father	 3.5757984962024474
true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room well colonel	 4.0607371500859415
from pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her	 3.435430057826064
hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news	 3.5051143386722945
such confusion	 3.1236565131814933
it for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone	 4.542322268508176
temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day when	 3.854109609048443

you are very kind sir i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may	 3.092740446869385

to do	 3.6157825395736687
treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner i do not know the	 4.083463521791626
express that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer you	 3.2245884720452693

journey yes i call it a very easy distance	 3.4624412111696303
visitor as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be	 4.327879569088813
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her respect	 3.1819771024464436
passed off much better than she expected for mrs bennet luckily stood	 3.9081720035847716
elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to	 2.6858347088584638

preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right	 4.262710593340967
doubt i suppose of their being really married	 3.772563736641594
a proper direction	 3.9275585097446806
therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his	 3.6730762613013708

made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the	 5.04671948955082
colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send	 3.561417989899758

there can be no doubt of that it is settled between us already that	 3.8273073575161787
did not expect such a compliment	 3.1888767859205895
but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort	 3.639487266204008

though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much	 4.847655082803376
elizabeths arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred	 4.529225073766998
that	 3.346965003203068
behaviour in derbyshire	 3.6406794102870284
placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find	 3.7751237527244514
his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and	 4.01951881707126
went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town but	 3.851202272381851
but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see	 3.5154143770408566

unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her	 3.352177443931379
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what	 4.599040455784858
this would be nothing if you really liked him	 3.3866327970081573
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward as all	 3.649827767541089

to me i should not have been allowed to invite them	 3.625675815945386
diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations	 4.357230590937398
angry but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained	 3.8107393823180775
friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked	 3.9612197851758095
you must acknowledge to be true	 4.011259631492503
informed that she was very accomplished	 4.335221152640735
added that of general unreserve the whole of what elizabeth had already	 4.159517344916033
by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not	 3.530104945029368
when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it and	 3.346979049768218
warm commendation of him narrowly observed them both without supposing	 3.4530498597751054
mrs philipss vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his	 3.6996411281087958
reasonableness she has known him only a fortnight she danced four	 3.3142626054028965
many girls and what sort of young lady is she is she handsome	 3.537223644918376

relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt	 3.7232769641117343
steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and	 3.2101002584730303

aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds	 4.009443643785314
to hint was likely to be very soon engaged	 3.6452552753816305
put me on my guard can there be any other opinion on the subject	 3.829310748756133
that would have tempted me to accept it	 4.137502697337747
off together	 4.375921926526585
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and	 4.478252292106847
mr bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the	 3.486040221018281
my dear brother	 3.4719090552093212
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away unwilling as she	 5.115042148975985
her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such	 4.086708366121971
how can you be so silly cried her mother as to think of such a	 3.698703730572731
waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to	 4.0411455800652885
it he must find it out	 3.6263574831055814
more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the	 3.183134569076456
evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to	 4.351048565958972
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of	 4.01772081077531
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world	 3.80290686966639

attention to the imperfection of the performance when you told mrs	 4.743757507273448

a happier aspect the families who had been in town for the winter came	 4.341085446793729
astonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of mrs	 3.544826680794424

they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought elizabeth	 3.1627236176658493
he readily agreed to it	 3.1418063623395693
her better but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely	 3.0576997311960015
could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her	 3.3836307924562106
you mean to frighten me mr darcy by coming in all this state to hear	 3.9426452208037683
in maria followed and the door was on the point of being closed when	 3.7269652403425444
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she	 4.402783899888871
winter is over	 3.8002563977970967
bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that	 3.711627168370283

before he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london	 3.556570154381394
but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the	 3.4055645786597544

her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the	 3.3810187742154687
the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper	 3.987454555610688
this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in	 4.383699157460407

dishonourable to the stability of her lover she could not prevent its	 3.859587723070539

lovely as ever on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls	 4.303087561768002

about it	 3.244760721516589
elizabeth said to her	 3.411917263000362
almost every day they called at various times of the morning sometimes	 3.387086961189122
esteem and confidence had vanished for ever and all his views of	 5.226203846040129
mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men	 4.03232525869939
that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your	 3.7403523480427285
admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust	 3.3066921918679877
but my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is miss king i	 3.19265130505172
such a risk but against this there were objections and she finally	 3.366674672007152
continue the subject	 3.491396992883576
will not take comfort in mine believe her to be deceived by all means	 3.274170657750402

civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so	 3.434029384045872

would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been	 3.397569208074572

and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself does he	 3.387253341160831
bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he	 4.011741639020435
there is such a sight to be seen i will not tell you what it is make	 3.8884946289778966

to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire	 3.5772137856950232
marked their several meetings in derbyshire and as she threw a	 4.385788426012
husbands incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her	 4.857396058225372
can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment there	 3.9350224420842386
but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so ill of	 3.251800170803512

generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to	 3.7276891345649426
reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at	 3.3740080660712155
i was never more annoyed the insipidity and yet the noise the	 3.8335630547330592
had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance but no	 4.789928216277066
pride and prejudice	 2.5036346075861795

chapter iv	 1.9070367688535859
something and then they soon found out what was the matter	 3.7748665942053603
not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to	 4.014807771486353
loud that any body might have heard us ten miles off	 3.270229953343396
for an answer mrs bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was	 3.6257991146548614
the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not	 3.368166673297297
wickhamyour sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a	 3.3349172783352143
of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her	 4.0462335010657
appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed	 3.3599727913663395
your sister is crossed in love i find i congratulate her next to	 3.7769437480208663
she believed he might have the best informed mind	 3.9061496329578156
attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to	 3.8531456998176266
heard it in silent indignation her heart was divided between concern	 3.6788922918247318
how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its	 3.132942864933909
what they were talking of elizabeth immediately began playing again	 3.366730347894036
an ensign	 2.819713057387654
time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left	 4.301669332977383
the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had	 3.1972693566699153
resentment a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without	 3.9590996459222043
and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her	 3.4492283539859447
him often and after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man	 4.629094016494299
away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of	 3.3603365043202107
maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern	 3.709602621923348
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock	 3.0402486175675345
themselves the one missent must be first attended to it had been	 3.6206623330921692
i should not mind any thing at all	 3.2497375512126627
even mention that gentleman her curiosity however was unexpectedly	 3.296616785667748
yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her	 3.4442782602773323
no one but mrs bennet regretted that their stay would be so short and	 3.797843991680503
mothers permission for this address you can hardly doubt the purport	 3.3126464634225368
found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a	 4.357609182060966
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight	 5.508298224267019
saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting with at least six	 4.933768088153211
but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that	 4.340855179996993
gardiners letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him	 3.5137169210235375
to employ for captivation whatever bears affinity to cunning is	 5.417529560440745
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to	 3.0324525596545864
impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by	 3.089752479056277
whom they sprung poor charlotteit was melancholy to leave her to	 4.796245722872771
received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his	 4.157769201005609
truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble	 3.863568819028233
society she was of course carefully kept and though mrs wickham	 3.8061783347692066
felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some	 4.382760144317087
that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive	 2.9630783339358033
was every reason to believe would be attended to and in the clamorous	 3.5259305665020038
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was	 4.264441984500847
nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable kitty and	 3.675546182896807
closure with this gentlemans proposals which of course you will be	 4.275129664044431
coming towards them and concluding that she came to call them to their	 4.471667738289036
companions all the way to longbourn elizabeth listened as little as she	 3.707164086151848
elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness she had	 4.023926041188075
indeed i have sir was her answer she is a great deal too ill to be	 3.405828813138889
your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline	 3.5998472070680703
information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved	 3.646230498500111
grantleys	 1.962759145445629
of their being in love with each other many weeks	 3.4941746948219037
again by her sister	 3.5163979501537312
mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast the fishing scheme had been	 3.0054898732511033
speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such	 4.5381296179263915
gardiner was so little to be trusted	 3.8145633675732817
reestablish a character we must not make him desperate	 3.479837784324156
chapter xiii	 1.9070367688535859
elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with	 2.967168864365703
be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the	 3.0036074942242568
either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at	 5.154765095071649
understand it if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should	 4.654189426399232
conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the	 3.1873196153980543
laughing myself at your surprise tomorrow morning as soon as i am	 3.181956046151154
may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must deter	 3.9326577005736008
could be done for lydia her uncles interference seemed of the utmost	 3.2224431834711105
than to herself they had long wished to see him the whole party before	 4.066504491781641
them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the	 4.387761606364454
mr bennet made no answer	 2.557463366581507
she will drop the acquaintance entirely	 4.355229677837626
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but	 4.207318667736668
wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities were worn	 4.327837068481137
and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy	 4.760174495084004
elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said	 4.204590893225241
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood	 3.1516518963731084
not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your	 3.9986456854332237
of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate	 4.439681495069137
project gutenbergtm is synonymous with the free distribution of	 4.371019199402112
travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil but that is not the	 3.8543315409838868
for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose it is	 3.8891952368784066
this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure	 4.618124794772128
together can doubt his affection miss bingley i am sure cannot she is	 3.7757523151214865
least not to elizabeths wishes for she was impatient to get home mrs	 4.4636556830948235
can have no great inclination for talking nobody can tell what i	 3.3958288747588377
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly	 3.4682347159938645
much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live	 3.694405314623223
truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the	 3.706453902862491
to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to	 3.2500293953798916
upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is rather an	 2.8252447865075543
each to be dwelt on farther	 5.120308439332855
i must not decide on my own performance	 4.420492435572432
forgotten there was really a great air of comfort throughout and by	 3.4842698366577443
that the interruption must be unwelcome	 3.7774887637620314
outthere is something very pompous in his styleand what can he	 4.023735026741189
look was disputable it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often	 5.220715755342809
expected her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment	 4.361255485610115
the judge they are in the same profession you know only in different	 4.4143302333503485
her against him	 3.6096322493861828
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing	 5.070915058903701
politeness then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute	 3.9427229169537603
words of four syllablesdo not you darcy	 3.6731409931520598
a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to	 3.5887797083790325
enjoyment like reading how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a	 3.788718639166269
to town again therefore stay quietly at longbourn and depend on	 3.7601590894743917
but the gloom of lydias prospect was shortly cleared away for she	 3.5926539438466527
when she was only eight years old	 3.2617679657943985
contrivance breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield	 3.3600086864515193
there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he	 3.1341964103363718
this is an evening of wonders indeed and so darcy did every thing	 3.3565005043362457
lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said	 3.784352857527415
all lost upon me i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably	 3.4591431262138865
you and your family monday november 18th by four oclock and	 4.969371127157801

that is charming three daughters married ten thousand a year oh	 3.038522133781298
other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial	 3.354436857207922

unknown before they could talk of nothing but officers and mr	 3.41921584083389
good enough for him	 3.91218373809814
they could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were	 3.7544926807009076
pleasure mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most	 3.6455557177808284
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently	 3.8060332901089264
first sees my aunt	 3.5481574063684893
income go a good way this is my advice find such a woman as soon as	 3.3832532789214564
of all the views which his garden or which the country or the kingdom	 4.1350925577169715
she could not think of darcys leaving kent without remembering that	 3.6387032841563
children was so highly reprehensible but she had never felt so	 4.202353591724755
voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for	 4.237728792504399
and unvarying society	 3.3647184741038316
both gentlemen as i did before	 3.7820334380784977
whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable	 5.2923688405712435
doings discomposed mr bennet exceedingly in his library he had been	 3.3182925319491976
has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise	 3.4931428015639487

solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no	 3.650766273481357
what he is about he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by	 4.545265131225349
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those	 4.444790157025869
satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingleys quick step	 3.946516390514456
politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place	 3.3489736199805344
to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account i often	 3.6600560714382624
acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head presuming however	 3.2747967484844196
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy jane resolutely	 3.7183353740006684
hertfordshire every body is disgusted with his pride you will not find	 4.680525966537455
myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce	 3.4307297567197725
in a few minutes mrs bennet half opened the door and called out	 3.1010812367723473
is also comprehended she will follow wherever lydia leads vain	 3.49148799625935
forward to as possible at some future time	 3.3674810329782536
this cannot be this must be the grossest falsehoodand when she had	 3.994363648174309
sure it will be too much for kitty wont it kitty	 3.942467720827466
only of you	 3.8071067572175576
wickham he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and	 4.002492437452574
there was no want of discourse the bride and her mother could neither	 5.0063497472048475
much superior solicitude of mr bingleys she could not make a very	 5.148275082052362
tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which	 4.130416070980878
determine what to say in reply you wanted me i know to say yes	 3.6245158309487717
settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity	 3.231046703063508
walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word	 3.174954879292212
that will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at	 3.8086375730063984
electronic works	 3.40560777792565
the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good	 4.062776700674563
her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her	 4.289363564645185
mrs bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of they	 4.199417809854966
can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this this young	 3.418875450558444
till its success could be known likewise for though feeling almost	 3.1935517975732317
provoked her	 2.596722122633877
answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring	 3.883020605529144
you did and it was not wholly without foundation you may remember	 3.8793770772844303
that she could not leave her bingley urged mr joness being sent for	 3.8983586276076263

to understand it could not be for society as he frequently sat there	 3.4505163739419977
elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by	 3.475009700134717
prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain	 4.3510337198208635
known sir williams too long he could tell her nothing new of the	 3.3447918435684776
take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the	 3.8316195012883623
hearing from caroline she accounted for it however by supposing that	 3.928202612191408
together	 3.753565353305436
how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her	 3.5831730850913224

no i should have turned in a moment	 3.872157994014465
met elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an	 3.680626836494249
such as creation of derivative works reports performances and	 5.3766287011939005
this was a sad omen of what her mothers behaviour to the gentleman	 3.6867643738744684
as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage	 3.321962055224499
called during her absence mr darcy only for a few minutes to take	 3.4539978704113827
cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the	 5.101601268201798
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself	 3.2345623831101875
i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy	 4.0039764719106845
paragraph 1c below there are a lot of things you can do with project	 4.334397248154138
supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough	 4.701038803679735
i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly	 3.688363129780349
about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready	 5.03944928912672
vain and nonsensical as i knew i had oh how i wanted you	 4.134898482201308
regiment	 3.9436992346424455
collins then returned to elizabeth	 3.4498030563187956
that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot	 4.153150329028766
but elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already	 4.594416319614538
he then went away and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of	 3.8589747070539495
but it will have no effect on me	 3.3303418635756996
court	 1.962759145445629

proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs	 3.488876271491182
a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would	 4.2702516867383205
mrs bennet give up the point she talked to elizabeth again and again	 3.2785979260824742
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity to have	 4.443058215609229
do not you want to know who has taken it cried his wife impatiently	 3.318381428479232
concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a	 3.8323341536202844
you till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your	 4.0285054555632565
as they concerned george wickham what a stroke was this for poor jane	 3.4582994082314027
you must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon mature	 3.4694463061830927
catherines carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter	 4.542132747014314
error i have certainly meant well through the whole affair my object	 3.2686726683500407
of perfect civility	 3.8179293718343117
one sleepless night out of two	 3.214118395849902
why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that	 4.542615125730788
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection mr collins	 3.7521426783050296
catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding	 3.032872621998377
sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane	 3.5271179283319145
gentlemens appearing her colour increased yet she received them with	 3.6011885355716426
london in a respectable line of trade	 3.676892885034742
us as soon as you returned i have not forgot you see and i assure	 4.551791286749987
varied however her determination never did	 3.495272575852898
of pleasure was lost in shame she felt anew the justice of mr darcys	 4.126988434398545
was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it	 2.990142736395274
bingleyand pray what is the result	 3.597727267594488
were by themselves how strange this is and for this we are to be	 3.2355395726814113
him before mr whats his name that tall proud man	 3.5029583826687114
she had purposely thrown herself in his way again oh why did she come	 3.5360378462113102
things that you can do with most project gutenbergtm electronic works	 3.2171468155456346
brought the following note for elizabeth	 3.2644436962561216
it is well you refuse then to oblige me you refuse to obey the	 4.0179648619146215
emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world	 4.126947457677627
as i might have done but the horror of what might possibly happen	 4.310721964119245
less his son might have borne with me better but his fathers uncommon	 3.9258317479100815
to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming	 5.304930810316852
with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at	 4.12406340117791
weight i may suffer from the want of money younger sons cannot marry	 3.2654208257765807
money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared	 3.678576910088997
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish	 4.218580138446651
he was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence	 3.56937756811646
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man i would	 4.776305484246939
bingley had now been gone a week and nothing was heard of his return	 3.47798319070871
she was still dear to him perhaps he had been civil only because he	 3.3366978435518457
things though the words are often used synonimously a person may be	 3.3284399445471236
therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that	 3.876424175671177
was not unwelcome for its own sake the journey would moreover give her	 3.442650172606413
were the principal inhabitants they found mr bennet still up with a	 3.350948234882546
disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her	 3.293949787717811
amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you	 4.925397304757557
called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was	 3.4864236203093797
and her husband at longbourn as soon as they were married that he was	 3.227629974575079
performing copying or distributing any project gutenbergtm works	 3.2911304348535237
knowledge she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor any thing	 3.541769509631896
very proudas a child she was affectionate and pleasing and	 3.135249725520048
subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went	 3.8030787050185
and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice oh lydia	 3.7576960347378083
not rest till i knew the particulars let me thank you again and again	 2.907892107868254
evening after tea mr bennet retired to the library as was his	 3.9082514607641863
one owns a united states copyright in these works so the foundation	 3.125991788093077
end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way mr	 4.2249715928938185
makeattention forbearance patience with darcy was injury to	 4.437879314223773
longbourn before she told her sister of mr darcys proposals to know	 3.7793156779421655
if you are not so compassionate as to dine today with louisa and	 4.080933007596862
how really happy he was	 3.4337128848742644
i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and tell the	 3.915051173423028
it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen i was	 4.676020313607153
and taking her hand he would have given it to mr darcy who though	 4.358483624422493
referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam	 3.649348926322335
can all plague and punish one another teaze himlaugh at	 5.665253007055492
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to	 3.497764392783841
even to charlottes wishes to be the case and after various	 4.082225440691654
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for	 4.02901707473266
for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it	 3.0236522365288367
address most truly the gentleman mr darcy looked just as he had been	 3.8108930086756563
which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room and	 3.730740838225107
wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of	 3.525420766151506
down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much	 3.9587516867697206
done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlottes	 4.451209958511231
on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by	 4.330474052169176
the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined	 3.306284063520587
and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it	 3.887809346453288
him too little to care for his approbation	 3.7275121793756396
mr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted	 3.07154026437079
and by that means as i told lady catherine myself one day has deprived	 3.289507781219647
already arisen repeated mr bennet what has she frightened away	 3.538780448139918
he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring i had not	 3.866391974498999
turned silently away mrs bennet who fancied she had gained a complete	 4.257909772362372
is nothing he would not do for her	 3.840836209316673
almost every day she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had	 4.393336791962033
business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world for	 3.7830949740697215
particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him	 3.8208374193971726
acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an	 4.66020272447797
imprudent as a marriage between mr wickham and our poor lydia	 3.4839318323277557
yesbut he seemed to like his second better	 3.447722922722196
go the next day for a short time	 3.893020892908808
character perfectly well here consequently was an inexhaustible subject	 3.3341692996516197
added kitty	 3.6501849139648
as likely to give any news of him and in the wretched state of his own	 4.827325358175085
almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond	 4.345205140332267
the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her	 3.7777926054870483
disagreeable	 3.015813500735299
shall keep mine to swell my song	 3.5761723395177123
softened by his manner of expressing himself	 2.988562790717433
himselffrom whom she had previously received the information of his	 3.966459200577092
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer	 4.368160236418743
come darcy said he i must have you dance i hate to see you	 4.373063476694703
different walks i think she will be pleased with the hermitage	 3.891623271192148
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up	 4.429199019898483
and every body began to find out that they had always distrusted the	 4.0852619913933355
between distress and diversion mrs bennet and kitty walked off and as	 3.9590502126356046
elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him	 3.6957265167485773
on one side of your lawn i should be glad to take a turn in it if you	 4.298764927249736
they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me	 3.4215943658176196
considered therefore as finally settled and rising as she thus	 4.377868102327189
officers at once	 3.774957125404043
your lady and daughters your wellwisher and friend	 3.939005231742657
affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive	 4.1294338262408115
for there was much to be discussed wickham of course wanted more	 4.065270039180341
with only one there is but such a quantity of merit between them just	 4.633382113275727
of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished	 4.051761767692275
reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last	 3.4578259040966586
and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to	 3.3753796046107367
several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the	 4.39088064164156
you on an affair of importance i understand that mr collins has made	 3.5457262603395012
true said mr bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of	 4.372723900916949
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in she had fully proposed being	 3.3851355802384315
concerning either detection could not be in your power and	 4.070211709996981
including obsolete old middleaged and new computers it exists	 3.2675254834253664
i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham i can	 3.794248815550706
no interval of ease or forgetfulness	 3.6814821247679976
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience	 3.3499494666787233
rained hard her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was	 4.738222930966449
determined he should know it and so i let down the side glass next to	 3.525203390494063
had reserved for them but jane was to go home with her and at	 4.20954114862009
the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her	 3.1967186414683293
for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure	 3.4443156700753863
posterity with all the eclat of a proverb	 3.37196224177445
situation hastily exclaimed i beg your pardon but i must leave you	 4.108665093891204
hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered	 4.329191730613264

disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last	 4.832365552454712
him better when they met in kent than before and that she had never	 3.8047539194788804
and it was done for the beston this subject i have nothing more	 4.529850913841434
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or	 3.2859886093229935
ready to believe for every bodys sake that she may feel something	 3.2983445918657006

room	 3.812039499756199
not the slightest i can remember no symptom of affection on either	 4.491845610664365
aye no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had	 4.088913567824349
yesthe late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best	 5.913612086049594
every thing seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him	 3.7710802421965064

letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be	 3.4395023562473854
and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one card	 3.8486842237318193
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of	 3.4812633232346277

with anyone for forty years he produced and distributed project	 3.706310139774485

make after all their hertfordshire friends elizabeth construing all	 3.362988116363345
she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it	 3.8158734413743036
room when last at pemberley	 3.489422527784095
more unequal than she had often seen them	 3.374584854120249
me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i	 4.409684762045093
wickham what a good joke it will be i can hardly write for	 4.282631876732805
i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed cried	 3.2131360933074418
exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephews letter that	 4.397339941554639
mrs bennet rang the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to the	 4.403200024708174
meryton and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that	 3.5714072046065115
thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears	 3.3394411825081383
after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr wickham	 3.5638546372146815
she did indeed louisa i could hardly keep my countenance very	 3.3968189599033662
as affable to the poor	 4.843035732795818
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she	 3.1148077860740866
and we mean to treat you all added lydia but you must lend us the	 4.484860518223653

to dine at rosings the next day	 3.731794277627407
thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you	 3.779826221732562
much but he saw only the father the ladies were somewhat more	 3.1955385548435378
at least he has not deceived us haggerston has our directions and	 3.4485490294437824
certain absolutely certain	 3.704598481624057
no indeed i felt nothing but surprise	 3.07419434455528
long speeches of mr collins who was complimenting mr bingley and his	 4.761152442261039
collection are in the public domain in the united states if an	 3.367631173109901
miss bennet there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness	 3.8696515516871557
on the very last day of the regiments remaining in meryton he dined	 4.88740961616679
language as this i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world	 3.288488240065147
fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished since her	 3.846453118467502
there are very few people of whom so much can be said you are lucky in	 3.6807891778541637
circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i	 5.393953909005233
whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if i	 3.508221674544679
was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied	 4.294513956942577
will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write againat	 3.340881886364008

unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimed	 3.4423785784014567
the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be	 3.4078665315376306
of discourse in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the	 5.071338914067402
way i shall offer to pay him tomorrow he will rant and storm about	 4.804946949063354
they should have opposed their brothers what sister would think	 3.528821255008371
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the	 3.2420197004582696
her purchases look here i have bought this bonnet i do not think it	 3.995639173770766
admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard	 3.88899822674377
engrossed by mr darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for mr	 3.671338585633146
while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart	 3.3279918054540008
said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long	 4.817584882045684
if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the	 3.258838085419308

darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from	 4.573000701111145
understanding darcy was the superior bingley was by no means deficient	 3.2009596923551196
and truth in a few short sentences	 4.099386364858682

i will not be interrupted hear me in silence my daughter and my	 3.4787529137979134
the effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw	 4.375156352196026
perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very	 3.8799698199667523

but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her	 3.7578127179020653
for them the motive professed was his conviction of its being	 3.389508375052836
were it certain that lady catherine would think so said mr collins	 3.535295513008472
however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor	 3.9045337145549204
sake of what had been rather than what was charlottes first letters	 3.706634498545228
shall we ask your cousin the reason of this said elizabeth still	 3.3498248488586784
every body was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment	 3.5429949539995773

provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions	 4.104996677645787
perhaps that is not possible for any one but it has been the study of	 3.931708192292447

his defection much more to heart than i do they are young in the ways	 3.413053098264984
about	 3.3154980750805785
but when mrs philips began to express her concern thereupon he assured	 3.0938125908343475
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design these	 3.2850002703041934

he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin	 3.315478143416493
miss bennets astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly	 3.945108040991898
as false and deceitful as he is insinuating	 4.44861599499714
of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i	 3.096205901434676

from your daughters lips instead of your own but we are all liable to	 4.100580171515652

corps not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcys meditated	 3.438498542167364
excuse my interferenceit was kindly meant	 4.647641188243536
the praise on her sisters warm affection	 3.804441952767903
seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choicea sacrifice to	 3.7541402015909067
that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet	 3.46567957020756
most people start at our web site which has the main pg search facility	 4.6635863363070085
did mr darcy give you his reasons for this interference	 4.006616073504483
have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity	 4.001263953444594
he is the best landlord and the best master said she that ever	 4.32122443857323

be under the greatest obligations to my fathers active superintendance	 4.025513345969411
and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs bennets	 4.417806634636493
illwill for being justified in your advice to me last may which	 3.5426244908297564
whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably	 3.4217262135299933
believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such	 4.110617358584651
replied that he was adding but we expect him tomorrow with a	 4.525047844191503
and noble names	 2.585898816171302
and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr bennet were dead she	 4.195589756574684
of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children	 4.49014484611261
bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way	 3.511259185270572
collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed	 3.8607148129648747
signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however	 3.299650595416492
were not decidedly better bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters	 4.01691067322198
in confirming or crushing it steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke	 5.116033148447174
oh my dear brother replied mrs bennet that is exactly what i	 2.8579825144831537
with an air of decided fashion his brotherinlaw mr hurst merely	 4.161020551551009
either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object it	 3.286996169474672
completely in your wayand if the second i can admire you much better	 3.414866058523944
delighted with him he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely	 3.3018595987912254
indeed mr collins all praise of me will be unnecessary you must	 3.6616789749902128
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always	 3.863117526598469
for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle and you saw the	 4.100897544378509
solicitude they shewed for jane the apothecary came and having	 3.8018784994518033
colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality	 3.9369406859411566
and wish him all manner of evil but my feelings are not only cordial	 3.347635571183538
enjoyment was certainthat of suitableness as companions a	 4.712322349290352
at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few	 3.8587910851675535
for my own part she rejoined i must confess that i never could see	 3.739952285724842
party mr bingley had danced with her twice and she had been	 4.359911071453229
boast and so fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to	 4.173206506024741
she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might	 3.1667847609291053
your equipment	 2.865476597519818
earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of	 3.5505647070076005
jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to	 4.042451882454853
i know not miss elizabeth said he whether mrs collins has yet	 3.3894685225988184
her voice was weak and her manner affectedelizabeth was in agonies	 4.986349987481149
our dear bingley what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always	 3.83566665011005
must be stated though brieflythe situation of your mothers	 3.969263319298112

mrs bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some	 3.400769192077776
a ball was at any rate a ball and even mary could assure her family	 3.7237693727346697
an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her	 3.5068527020427998
thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think	 5.8012507018552935
scheme of infamy my poor father how he must have felt it	 4.272999030706682
you comply with all other terms of this agreement for free	 3.440491788534476
it is wholly out of my power you must feel it and the usual	 3.3981466665191666
no i thank you she replied endeavouring to recover herself there	 4.238737715445809
up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks	 4.263436334388021
you will feel the effects of it no officer is ever to enter my house	 4.7126140862082595
her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock chatsworth	 4.016068436562064
oh mr bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar	 3.559869539089845
at rosings a comparison that did not at first convey much	 3.6461223784334766
their corps this was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted	 3.938698417594559
bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out	 3.52112491945952
repeat his persuasion of their not marryingand from that i am	 4.7622878743859935
is nothing the matter with me i am quite well i am only distressed by	 3.7235344242935673
having such a master	 3.690019326448207
foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day	 3.8625540398165956
strong already but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i	 3.6275693324178664
not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering	 3.257766649089676
catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which	 4.626620304126698
our present arrangements and to request that he will satisfy the	 4.510276435641479
and men take care that they should	 3.7445476152622845
my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts let us hope for	 2.9837901010617793
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane but she would not	 4.492043757925604

all gone to bed from colonel forster to inform us that she was	 4.335198550535185
the family	 3.3688244892648
with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel	 5.10697501057492
ignorant and less insipid from the farther disadvantage of lydias	 4.368684020267445
ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise but no	 3.8512658500414627
elizabeth and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment for she had	 2.9484037625128665
mothers rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated	 5.279271259694458
indeed mr bennet said she it is very hard to think that charlotte	 3.4198350768893135
philosophic composure he said as little as he had ever been in the	 4.10893901348872
for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it	 3.865371533267221
their visits to mrs philips were now productive of the most interesting	 4.871445236143393
victory over him continued her triumph	 3.4024347619205875
feelingly a younger son you know must be inured to selfdenial and	 4.0241797264493115
neighbourhood except netherfield he is not at all liked in	 3.7570128243717877
she made no answer	 3.0891883421828865
she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited	 4.364099430224161
be though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte	 3.4732471105621205
had left her four thousand pounds	 3.30157226709092
mrs bennet and mrs philips was an amiable intelligent elegant	 3.508234878087306
quite through in a very close handthe envelope itself was likewise	 4.774649677182301
from any one but myself he is gone to my father already oh lizzy to	 3.5537731601139932
you look conscious young ladies have great penetration in such matters	 3.825080995175607
unreasonable my brother admires her greatly already he will have	 3.248558133004013
and have you answered the letter said elizabeth	 3.0538851430766827
before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part	 3.225776587329323
tranquillity	 1.962759145445629
you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and	 3.217278520161103
things said than i am going to say but he is an ugly fellow i am glad	 4.589277722890689
the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after	 3.1489537195758586
comes alone because we shall see the less of him not that i am afraid	 4.02174443135504
the town but his debts of honour were still more formidable mr	 4.536526128892673
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed he was received by mrs	 3.780356167504946
jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy mr bingley was	 4.478868029396375
when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone now was the	 3.5049105172613513
first to listen and to pity the first to be admired and in his manner	 4.018020709619492
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them	 4.303755746039005
the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux	 4.084618856610793
if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your	 3.4561916627953257
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the	 5.293614771138851
her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her	 4.139740356565111
a most country town indifference to decorum	 3.1012930755332158
compared with some families i believe we were but such of us as	 3.806970695980643
termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its	 4.216873594355699
he would not have danced half so much for gods sake say no more of	 3.8072476099925363
part of each was when the post was expected the arrival of letters was	 3.9593310014254754
mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he	 3.1432993990958233
resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it	 3.7606914599938266
i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment	 3.1387665645670864

their other neighbours and to hear herself called mrs wickham by	 3.308287759054808
on his cousin allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with	 4.027709409129766
private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before	 3.5896334707062394
pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her	 3.6972182440675647
together there is no end of it well i was so frightened i did not	 4.265144402950379

fathers death her home has been london where a lady lives with her	 3.2422879231749038
as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she	 3.643675549232
occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself	 3.8113779252495736
it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he	 4.366836860661941
their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could	 4.5095156603871835
assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to	 4.704298737684561
the project gutenberg literary archive foundation	 2.2733313517539
there is not much the matter with me	 3.3472073654252177
anxiety on janes behalf was another prevailing concern and mr	 3.567839232184038
oh your father of course may spare you if your mother candaughters	 3.7272046550382782
astonishand perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly	 3.612016031183424
what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself the	 3.195424003206968
had a very different story to hear	 3.885626140906124
that the chimneypiece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all	 4.94706940470899
i understood that there were some very strong objections against the	 2.794709150892681
of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as	 4.225546354648627
it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it	 3.872568217995216
yes thought elizabeth that would be a delightful scheme indeed	 3.4539634907482952
uncle would most readily have settled the whole they battled it	 3.4610776588325507
till elizabeth entered the drawingroom at netherfield and looked in	 3.478044471600728
that led to the copse elizabeth was determined to make no effort for	 5.095539528577018
mrs collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria and	 3.895569490314018
all compassion in anger she tried however to compose herself to	 3.4163686076592863
to others as in his reproaches to myself after this period every	 4.489970345130043
accents	 1.962759145445629
could have the advantage of a london master she has a very good notion	 3.545858988901994

i take no leave of you miss bennet i send no compliments to your	 3.4684566546912166
amongst the most violent against him was mrs bennet whose dislike of	 3.54852271846597
married you know at st clements because wickhams lodgings were in	 4.221623961261619
mrs gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in	 3.333389575166615
but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by not	 2.8047026149195062
application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited	 3.5146311010282143
expect a renewal of his love is there one among the sex who would not	 4.945074370226607
not err but when she read and reread with the closest attention the	 4.496155705035542
miss bennet still looked all amazement elizabeth again and more	 3.2952133879232144
spirits there were periods of dejection it was reasonable however to	 5.136479608861395

was forced to come by herself and then what do you think we did we	 3.345810209343017
their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and	 3.558122257548005
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and	 3.5622695573197762
wishes to avoid seeing me he must go we are not on friendly terms	 3.636602791478257
mr darcy you see is the man now lizzy i think i have	 3.280356249453369
all that embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the	 4.123291383796082
score	 1.962759145445629
had elizabeths opinion been all drawn from her own family she could	 4.041338932440442
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper written	 4.694515313087791
the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no	 3.7285862196271267
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a	 4.763563163006009
hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the	 3.4472532589150147

began another marys powers were by no means fitted for such a display	 3.887607615811249
better worth looking at in the summer	 3.218064725037562

lydia declared herself satisfied oh yesit would be much better to	 3.714157246290888
offending your patroness	 3.117218698348362
disconcerted she could not imagine what business he could have in town	 3.5513622189390723
janei certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her	 3.3461286965774293
i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all	 3.539158444477734
and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i	 4.442319961352968
from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an	 3.68530035647707

my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to was a question	 3.3387258532505033
my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your	 3.844918948083924
domestic happiness were overthrown but mr bennet was not of a	 3.51845440515558
i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women	 3.3247384119622416
any body as he has done by poor wickham he has not an illnatured	 3.623529094672735
that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed	 3.5946324861950454

gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of	 4.716621052646857
i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william	 3.234358416513651
he is as fine a fellow said mr bennet as soon as they were out of	 3.584330363549422
kitty for hill i will put on my things in a moment my dear dear	 3.92564309374484

you already use to calculate your applicable taxes the fee is	 4.815257036603315
as we went along kitty and me drew up all the blinds and pretended	 3.3309548647011558
but three miles from them were the first points of selfgratulation	 3.6448175761841095
his parishioners whenever it were required	 3.2316061316649582
in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow	 3.9626238398399654
may i ask but checking himself he added in a gayer tone is it in	 3.3684693481126358
it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon	 3.482379149203644
well lizzy said mrs bennet one day what is your opinion now of	 3.756360549674917
of temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave	 3.3056995665693156
again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to	 3.887306378485972
amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds	 3.3786272950141902
going to the butchers she told me on purpose to order in some meat on	 5.099886496118573
it must have been his sisters doing they were certainly no friends to	 3.1431909391522908

afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room colonel fitzwilliam	 3.499055767764477
being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud	 4.179925345515777

very thankful for his compliance but could not wait for his reason	 3.995218140827944
person of ranksuch affability and condescension as he had himself	 5.14516471308484
the least and who she observed to mrs collins was a very genteel	 3.6375890132939204
we will be down as soon as we can said jane but i dare say kitty is	 3.947480485666303
you are rather disposed to call his interference officious	 2.9507406099927955
illtreatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite	 3.735682592412394
we never should have got into the coach i was ready to die of laughter	 4.502352207820806
for charlottes sake she made more favourable than it really was but	 3.114401819945278

however at her having any such fears now because if he had at	 3.7930601611720567
they were dances of mortification mr collins awkward and solemn	 4.481948646739267

after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject mr	 3.9012889304124294
from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two	 3.9954573365599604
restrain her astonishment from being visible never even in the company	 3.230615638507879
him except just now and then so do not put yourself to	 3.339862701815884
once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own till the next	 3.7487681973898357

not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercisea	 3.102451465893901
her hopes as her fears and after talking with her in this manner till	 4.868057971293207
was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said thanking her	 3.62404681357292
society i own is necessary to me i have been a disappointed man and	 3.7923468282373918
your ladyship has declared it to be impossible	 3.2846534699598156

while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the	 3.513326049328185
it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession	 3.1574776161596345

perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page she	 3.586548721758027
her charge mr wickhams chief object was unquestionably my	 3.3321114869526007
conviction as truly as i wished it in reasonmy objections to	 3.9585785981563295
manner	 3.3223111468481097
i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied	 3.331581687547754
extraordinary for on first hearing it mrs bennet sat quite still and	 3.14663247819263
wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what	 4.251059433941333
united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a	 3.670240899744634
family without being alarmed on the score of the gentlemans conduct	 4.65386819465327

in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion	 4.006721751221162
with astonishment and disdain i wonder you took the trouble of coming	 4.0666315863704945
i had no more idea of being married till i came back again though i	 3.426810592857108
his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many	 4.35622689554541
refinements of polished societies	 2.4234045154038326
forbid it can i speak plainer do not consider me now as an elegant	 3.585385693608973
confidence subsisted between mr darcy and herself	 3.7112624044976195
you will be attended to	 3.664729648142826
education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend	 3.8128024137290755
tell me once for all are you engaged to him	 3.216737827569609
elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate	 3.664945574523455

very bad it is almost past belief and poor mr darcy dear lizzy only	 3.0868417377734407
manhe is a great friend of darcys	 3.540059571354264
she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was	 4.261845340279841

idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him but i	 4.642002285171546
elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was	 3.519149762604181
daughters favour without having paid yourself and mr bennet the	 3.5410584753832413
my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in	 4.444711596041821
of a fine stout healthy love it may every thing nourishes what is	 3.829152228659445
kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours	 4.20524604061739
oh yes you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i	 3.410870280969635
start of the project gutenberg ebook pride and prejudice	 2.231010168640262
when i am in town it is pretty much the same they have each their	 2.9976231406394174
she grew absolutely ashamed of herselfof neither darcy nor wickham	 2.944295064441414
you began the evening well charlotte said mrs bennet with civil	 3.79753140344795
answering immediately to the last questionoh the eldest miss bennet	 3.478161186920417
but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any	 3.96191099363782
reason but your arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation	 5.003637997284165
feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she	 3.878247143484128
nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself as to	 3.4478733440993636
with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike	 3.64957151729656
the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the	 3.5699089172226657
how i long to see her again i never met with anybody who delighted me	 3.0035700310624645
what is it you mean	 3.190721953868485
their attachment but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot	 4.431078684422915
but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult	 3.262193546308743
elizabeths spirits were so high on the occasion that though she did	 3.465196873523046
ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship	 4.060885416857925
search of the parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in view	 3.164357014005283
the carriage was not to be had and as she was no horsewoman walking	 4.1530160087713766
engaged to my daughter now what have you to say	 3.371656618227862
courteous	 1.962759145445629
different was the effect of a second perusalhow could she deny that	 4.057281873403655
remarked he meant to make enquiries at clapham if he could any how	 3.8229557227621056
and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making	 4.722106948142754
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added how long did you	 2.924143224617491
as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without losing a	 4.331894054705027
pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of	 4.450319388738618
the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made	 3.2243970238179607
and is this all cried elizabeth i expected at least that the pigs	 3.3554414387778375
elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her very little	 4.098894733473218
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility mr darcy looked	 3.698752581320016
to continue the london road i know not what to think after making	 3.5095190202474282
interest all her tender feelings and nothing therefore remained to be	 3.3767009055403245
no want of subjectwe may compare our different opinions	 3.686558766569587
we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure	 3.728217211631012
glancing over it said in a colder voice	 3.4423812015246975
soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet it came	 4.509575554800939
her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on	 4.613278063462997
habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five	 3.68129808964046
enjoyments to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as	 3.547921985706965
neighbour in her	 2.859827978493073
enough from my thoughts	 3.67336783599831

originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome	 3.872230727640741
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingleys dislike of her had	 3.583886181292464
likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken	 4.016664181222134
suspicion certainly not in your inclination you may possibly	 3.3987721435380447
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers but	 4.412889581900772
than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable	 4.618300715440021
that kind may befal you you have an affectionate mother who will always	 3.831761570420236
father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they	 3.5146259663613293

as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the	 5.870084000294579
had a great deal of talk together they met again on sunday and	 3.405642000924847
but it had not been so in derbyshire there he had talked to her	 3.3335412454188185
venture near her lest she might hear too much when they sat down to	 3.4793553287178387
but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be	 3.571772758452662
it was a fortnight since mrs bennet had been down stairs but on this	 3.3911796781383288
sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of	 3.5319362961763656
being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him	 3.239520361814484
them indeed excited a lively attention the suspicions which had just	 4.025522165706599
speak she in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydias	 3.72856884312336
him it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we	 4.117302782478178
and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the	 3.4696588343093815
what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters let me take it	 3.2846470162878045
little of ones neighbours assistance is impossible condolence	 3.3120132177108808
derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no	 3.806346947787213
i will make no promise of the kind	 3.033302753438799
it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be	 3.8773493618091623
think than such as did not	 3.502793084023856
them round the table	 3.5612140618611003
darcy called and was shut up with him several hours it was all	 4.22434465908891
connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy	 3.4080380559304326
on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than	 3.611840242608858
them as nonsense i cannot quite agree with you there what say you	 3.6695942817033895
would happen but who could have foreseen such an attention as this who	 4.127459336739114
to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last	 4.539175580043885
was exactly what darcy had hoped to see they were able to love each	 3.3933887222598305
the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger mrs	 3.5460884249386777
my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong	 3.7704432698346797
quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any	 4.543531874403287
perhaps i am not doing her justice but she is very young she has never	 3.9417539272234525
between them and if she might judge from his complexion his mind was	 4.432663270218402
have somebody who thinks of those things where shall you change	 3.608193688044783
long from my poor mother i am afraid you will not be able to make	 3.873504296914506
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a	 4.097452265877951
collected in one individual nor was darcys vindication though	 3.6196517793068734
heavy looking young man of five and twenty his air was grave and	 3.6237118838193907
she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy she turned her eyes on the	 3.96179016300864
next morning to her mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for	 3.2155979410326703
because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement	 3.8545683776923747
oh cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted but it is so	 4.2600021282194
could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydias note to his	 3.5365388971702347
elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath	 3.853736300144279
fruits of her own heinous offence	 2.9984545868637364
of them but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be	 4.591909433641079
she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which	 4.006501537282144
elizabeth tried to join in her fathers pleasantry but could only force	 3.3931047277293787
to mrs gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure	 3.8340388191010515
i wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is	 3.5573010298761343
inflicted	 1.962759145445629
door bell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its	 4.790517304520109
be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of	 4.106930318169636
after they are married and above all things keep mr bennet from	 3.413849802224591
by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at	 4.332267999406139
here again i shall give you painto what degree you only can tell	 3.368814792396684
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project	 3.578501930497319
uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the	 3.74180294600189
smiles for you are wasting your time with me	 4.0795891467381695
not well enoughyou cannot go yourself	 3.5554183979155045
yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension	 3.2384718312505574
man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their	 3.664766094931125
happiness jane had been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own	 4.480912243498727
immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of	 4.584303613070278
pitied	 1.962759145445629
proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for	 3.378255119778149
have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject	 3.5033777721043635
was impossible not to try for information mr darcy had been at her	 3.6741870763827276
instead her liveliness had been never worse timed there was no help	 4.538411045485856
miserly father and though he belonged to one of the universities he	 4.329335160882016
too much truth the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no	 3.1872143708596536
sister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could	 4.48145099372906
it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire any thing beyond	 3.5330699821298515
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and	 3.7462752359872074
presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone while	 4.307353830247293
necessary i hope you have destroyed the letter there was one part	 4.748547557923427
friend you see by janes account was persuaded of his never intending	 3.265290208335083

let mr collins and me have a little conversation together	 4.2617342304175105
when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i	 3.5353566043054725
and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been	 3.547816544179893
oh mary said she i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun	 3.608480256669442
eldest daughter she must just mentionshe felt it incumbent on her	 3.6423298192446585
if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which	 3.7822631862411518
was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no	 4.45607929289329
wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him but though	 4.905149593036523
such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not	 3.9165927122553703
wanted in the farm mr bennet are not they	 4.936485187124031
thank you again and again for not going to the lakes how could i	 3.6414844218924687

mother could be though in a quieter way elizabeth felt janes	 3.9032293735248755
son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a well known	 4.626807591030437
no my dear i think not i have great hopes of finding him quite the	 3.3223827116450315
she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to	 3.6640226946565786
was not in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it in	 4.092153707673014
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a few	 3.6120633369336552
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject day after	 3.485377991017739
could not be seen and mr darcy found on further enquiry that	 4.186015616622876
catherines condescension as he knew not how to admire enough	 3.8535079752821306
mr wickhams society was of material service in dispelling the gloom	 4.246876609724673
probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak	 4.536130508977331
increasing	 4.262920389358727
constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great	 3.764848444000836
engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the	 3.932694042850808
kitty had not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we	 5.574346405058355
animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and	 2.9176754719419526
goand at another word might stay a month	 3.1131013815282635
table for him	 3.799246533499954
the pianoforte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead	 3.8283285330308727
then taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy she left elizabeth to walk	 4.119264080539713
heart did whisper that he had done it for her but it was a hope	 4.802562027784599
horsesoh bromley of courseif you mention my name at the bell	 3.7850046388954572
better that one only of the household and the one whom they could	 4.665745699221414
grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery	 5.038116571888537
indifference and brevity and the other said no more	 4.059141967630213
elizabeth asked questions in vain maria would tell her nothing more	 3.192373889307144
honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on	 3.5758022587546514
instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for	 5.075690565380227
morning to answering it as i foresee that a little writing will	 4.866098818533244
father though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was really	 4.091607083792907
elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books	 3.007677481333165
would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the	 3.6075648461875813
near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced	 4.140734116311743
and this said she is the end of all his friends anxious	 3.9140299918410006
cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement when hearing	 4.388878907740852
the world	 3.4105765267728327
every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the	 3.8820451459037115
military library whitehall	 2.765433442787302
interest but nothing to justify enquiry	 3.8920762475517883
openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be	 3.5462983908286922
good lord sir william how can you tell such a storydo not you know	 4.289624260916091
mr collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed	 4.571138695863787
to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse	 4.256429318676503
disapprobation	 1.962759145445629
suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly to	 3.395423179634813
she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley	 3.9087548502340996
give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london	 3.766510173078428
who do you mean my dear i know of nobody that is coming i am sure	 3.7372369885440015
lines as for your elizabeths picture you must not attempt to have it	 3.789690728522317
keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition	 4.732220179929313
soon as she could to the girls who could not listen to their cousin	 4.344848633492374
before not many hours after the express though lydias short	 3.2538834013992224
not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever	 3.6909228247283004
oh papa what news what news have you heard from my uncle	 3.1760200344461347
body for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all	 3.445319848602545
elizabeths mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after	 4.778610396001526
saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother	 3.85213269626902
respects there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for	 4.722645735032716
i nor any body can ever forget it is useless to talk of it	 3.8196464281941855
she can have her own waybut i tell you what miss lizzy if you take	 3.7545128533880425
intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled i have been a	 3.658848990623016
her cried in a half whisper i am glad you are come for there is such	 3.532414058219791
depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them	 3.8119757860263923
here i am determined we must have mrs long and the gouldings soon	 4.389983764850153
her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the	 4.218363212320856
i am now convinced	 3.409024544137495
that is not very likely our authority was too good	 3.438262084377436
the youngest i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next	 3.452790152578116
send but even of that they would have been glad to be certain mr	 4.09939022377369
when mr bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual	 3.661196198850222
of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the	 3.812690141810798
conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and	 3.807991197575406
where they like	 3.452989741791194
door jane was at a drawingroom window watching their arrival when	 3.508893813657951
but jane could think with certainty on only one pointthat mr	 3.9438181081690953
his partners oh that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance	 4.708820351565181
yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word	 3.1444053217473455
character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had	 3.1439234354213608
less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done	 3.8650662649008236
carter do not go so often to miss watsons as they did when they first	 3.7479667225347897
continued her mother but at the same time mr bingley it is very	 3.9964685745504296
not perhaps of neglecting his own interest but of every other neglect	 3.853795592033897
if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often	 3.9418238715315232
the scheme it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at	 4.042424143624391
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its	 3.684826995145033
one should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brotherinlaw and	 5.051988552877089
was scarcely the work of a momenti cannot blame myself for	 3.916848783585564
day	 3.8231815308134727
yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine	 3.6831054820180813
feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn	 3.7483901103872217
sisters mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man i am	 3.7227620833131376
cousins manners were not altered by his marriage his formal civility	 4.318352521318088
favourite child at that moment she cared for no other her younger	 3.7660026387028953

give which a just sense of shame would not conceal with a strong	 4.8542334583831295
her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined	 3.5003194493907763
upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections or	 3.5917856559135366

of which we have been advertised by the same authority your daughter	 4.441872025069656
done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and	 3.9251938809372313
her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy	 3.3496035975561798

questions but answered them very composedlylady catherine then	 3.5678006950539847
fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves	 3.0573617457714195
hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the	 3.6008742191453957

to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known	 4.91722914301344
sentimentif you have not been mistaken here i must have	 3.7108922472176618
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that	 5.199084166056276
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford every eye was in	 4.021092397448459
you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr bingley did	 3.3663781989652146
very wellthat reply will do for the presentperhaps by and bye i	 4.364553593787412
behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest	 4.002863518822052
very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so	 4.318357521613741
do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel lady	 3.0366150228318407
amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no	 4.644649819148096

elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for	 3.684840615051687
love	 4.0011070780879905
a long dispute followed this declaration but mr bennet was firm it	 3.9407693047104897
i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir such very	 3.277472361049358
spare from me you are all to come to pemberley at christmas	 3.790968153789383
cannot afford it and what claims has lydia what attractions has she	 4.0423801037234055
consented as she went up stairs to get ready mrs bennet followed her	 3.027945497203702
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation	 3.8167194663684976
where is your sister said he hastily as he opened the door	 3.762321795815703
was to admit an idea so destructive of janes happiness and so	 4.117996572837892
him you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence	 4.020941668414765
assure you it is a pity they are not handsome not that i think	 4.373498567706067
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character her mind	 4.061739332831764
yes she did	 3.3231373529304142

joke	 1.962759145445629
been just as likely to marry her had she been his relation	 3.7455938209786233
whom we shall deprive you	 3.870527360565846
to be secure of judging properly at first	 4.694064556018239
mr darcy took her advice and did finish his letter	 3.141119868327701
you are uniformly charming cried he with an air of awkward	 3.0023930199255098
longbourn mr gardiner was a sensible gentlemanlike man greatly	 3.5808823311225617
arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe	 4.481135890878892
about this report did she call to refuse her consent	 4.103246129690378
probably notbut mr darcy can please where he chuses he does not	 3.937400288440172
calculation are heavy indeed but perhaps added he stopping in his	 3.8641804543122364
of her sisters ready acquiescence	 3.23468625558647
international donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make	 3.54493209738137
supposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps till the	 3.4324909300950392
discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss	 4.507081895493828
review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possible	 4.216032570969736
states compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a	 4.752690520857555
catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions	 3.2136211013665763
within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so	 3.8020355000422192
mary wished to say something very sensible but knew not how	 3.591181277817545
my dear mr bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome you	 3.032453693531557
gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the	 4.847925657257165
servants remained but when they had withdrawn he said to her mrs	 3.7402257649748867
not help saying	 3.8162249025092714
find it not equal to lydias for him she had scarcely needed her	 3.76248041701976
arranging miss de bourghs footstool that she said mr collins you	 4.918560869894442
is miss darcy much grown since the spring said miss bingley will	 4.117278052771864

table what do you think it is excellent news capital news and about	 3.454144690350536
them would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his	 4.801452445259624
worth knowing after all	 4.151792611134875

you are severe on us	 3.6119222010724474
herself in love and to consent to an elopement she was then but	 4.035914035419633
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather	 4.4214087954147745
must be paid within <NUMBER> days following each date on which you	 3.358597914954074
engagements that had been made for him he had never before supposed	 4.622782515430815
flirtation and officers have been in her head she has been doing	 3.8161101684578274
vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a	 4.573552400818843
may often meet again	 3.332273681993752
seemed a gulf impassable between them had lydias marriage been	 4.478560099435712
brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from that very wish	 4.166597940519575
la you are so strange but i must tell you how it went off we were	 3.8159183038815354
the compliment of such a mans affection and though her intentions did	 4.146566789889695
removing all my doubts i am not indebted for my present happiness to	 4.510502749454558
in three volumes	 2.76706910742907
and what am i to do on the occasionit seems an hopeless business	 3.5544719168807526
that remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than	 5.299922612865903
capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome	 3.4915934560802353
it is from miss bingley said jane and then read it aloud	 3.5554095652086137
appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such	 3.406307809492394
her sisters ruin still more certain and even jane who believed still	 3.451076623273991
taken into the house and as soon as they were in the parlour he	 4.282541223202711
as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and	 3.47043344492549
consequence of any reply mr collins might never make the offer and	 3.1712598037522475
had been taken in thirdly she trusted that they would never be happy	 4.335490876820103
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had	 3.5290279666703577
how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his	 3.7522342136735665
oh you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general	 4.136443526079172
engaged with mr darcy that they scarcely ever saw him i found that	 3.591833412153208
possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every	 3.7616664891010303
when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth	 3.5624839799846972
children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago	 4.465102988578202
but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object	 3.7376195092784807
bingleys regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the	 3.8056047903240597
may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer	 4.085831700987038
elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her fathers speech was afraid	 3.806889988954992
conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage	 5.010456201791127
asked her how she had liked him her answer was warmly in his favour	 3.8783918000312814

elizabeths feelings was every moment increasing she was quite amazed	 3.44816187892483
recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which	 3.326162889866725
she held out her hand he kissed it with affectionate gallantry though	 4.158328439823535
ever was seen	 3.6011691456107293
she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell	 4.562846794914041
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of	 3.7660683573687628
janes disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest	 3.2827398246163293
beauty mrs long said so too for i asked her whether you did not and	 3.4350596481215083

very undeserving young manand i do not suppose there is the least	 3.785868911261186

colonel fitzwilliam he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man he	 3.21946161060793
all expect janes good fortune	 3.4271208932523662
enough to provoke him elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet was	 4.910926552061651
without one of her sisters	 4.263961335975052
weeks at rosings and asked him if he were acquainted with the former	 3.9206623564970657
himself and she seized the opportunity of saying	 4.467406518802158
there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel	 2.65349836614808
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must	 4.196805398855672

the deficiency of his her father had been an attorney in meryton and	 3.962440538733743
the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would	 2.942683648521903
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you	 3.651827333052853
aye so it is cried her mother and mrs long does not come back	 3.3578808971105847
but consider your daughters only think what an establishment it would	 3.6735121722523982
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state if therefore she	 3.3707975542239272
it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion	 3.1941615872541655
all to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did	 3.410294317122718
us whether it is like or not	 3.381500690659392
that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass	 3.946892630412682
returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given	 3.242547870664549
i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected	 3.1467866482595386
my father and maria are to come to me in march added charlotte and	 3.6260217896839517
she were married to him tomorrow i should think she had as good a	 3.640684420874352

asked for every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left	 3.968948740316894
if you had rather not	 3.5410307212903023
have been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the	 3.399800150408283
mr darcy is not to be laughed at cried elizabeth that is an	 3.696091275772999
this my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers	 3.828802879867543
guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to	 3.751555672439625
have thought it and is it really true oh my sweetest lizzy how rich	 3.1927027626567654
various creditors of mr wickham in and near brighton with	 3.545027675768159
verdure of the early trees she was on the point of continuing her walk	 4.3454105364734765
while mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village	 3.3785531662614976
of his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine with less of	 3.4338208141215705
a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant	 3.415851513677745
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country it	 3.721044340579941
	 3.4746791836985214
herself with and one too who had probably been his own companion from	 3.240190667657862
consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no	 5.323829124364909
she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages	 4.072653747162461
looks sickly and crossyes she will do for him very well she will	 4.897860370540322
disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to	 3.636789141497831
blush he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immoveable from	 3.842108811141345
harmless from all liability costs and expenses including legal fees	 3.9790266270157475
scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir william	 3.495597991509067
elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of	 3.0885653565993167
my own such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might	 4.265382623560837
unpardonable i cannot think of it without abhorrence	 3.8570257271496433
the first part of mrs gardiners business on her arrival was to	 3.313772143010071
so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will	 3.5407228235918455
fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect	 4.93010822592094
making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally	 3.915414499741143
house but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the	 3.5911343954763755
mrs gardiner abused her stupidity if it were merely a fine house	 4.067483884289706
the case	 3.3773522471380883
lord what will become of me i shall go distracted	 3.936378542144765
comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it	 3.302016494623357
removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that	 4.590232642635903
serious attachmenti had often seen him in love beforeat that	 3.7612764614944503
collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of	 4.065090255280819
impatiently met her at the door of the dressingroom to ask why lady	 4.571300185106718
quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the	 4.619598420498293
in the evening soon after mr bennet withdrew to the library she saw	 4.124786236004913
about a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject	 4.1048290752421845
dr gregory b newby	 2.343172003769056
who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the	 3.8588895082726906
composedlylady catherine was a tall large woman with	 4.196689777797318
and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they	 4.088652971690221
indeed he has no improper pride he is perfectly amiable you do not	 3.6527458341756236
the scorn	 2.613821824868645
admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because	 3.9221084450845556
attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and	 2.7108009055491262
yes she will remain there till christmas	 3.459294681216511
it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose	 2.916299075897397
absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that	 3.73717032503597
the effect was immediate a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his	 4.132876201663362
i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left	 3.2701924564914777
thank you for explaining it so fully my faults according to this	 4.8342134373335135
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity	 3.40912410409534
punctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a diningroom up	 4.056052522087526
better mr collins was eloquent in her praise the subject elevated him	 4.4911145388293825
shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by	 3.7807086545216753
writer that could give her any comfort miss darcys praise occupied	 3.081714436677755
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which	 4.212073764536287
such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to	 3.0160689217978374
the objections which had made him prevent his friends marrying her	 3.2972465158114783
i have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him	 3.6849709548362917
darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject at	 4.659206980626777
yes replied wickhamhis estate there is a noble one a clear ten	 3.3089923136136083
the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that	 3.683331027067665
hate you i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take	 3.355534853989852
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour	 3.950799906934887
i cannot believe it why should they try to influence him they can	 2.8900137247246778
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home	 4.3547477307369284
quality or other real or imaginary vanity and pride are different	 3.2460871468916688
made an offer to lizzy and she will not have him	 3.797361908935011
would make you sonay were your friend lady catherine to know me i	 3.7567523887967686
approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter	 4.37076222353681
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry	 3.2096085022211565
mind	 3.4870637385587475
find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hatedo not wish me	 3.4075706138158037
mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge where he	 3.6328741339121633
works	 3.840278858884792
indeed without much graciousness but mrs bennet was satisfied and	 4.053967498717731
elizabeths anger against him had been long done away but had she	 3.494286825208589
good gracious mr darcyand so it does i vow well any friend of	 3.674252939497676
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the	 4.542593511255927
mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command	 3.3725434068992883
many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few	 3.442560456312623
officers who in comparison with the stranger were become stupid	 3.470699799679366
every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father	 3.2351486018646525
miss elizabeth bennet repeated miss bingley i am all astonishment	 3.1725497037180865
herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to	 4.943519398823556
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life and where	 4.230257004093309
mr collinss letter and after laughing at her some time allowed her	 3.927563268365067
gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off	 3.8187335395281368
extraordinary kindness she was treated with elizabeth silently attended	 4.706259432955125
listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she	 3.7156990441830655
dear lizzy is very great my father and mother believe the worst	 3.276861426859236
imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other	 4.704233353880232
shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well	 3.8657669380085675
regard it that she would never look in it again	 4.17634466443431
towards mr wickham i know not in what manner under what form of	 3.6968184707069485
as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they	 5.310043334933517
himself to produce a more valuable soninlaw	 3.712712179997456
it is your turn to say something now mr darcyi talked about	 3.2035401738175584
mr bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that	 3.3874076176993353
seriously assured her of its truth	 3.81086240306208
i am sure why janeyou never dropt a word of this you sly thing	 3.483307797242715
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of	 4.3885790240004665
of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished	 3.403604076370883
certainly not at first but they are very pleasing women when you	 3.5756783987995604
but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i	 3.2997347316334515
no she would go home i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies for	 4.1746880744821
it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant	 3.5197375304686087
had allowed her to apply i am confident that she would have performed	 4.784857453338669
at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs hurst and	 3.360913740300276
acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it were it known to the rest	 3.596894088124902
longer hope to be benefited by it she wanted to hear of him when there	 4.367517097351704
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her	 3.5484368441495495
but you will know it when i have told you what happened the very	 3.440791723434503
next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky	 3.6604626601167864
convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely	 4.8236884218870175
bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with	 3.202593107816261
laughingly answered	 3.312057548809722
choice the next morning however made an alteration for in a quarter	 4.313151203528526
chapter xiv	 1.9070367688535859
when they parted lady catherine with great condescension wished them	 3.40387045314395
it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been things	 3.8737808474681286
lovely and amiable when darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley	 4.189767680437039
mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a	 4.531275527496527
herthese are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and	 3.5014673367435223
any beauty in her her face is too thin her complexion has no	 4.1051161221172405
well oh that i had been with you you have had every care and anxiety	 3.9161772794866567
elsewhere	 1.962759145445629
family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but	 4.651207709132501
that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be	 3.2156255911439926
eminent physicians this she would not hear of but she was not so	 4.120368668953355
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good	 3.252423235561554
congratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly	 3.0200858905884975
parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of	 3.958220613183034
gbnewby<MENTION>	 1.962759145445629
and i have another favour to ask will you come and see me	 3.45618957239067
dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading	 3.244050731349144
tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor she was	 3.1635389530435374
every body hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them	 3.661564685726101
allwhat all five out at once very oddand you only the	 3.1504940882927177
perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had	 3.7566306986868536
gallery mrs reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his	 3.4825080523607315
child and now heres mr bennet gone away and i know he will fight	 4.111310623946088
as these but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the	 3.9785455186179157
well lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so the	 3.166016249930303
accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as i am	 3.687262742281193
became by proper attention and management less irritable less	 3.85099266178731
look into the park the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had	 3.726728484623161
communicativeness by his questions and remarks mrs reynolds either	 3.7518388699378145
unwilling to comply with their brothers proposal and it was settled	 3.7167833355326425
it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way	 3.52527912096827
elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude	 3.6672060321813333
you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your	 3.4904259681490513
haste and come down this moment	 3.3537591933768987
entered the breakfastroom and congratulated both him and herself in	 4.010798976780654
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth	 4.502413524591323
the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for	 3.833931966843456
rapturous air the fine proportion and finished ornaments they followed	 4.846972134065466
bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life she	 3.716380478428193
one morning about a week after bingleys engagement with jane had been	 3.430504092309154
derbyshire and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not	 3.3754834180363606

all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshireand give me	 4.489857821596953
of my fellow creatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it	 4.36931236387428
occupied she might have forgotten where she was reflection must be	 3.870374621991444

i like her appearance said elizabeth struck with other ideas she	 3.2230243627187645
i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza	 3.276951715324121

visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his	 4.235422267351548
mrs bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain	 3.4013673068520927
lizzy i never gave you an account of my wedding i believe you were	 3.4424721243832517

his mind was visible in every feature he was struggling for the	 5.123575161109669
i wish i could say any thing to comfort you replied elizabeth but	 3.0675635299209723
sisters in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a	 5.081524085491276
that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in	 3.1821862563370167
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be	 3.870061659003921

and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should	 3.1084862746944366
awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage	 4.770318659589848
but my dear you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into	 3.252710747957393
calm and conciseand soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte	 2.722648313842296
dreadful at length in a voice of forced calmness he said	 3.458529691475564
i believe maam i may safely promise you never to dance with him	 3.4309706795509616
farther to wish	 3.981266592606417

misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the	 3.5733433602421334
he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be	 3.4933963326072894
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly	 3.6000767620594534
sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a	 4.989990456250981

and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the	 3.8881365816828874
on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the	 4.390387926443299

elizabeth now began to revive but not long was the interval of	 4.10615780992988

elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply	 3.970401023645665
letters always were looked over her and read it likewise it was as	 3.4711326030942415
female of the family mrs bennet chose to consider it as given in	 3.2885511794043523

appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting	 3.5832671406825534
mrs gardiner with their four children did at length appear at	 3.04869799287776
she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets	 4.150257178505352
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i	 4.247464091591518

mr darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching	 3.424388374602109
when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley were	 3.7115747024004397

him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of	 4.054265334180719

as sincere as her brothers in sending it four sides of paper were	 4.809375870127538

which was no less his due than his desert you have done all this and	 3.834403862088876

this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another	 3.601545250734577

mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large	 4.0907016876245335

amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us	 4.561091105555717
his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to	 3.644414337597011
mei believe it will be better that he should not i see the imprudence	 4.2787827857062215
ring and boast of being married to mrs hill and the two housemaids	 4.256631994885415
marryingand moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of	 3.1614557069165174
in a short time i shall have a daughter married mrs wickham how well	 3.525926758270086
to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of	 3.2752173602947376
liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant	 3.7187571538892885
darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her how could	 3.8867336236909207
the storm was blown over at such a moment the arrival of her friend	 3.626105282363362
she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly	 4.21479665928785
soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my	 3.7022291487797947
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingleys designs on him	 4.23151993008839
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of	 3.7573357545144823
did as the day of his arrival drew near	 3.9903360532716667
manoeuvre of mrs bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of	 4.06854652863887

mr wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was he	 3.638760922565928
may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr and	 3.973466410931346
dear to have given him one of your set downs i quite detest the man	 4.03893986502425
sometimes found before that an event to which she had looked forward	 3.5803642961272035
fun herewhat do you think has happened this morningmr collins has	 3.6820231314982435
ready to think your own children silly if i wished to think slightingly	 3.452538172989414
when you have killed all your own birds mr bingley said her mother	 4.099950219442013
youand so i warn youi have done with you from this very dayi	 3.5925482521190126
looked the gentleman but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attention	 3.422116410031175
catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to	 3.689446682047783
unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sisters having the pleasure	 3.4196692312986148
very gravelybut i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all	 3.689702396917741
the generality of female minds but i confess they would have no charms	 4.3135891728309
agreeable companion but on the following morning every hope of this	 3.482502746386611
first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would	 4.571392801393208
forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible	 3.9573915696973456
wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of	 3.9008876076391825
stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppicewood which bordered	 3.685971732219721
more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that	 4.15511047403257
two eldest by jane this attention was received with the greatest	 3.108647886027698
talking to bingley she looked at his two sisters and saw them making	 3.3472832495375218
london would agree with lady lucas	 3.398904360913619
decidedly for so young a personpray what is your age	 3.347813162876542
had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her	 3.580219870803144
in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced	 3.479297455281873
stairs together mary and kitty were both with mrs bennet one	 3.633925580925791
removal was soon evident lady catherine had been rendered so	 3.9999115388213
was his neighbour till sir william thus began	 3.639938801502952
credit that he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than she	 3.9794347240329904
had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and	 5.267201583395968
must own that she was tired of great houses after going over so many	 3.9210365456087755
it may do very well for the others replied mr bingley but i am	 3.501654412573036
appearance of acquaintance was dropt how he lived i know not but	 3.2972059199618036
they then sat down and when her enquiries after rosings were made	 3.4566508706664543
be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself	 4.363297373243552
the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of	 3.5122597590948965
and thither also went mr wickham undoubtedly by design for there	 3.326391357937272
place	 4.155682776283025
when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself as	 4.267770333913995
hurry and confusion of the following hour had elizabeth been at leisure	 4.72950901848562
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour	 3.2663460524001824
were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition	 3.307409163343102
in as short a time as mr collinss long speeches would allow every	 3.442813739512168
defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity	 3.949271149354139
very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour	 3.749649245983538
will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here	 4.65843450790659
while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on any one else	 3.8488171128017363
give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of	 3.5622367286955514
impossible no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his	 3.9702656544109223

a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she	 3.9827676208456264
the terms of this agreement you must cease using and return or destroy	 3.8919685573135014
short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles of the whole	 4.9462832030518875
i can easily believe it you thought me then devoid of every proper	 3.7037102939606146
jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he	 4.106242910852909
had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on	 3.6106735583798253
uneasy the period which passed in the drawingroom before the	 3.3404596280275802

for the night and mrs bennet with great politeness and cordiality said	 3.5315508704720497
that is as it happens it does not necessarily follow that a deep	 3.833859460920853
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by	 3.5706496248200725
unsuitable a match the strangeness of mr collinss making two offers	 4.119122249256172

to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her	 3.574125541993427

first you may remember	 3.4418646903935866
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other	 3.7426372761732574
she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to	 3.5109123350738534
moment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly	 3.2299558224503926
increased by every review of it that she should receive an offer of	 3.645742363344491
he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading	 3.630234649792715
were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them if youll believe	 3.6916294293173015
much as possible here leading the way through every walk and cross	 3.2238766533221974

friends why could not he keep on quarrelling with you as his father	 3.492536823251012
thought the same and added	 3.7655703495217754

the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a	 4.026363666504205
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation	 3.8885052471775894
but not before they went to brighton	 3.634289417785116
the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just	 3.282927139713566
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so	 3.5690541881567226
writing i would not give up mr collinss correspondence for any	 4.054194658280716
my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncles	 3.26741494751691
good deal the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are	 3.6493554306959077
unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the	 3.611402764578175

found that jane had no intelligence to give the sanguine hope of good	 3.599910592367186
urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly to receive her	 4.08391217605145
ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening	 5.3090896070520355
concealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject	 3.207643354698335
her praise of mr bingley before expressed to her sister how very much	 3.7705093487474945
actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to	 4.08930584138361
two days after mr bennets return as jane and elizabeth were walking	 3.460635545975902
he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his	 4.5539951236600125
occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man	 5.01690315978554
placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable she	 3.811992985967157
repinebut to be sure it would have been such a thing for me the	 3.5066259334584755
brother is the cause of it i need not explain myself farther and	 3.6755570274095346
access to the full project gutenbergtm license must appear prominently	 2.9803315006687896
this is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me a	 3.1864048770334685
and do you really know all this cried mrs gardiner whose curiosity	 3.180985321367453
of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern	 3.141491552717422
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1e<NUMBER> with	 3.274020810208706
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations	 3.7118797603752345
mrs bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to	 3.5817611495423876
of a good fortune must be in want of a wife	 3.2510641768938475
marry and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had	 5.1154986689313375
himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain	 3.717801197314703
circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among	 3.9117939522836753
discussed that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking mr	 3.8776145218010516
thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of	 4.331214540894448
ambition will ever be gratified i came to try you i hoped to find you	 3.3378823789311483
heard his claims on mr darcy and all that he had suffered from him	 5.257850646165109
done she had a less active part to play it became her turn to listen	 3.59119128664067
you go to brightoni would not trust you so near it as east bourne	 4.0259525593400545
wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the	 3.0746558610919035
intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance	 3.3107137492065384
in three volumes	 2.76706910742907
frequently recurring the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters	 4.69853221710743
that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be	 3.97193585689828
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word after a short pause	 3.4280331528036423
than yourself or jane at most you know pretty well i suppose	 3.1765164394105017
did not know him in the least lord how i laughed and so did mrs	 4.458066948395844
mr wickhams adieus were much more affectionate than his wifes he	 3.202436386790978
most creditable to his heart i am sincerely grieved for him and	 5.775718006443363
significant look and smile from mrs annesley to miss darcy had been	 3.8273199968070664
half an hours quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join	 4.212928371868786
elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to	 3.4693810817017416
said	 3.7896947203083573
formerly have rejoiced in its termination	 3.5109804395299093

he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a	 4.049101690678749
suppose as my dear charlotte informs me that this licentiousness	 3.8707469540753587
because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it yes miss	 4.5069591660746
such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to	 3.5044562584965253
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised	 3.8409802717909534
neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown and even when it	 4.194937070002663
had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after	 3.465258419117486
listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all	 3.739012107163317
him replied the other elizabeth thought this was going pretty far	 3.3078127862426663
me we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our	 4.028471484204963
be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling	 3.4577788315781333
bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and mr bennet spent the	 5.002297048980582
minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to	 4.22926135638537
we never had any governess	 3.6206845967061585
cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its	 3.697943768474679
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickham has created a	 4.237677509777843
who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the	 3.591915277826541
these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth but the wife of mr	 3.553153094707712
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps he addressed	 4.382209134071875
sincerely wish him happy	 3.8805534242913775
often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my	 5.071707883293912
may i ask to what these questions tend	 2.955966852285323
relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore	 4.875644968610779
no but it must be done soon	 3.8826554380616707
this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss	 3.2473698137146814
wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were	 4.18728462325562
without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing	 3.1419925501208095
be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance i dearly love a	 3.2260665095983074
anything	 1.962759145445629
sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case	 3.873825328442214
darcy had walked away to another part of the room she followed him with	 3.89981982010388
her and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte	 4.067328295936665
probability of a rainy season made her feel that the commonest	 3.440924926212808
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his	 4.509574532605908
she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to	 4.334853095354444
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly it had given him a	 3.3277520713984114
he looked surprised displeased alarmed but with a moments	 4.373024020920273
wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his	 4.3071547595437565
pemberley property he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy a most	 3.945879663458213
mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation	 4.330897677853407
you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of	 3.898852134760067
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on	 5.040968515792926
miss bennet i am shocked and astonished i expected to find a more	 3.376091952720812
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after	 3.753051049356756
no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to	 3.6026626177067875
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which	 4.301302998612568
could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to	 4.01393660890176
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole	 4.5664645719480355
on reaching the house they were shewn through the hall into the saloon	 3.9777588140547815
i am sure i know none so handsome but in the gallery up stairs you	 3.222402549515623
why will you think so it must be his own doinghe is his own master	 4.037417776468618
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told	 5.14916682934018
after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter mrs bennet was	 5.114576176310406
she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could	 4.237485770324048
you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but	 3.2425181277039643
mother and kitty made inevitable and could she have included jane in	 3.514950161358272
he paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed to	 3.368158774967012
come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult	 5.489886811835203
conversation passed by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom	 4.124647455598432
give them as unstudied an air as possible	 3.568885195263665
every body says that he is ate up with pride and i dare say he had	 3.8069851990209886
reply to his last	 3.7766392857101203
mrs bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments	 2.858895320568543
turned to his daughter and said	 3.6811031319180225
thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed in	 4.185311669252328
therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house	 4.073897801704116
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure	 4.548358128366454
till next week you would probably do it you would probably not	 3.583172104295217
side and had any thing of the kind been perceptible you must be aware	 4.4186280747432045
little agreeable to her	 3.6018480123393344
good luck i may meet with another mr collins in time	 3.4861342528597774
he should stand his ground yet he had avoided the netherfield ball	 4.722046793502229
could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings	 4.2072390877867285
be from lady catherine and she anticipated with dismay all the	 4.394422438628164
which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the	 4.8438230190641205
inconvenience	 1.962759145445629
know it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him	 5.300374121239266
often does because there is an excuse for it one cannot wonder that so	 3.430471551381959
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared	 3.439099377171772
that is a failing indeedcried elizabeth implacable resentment	 4.212884903734434
say that i hate the very sight of him	 3.891986443977575
mr darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said you cannot	 3.8099069567552455
defective the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i	 3.9568884412022896
she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent	 4.159087763582262
that she talked as much as ever but her mind was so busily engaged	 4.11554245195186
are grievously to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined	 5.159953279689536
