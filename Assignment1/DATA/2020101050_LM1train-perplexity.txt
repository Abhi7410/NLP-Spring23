nothing more to plague her on his account	 4.765789104528019
to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many	 4.2053548757616666
to be secure of judging properly at first	 4.716086824902685

the country at present a few weeks he believed	 3.4554618326963253
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his	 4.630809274282785
philipss manners and politeness he protested that except lady	 3.829679956306145
mrs bennet and mrs philips was an amiable intelligent elegant	 3.4605701161513482

at whist enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearing	 5.460172821561476
to driving him out in his gig and shewing him the country but when he	 4.780502857018794
if he had had any compassion for me cried her husband impatiently	 3.4148780675202586
other engagements might allow him to visit them	 3.2282012936345845
i honour your circumspection a fortnights acquaintance is certainly	 4.29044268743315

diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty and	 3.9565719242964352
misrepresented	 1.9356690691114107

she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself and to	 3.2467104729052374
my cousin elizabeth	 3.8481624842051683

i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they	 3.205891343454621
admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because	 4.016035526385523
all means to refuse him	 3.9928364902503017
in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the	 3.722466088224633
mrs hurst was observing their game	 3.1089581663369965

esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met	 3.6017332895128016
to the scheme	 3.4765948314903796

sister ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to	 4.0098364279240695
forgiveness the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlottes	 3.7296533279295763
mother you quite mistook mr darcy he only meant that there were not	 3.9425291057427265

hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls though	 4.4050644065879645
he is gone i never saw such a long chin in my life well but now for	 3.6410246276895397
tenderly she even shook hands with the formerelizabeth took leave of	 3.7594211839679015
reserve and want of proper consideration that wickhams character	 2.7050404090345346
you look as if you did not care about me	 3.038838436344273
and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump but	 4.5985565528605035
ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr	 4.258387065822835
sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the	 3.0374290315752024
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the	 3.9663953874874793
happened	 4.344694567668863
the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her	 3.510467238637249

either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object it	 3.2832078487197713
you are then resolved to have him	 3.1364992439076236

was less difficult to develope she was a woman of mean understanding	 4.395917172479025
sincerely wish him happy	 3.89196876723722
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds	 3.645171208413059
you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her allow me by the	 3.3786163682573016
elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately miss bingley	 2.978535469726764
kind	 3.9612307874053396
transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were	 4.111991934600664
body too who is likely to know	 3.531833298218441
say there will be some little money even when all his debts are	 3.357567132033069
works based on the work as long as all references to project gutenberg	 3.9127821600428914
mother you deserve no such attention i am most seriously displeased	 3.1261008013894234
concealment this disguise was beneath meit is done however	 5.172163600617473
and disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know what to say to	 3.734846142543431
the charge of her but i was overruled as i always am poor dear	 4.490262778102225
money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared	 3.1816518908222595
encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed onas to	 3.555556219356029
suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables	 4.310169348551629
united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a	 3.6502034876823624
forit is i believe too little yieldingcertainly too little for the	 3.328934631348525
i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of	 3.6054113389837297
the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often	 3.3749362312873705
accomplishedshe plays and sings all day long in the next room is a	 3.6948890535627816
and mrs collinss happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her	 3.6515703286950156
the next moment open the front door and quit the house	 3.480433402018769
able to see your friends before they leave the country but may we not	 3.3836173152118794
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no	 3.691053293946952
and then we were so merry all the way home we talked and laughed so	 3.744283751799936
do not you want to know who has taken it cried his wife impatiently	 3.2936938255576886
refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom	 3.3827475785642487
and of this place thought she i might have been mistress with	 3.886745864778226
elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse	 3.841629944596899
your attendance upon her has been too much for you you do not look	 3.9837249882068657
she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton	 3.488691104966714
extraordinary in them they have a sharp shrewish look which i do not	 4.310863277273044
by mrs collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter	 3.0907110566712976
at least it shews that she was serious in the object of her journey	 4.0687035683920225
journey and brought its master back to longbourn	 3.2689562815089244
their attachment but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot	 4.458938672746305
service is over i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will	 3.4696357960810276
me and teach you not to believe a word i say i am particularly unlucky	 3.630416016439088
its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means	 4.126668677638159
only think of its being three months she cried since i went away	 3.507695239301376
jane make haste and tell us make haste my love	 3.7389911907705837
for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham i longed to	 3.4615744768492758
lizzy i never gave you an account of my wedding i believe you were	 3.456841738165202
the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess after	 5.76775754565811

great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the	 4.226669591160143
i never can be thankful mr bennet for any thing about the entail	 4.3424704084716375

elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy she had been unwilling to	 5.067105213029252
been the case	 3.4457390686227254
elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them an hasty kiss	 3.44603060909729

elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for	 3.6651787030750187
mrs bennet who quarrelled with no compliments answered most readily	 3.46848231803469
and have you heard from him often	 3.0402967067251794
however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together	 3.35778098055278
i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more	 3.231375032228979

expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for	 4.492696081010539
all and then wickham would be angry	 3.293556773866809
so long in one attitude	 3.8198948086929376
abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most	 3.941214750737153
are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when	 3.7653290024789774
for it however mr wickhams happiness and her own was per force	 3.6132604014610816
as they concerned george wickham what a stroke was this for poor jane	 3.5184712030604173
saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at	 5.203658193275993
darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from	 4.338304456984597
hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the	 3.58968148737302

my part mr bingley i always keep servants that can do their own	 3.086235315587731
withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for	 4.427673335122316
requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing	 4.044842647972029
are my old friends i have heard you mention them with consideration	 3.349480121599602
dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken almost as	 3.1741769091891583
out of the room as they went down stairs together charlotte said	 3.187847683031208
foundation	 4.167344710411188
conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage	 4.946579832584099
received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia at first there	 3.350965458408168
comfort was that mr bingley must be down again in the summer	 3.6529555233807827
it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said	 4.050944045419493
the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not	 3.3750797248774185

out that mrs collinss joints of meat were too large for her family	 4.076383578401214
spirits and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had	 3.8464552027646324

took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and	 3.657073854074358
it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married	 3.568572326976966
darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her how could	 3.7182760039704847
as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits	 3.422628539301434
performed in a proper manner without any of those apologies and thanks	 3.520810863946423
it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that	 3.699056458579506
former prejudices had been removed	 3.8143984795552335
would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur	 3.7235629880699954

before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part	 3.2465372779284305
elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection	 3.274186179813047
library to write and the girls walked into the breakfastroom	 3.33579784362138
contrivance breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield	 3.3578556334048355
enough for expectation	 3.8349635227223597
notice the two first dances however brought a return of distress	 3.3036682026327107
this will not do said elizabeth you never will be able to make both	 3.8539805243399594
and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother said mr gardiner	 3.4742667933283795
injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady	 3.426389744541832
in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant	 3.8593029121289564

reason for his resolving to follow us there is a lady it seems a	 4.22567577895506

of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse any thing which he	 3.934508235345323
received and noticed as he was perhaps there was some truth in	 3.8200594603194302
of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss	 3.2957531083568554
remember that four evenings have been also spent togetherand four	 3.4887357583318797
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance to	 4.259466740946415
hard to have her taken such a way from me they are gone down to	 3.7717479204235236

i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham i can	 3.9389753308165645
i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever	 3.2322745365287724
by this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried	 3.6755803898834016
very little of his time there in future he has many friends and he is	 3.378008206792429
every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world and	 4.182171791763109
for good news the letter was read aloud mrs bennet could hardly	 3.3781738724951658
well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never	 3.375089515206369
deserve	 1.9356690691114107
dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all	 5.471058527024534
concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally	 3.265955999741076
for ever	 3.639656560472734
eat drink and play at cards who when he found her prefer a plain dish	 3.6288232101418827
omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected	 3.6031485881441596
she was shewn into the breakfastparlour where all but jane were	 3.867852490569594
or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she	 3.7850100192122347

your father was still with him but would quit town the next	 3.5454325476709982
bring no proof of its injustice she had never heard of him before his	 5.2232283640928765
it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their	 3.7108038509474683

mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of	 3.8998080124256442
on one side of your lawn i should be glad to take a turn in it if you	 4.293376444104124
by exclamations and inquiries about the other of whom however she	 5.017458566472793
when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant	 3.191708365872783
fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished since her	 3.813379198327384
opportunity	 4.430019454714271

dear madam cried mrs hill in great astonishment dont you know	 3.847886781698433
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former	 4.317535842678786
particulars it is not fair to condemn him it is not to be supposed	 5.2219702389083995
her with his best respects to all her family not forgetting his thanks	 4.166763698872992
very strenuously have opposed it you ought certainly to forgive them as	 4.496059058781439
voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to	 4.510156610660693
masterly manner which i see so many womens do they have not the same	 3.8085242867365032
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on	 5.0032041624296415
your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in	 3.2738057628707558
add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by	 4.794651031873941
to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is	 3.155900559882139
his father miss bennet the late mr darcy was one of the best men	 4.1760737819375295

sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeableallowing	 3.8052480599333904
collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much	 4.024897523409074
yes and i had heard it before but what is that to me if there is no	 3.680675002088259
she was wild to be at hometo hear to see to be upon the spot to	 3.427986772425476

something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had	 3.815180850908519
i have seen nothing of it	 3.4266098768857933
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of	 3.32493152170537
that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly	 3.8866825897876374
right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older	 3.405692558267318
and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry did he know of	 3.076988164744604
must always have esteemed him but now as bingleys friend and your	 4.055340541611471
you will be attended to	 3.718500622584862
party in a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing at the	 4.768951814157014

miss bennet do you know who i am i have not been accustomed to such	 4.354093794268053
natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings she was	 3.315010427280909
opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily	 3.4027818877472256
dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way but	 4.0843902853334635
and at length by repeated assurances that mr darcy was really the	 3.9707858605027364
at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often	 4.282933351433145
honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty	 4.93437650332768
november for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in	 3.6356657167771296
reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at	 3.402805032098511
before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in	 4.072485454475831
sisters mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man i am	 3.990395369286911
reserve and caprice that the experience of three and twenty years had	 3.7430201762646234
wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark	 5.5598513821730755
his plan did not vary on seeing themmiss bennets lovely face	 4.1169849335238355
you already use to calculate your applicable taxes the fee is	 4.801468784412196
two days after mr bennets return as jane and elizabeth were walking	 3.423628658523497
that he was asking some odd unconnected questionsabout her pleasure in	 4.7472234548910786
lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me how little did you	 4.323342286426287
appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such	 3.321299856712822
conversation in which she had no sharelouisa you will not mind my	 4.509680227743976
almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to	 3.4057252983930675
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would	 3.239179022476781
exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given	 4.924189389821127
the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged	 3.2153475680736294
than when they last met were plainly expressed she was disappointed	 3.388445694171658
and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful	 4.546051739188572
as i sit by the fire	 3.1874351699344303
pleasantry her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in	 3.463822512289747
i know them a little their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike	 3.3170385852347604
an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not	 4.1814217949955035
and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i	 4.670453425969364
but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing they have	 3.342619249895721
it places mr darcy to be treating his fathers favourite in such a	 4.256873643298739
all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her	 4.115772686463269
elizabeth longed to observe that mr bingley had been a most delightful	 4.724574717854639
his side even more his present pursuit could not make him forget that	 3.590291124094774
any thing about it they found at last on examining their watches that	 3.765412062344269
know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a	 4.67653878827216
woody hillsand in front a stream of some natural importance was	 4.003852565508132
advantageous by you i was properly humbled i came to you without a	 4.760081293768436

in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses i dare say the	 3.6220620258552296
not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his	 3.687295089178087
bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very	 3.5072261116275842

know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his	 4.777994674351903
from all the others when they sat down to table she had only to say in	 3.339704743872113
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with	 3.1255793824104416
assurance i require	 3.2542393325532273
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless	 3.9001221195191884

drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do he delighted in	 3.5535542218640845
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched	 4.924543611161361

it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the	 3.3148632331168586
very intelligible gallantry	 2.9904679970762866
enough to say before how much i like him his behaviour to us has	 3.3570062288412297

what he had related himself and the kindness of the late mr darcy	 3.2063269374786323
fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they	 4.141766287414022

on that point what relates to yourself is as follows having thus	 3.6012317245998147
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at	 3.2008960786163625
be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself	 4.218402244192444

conversation beginning with his parsonagehouse and leading naturally	 5.115134543212065
that led to the copse elizabeth was determined to make no effort for	 5.159049428722661
perhaps he must if he sees enough of her but though bingley and jane	 4.2446692531573715

next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and	 3.5810072150560166
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding	 4.301096296834303
it	 2.983679824964844
you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of	 3.674356111440795

i dare say you will find him very agreeable	 3.4857969457189015
miss bennet i am shocked and astonished i expected to find a more	 3.552579022742296
matter	 4.2174456737478385
not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercisea	 3.2362501972633253

lydia was exceedingly fond of him he was her dear wickham on every	 3.243603472893894

the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five	 4.021037888606266
sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county	 3.624843655165658

i do not recollect that we did	 3.655637022171085
there can be no doubt of that it is settled between us already that	 3.8711320107999705
feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in	 4.360562481159571
a little more liveliness and that if he marry prudently his	 4.227859291360791

believing what i say i wish you very happy and very rich and by	 3.651662187792897
could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the	 3.3378838385300584
construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor	 3.294283005290022
as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned	 4.396266587644601
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward as all	 3.565859486027906
set out to meet him accidentally in the lane but little had she dared	 4.4135237221469295
they had often attempted it before but it was a subject on which mrs	 3.7593429903741593
utterly unknown to her before something he supposed might be attributed	 3.401800453901633
a novelty to them the party did not supply much conversation elizabeth	 4.463839264028231
certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but	 4.293584808505201
what had since passed to provoke her she lost all concern for him in	 3.7784095079978695
against the temptation of immediate relief they met several times	 4.133868104548323
might lead to the mention of her had he dared he observed to her at a	 4.131470041034918
as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife	 3.7597290198387903

solicitude they shewed for jane the apothecary came and having	 3.8187406324049133

she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power	 4.308550274887243
whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his	 3.772835030947048
custom and mary went up stairs to her instrument two obstacles of the	 3.5106413187504577

you will feel the effects of it no officer is ever to enter my house	 4.189773517593392
doubt i suppose of their being really married	 3.738315756166791
chapter xvii	 1.9302842045940272
considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least	 4.2514099042833795

varying the humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that	 3.7304643783723903
she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth perhaps she	 3.59179357422344

engagements that had been made for him he had never before supposed	 3.8738908212913086
overtaken by wickham	 3.498742056650565
he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all	 3.7538260745681273
saw him so affected poor kitty has anger for having concealed	 2.960086310462163
very young woman and very lately married a resemblance in good humour	 4.264435598094607
through her mothers hands lydias expences had been very little within	 3.9229660509324153

after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two	 4.329017787294832
together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman	 3.5152983539716582

as he joined her	 3.398787451934944
i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend	 3.684526612900108
mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while	 3.7602489359618287
they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them	 4.319097251810119
would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been	 3.4453319499464876
stiffness of manner and resentful silence he scarcely ever spoke to	 3.115764742751806

of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man i would	 5.583827319127927
it is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patience	 3.5385985248292666
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents	 4.724770034960251
accede to his proposal i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a	 3.726004923011843

of all that she had heard it was not to be supposed that any other	 3.4102467639537695
application and elegance as you describe united	 4.915225716815951
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing	 4.119773674078025

about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i	 2.8558337444495674
should ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia	 3.6388286237940535

themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the	 3.909515337405093
as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no	 3.0130937703188336
better things let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor	 4.49665466217598
father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits and	 4.417492079591265
thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me	 3.1108016480816656
other provocations you know i have had not my own feelings decided	 3.838238645126892
acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming	 3.721581688088187
persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town	 3.531276610281926
perfect as plan could be	 3.9077725125320355
if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley it	 4.693917936178138
since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of	 2.983172500696825
on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and	 4.198707922501539
she were married to him tomorrow i should think she had as good a	 3.7077183520937855
so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will	 3.499992117022793
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand jane now came up	 3.8619222027499114
be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling	 3.163304762729623
one of the windows	 2.7693779516382704
spoke she would have quitted the room had not mr collins thus	 4.4510218661604855
and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect	 4.1818993413782035
forget it ourselves they were off saturday night about twelve as	 3.8295316408838795
relieved by discerning such different feelings	 3.3539584946289716
distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at	 4.811885968863111
about it and to ask when mr denny comes back from town	 3.326836984855489
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had	 3.4102134778354447
all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister	 3.5795463407967767
the will the difference was great what wickham had said of the living	 3.7872635737538047
disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind	 4.642148531995976
required a thousand things may arise in six months	 4.594902436510362
felt a wish of enquiring his countenance voice and manner had	 3.8653759487996253
silence on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for	 3.477646595425444
saturday and to saturday he still meant to stay	 3.3522027327716715
that parish and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven	 3.3550693729397603
happy with him	 3.7177088930375852
her twice only think of that my dear he actually danced with her	 3.510983165117341
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively	 3.9007599969745548
pleasanter aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent	 3.4412289772970457
rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to	 3.203548712508394
my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for	 3.6743525619528175
insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of	 4.2945728508664445
sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks though her manner	 5.202487903957803
lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat	 3.7163347119574888
you must acknowledge to be true	 3.838263494619477
were particularly intimate sir william lucas had been formerly in trade	 3.9836851691047173

i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth but i do not	 3.7567392214572326

work b alteration modification or additions or deletions to any	 5.2554761522644915
likes with her	 2.8445699548283647
ladies were ready enough to talk and mr collins seemed neither in need	 3.7403349446375493
she is grown so brown and coarse louisa and i were agreeing that we	 5.178245137772666
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth	 4.371873299241159
take us all there for the summer it would be such a delicious scheme	 4.44293530485516

opened by a servant and mr darcy appeared her pale face and impetuous	 3.692292681022188
but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by not	 3.3733596378999895
and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs bennets	 4.3331337889551005
as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution from	 4.089691073401145
doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it	 3.4354802911300975
if i were you	 2.9624148221765148
you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings	 3.7174671265606043
collins then returned to elizabeth	 3.4668623257673894
moved mr jones says we must not think of moving her we must trespass	 4.299726199160975
which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the	 5.063631802952686
they were of course all intending to be surprised but their	 4.527819135696669
piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no	 3.344599521331373
i assure you the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw the	 3.603470708243517
wednesday and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be	 4.5161811604435425
bingley if she could but lizzy oh sister it is very hard to think	 3.1276904565606234
how hard it is in some cases to be believed	 4.65100059882687
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the	 3.2795131895392595
to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and	 3.668362629965603
dear sir	 3.01466236599449
always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he told	 4.12542173617056
excuse me when he knows all and tell him i will dance with him at	 3.877546127518606
the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always	 3.7015534922551097
dancing and his partner	 3.478793618272422
but i cannot think so ill of him many circumstances might make it	 3.197109275537713
sometimes one must speak a little you know it would look odd to be	 3.555208050076527
part of our youth was passed together inmates of the same house	 4.6177570590319075
would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the	 3.5667152523945527

did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him	 3.3766444035232457
almost every day they called at various times of the morning sometimes	 3.386674083564624

last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy	 4.330230553951638
refinements of polished societies	 2.4481656645765475
she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening	 3.341213494071057
favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress	 3.6964162590519436

hour was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied	 3.6398633400124383
bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of	 3.8212724481749234
it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who	 3.885832519052446
messages to his sister mr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet and	 3.5931919299161716
know his real character	 3.63881039418376
the good news quickly spread through the house and with proportionate	 4.1481019682817895
too full of lines under the words to be made public	 3.7916266154990477
i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a design of	 3.088656361058703
his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to	 3.6725041074904063
favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a	 3.427933592605478
friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two but	 3.3400750381483215
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn	 4.103095722401673
have been a daily witness of and altogether i trust it does not appear	 4.802079578061512
she will drop the acquaintance entirely	 4.353187161577979
fitzwilliam and myself about a year ago she was taken from	 3.3937302620627086

not as you represent it had she merely dined with him she might	 4.874775996084587
stay i do not know how long his regiment is there for i suppose you	 3.715649935401708
attribute in some measure to jealousy had the late mr darcy liked me	 4.0380352775200725
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away	 4.258748826638496

over the mantlepiece her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it	 4.057078211829238
opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody	 5.073965546305721
in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her	 3.169964118915387
children was so highly reprehensible but she had never felt so	 4.223314787544298
unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary	 2.963947392855968
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf	 4.588190746600267

you are quite right to have his errors made public might ruin him for	 3.418530366140205
unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be	 3.227302030079412
that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her	 3.4330304075962297
then said	 3.306340162342663

at length the chaise arrived the trunks were fastened on the parcels	 3.349914001270211
which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure i	 3.230582336117759
surprise his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of	 3.3667782887840834
the praise where it was due but lizzy this must go no farther	 4.100925126490325
she believed he might have the best informed mind	 4.405066890714836
affectionately taking her hand said in reply	 3.6055638986367886

he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation	 3.82453216072968
mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he	 3.1509363449724193
in spite of having been at st jamess sir william was so completely	 4.0543755512806605
recommend his suit	 2.5839909285998712
struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing and called out to	 4.4401989676612
her sister her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore to	 3.7676460117139414
door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she	 3.6326839168228218
elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table	 3.5316104033891147
all worth pleasing so high and so conceited that there was no enduring	 3.6357605108582796
i did hear too that there was a time when sermonmaking was not so	 4.218487480335569
me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i	 4.300702478287702
mr bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way you take	 3.5720648877803645
tranquillity	 1.9356690691114107

him except just now and then so do not put yourself to	 3.355370092222386
she when he knows who they are he takes them now for people of	 3.79680898344065
well mamma said she when they were all returned to the breakfast	 4.118427673955946
by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say mr darcy	 3.169842872028832
intimation of her knowing her master	 3.3728758457029735
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement there are a few	 4.356719825710285
she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as	 3.6124296774698665
a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if	 4.024143165049946
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she	 4.6643980940710374
heard the good news miss lydia is going to be married and you shall	 3.6436382314133655
how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from	 5.134875277738373
did you admire me for my impertinence	 3.3265267840227324
no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former	 4.679705334070464
consider how important every moment is in such a case	 3.821756684500247
came she sees them now very often standing in clarkes library	 3.5067767566497916
him more favourably spoken of by any one	 3.5152319601875717
to me i should not have been allowed to invite them	 3.7770449857300186
you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer	 3.447164387006641
uncommonly pretty	 4.003364659206029
effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country	 3.3762458375826485
neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth have any	 3.2862343529028353
mothers rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated	 5.306628462153424
removal was soon evident lady catherine had been rendered so	 3.1068894332941324
he is indeedbut considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we	 3.717490656480823
him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good	 3.824236121156934
you begin said she i can comprehend your going on charmingly when	 3.4576412497789875
evenings scrutiny that though she received his attentions with	 3.447368995362168
will drink to our good journey	 3.791971692259037
were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them if youll believe	 3.6881087154840713
not one of them i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good follies	 3.9637793929790366
welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smile to	 3.207814734919945
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as	 3.202478075454705
bingley	 3.0424283878244234
her being rather tannedno miraculous consequence of travelling in the	 3.638954114609806
for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it	 3.9475494959556405
perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better	 3.100716142310588
agitation gave more important intelligence it was to this effect	 3.8335825689183185
i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole	 3.131161290081105
gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her	 4.629826061742758
down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much	 3.8847485219970013
with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she	 3.1152800949382744
right my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how	 3.4853656047936545
in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of	 3.2074680731830636
my part except the shops and public places the country is a vast deal	 4.583725944338228
mothers permission for this address you can hardly doubt the purport	 3.3039883000951265
her husbands mr darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on	 3.4211202272135544
lord how unlucky there is not a bit of fish to be got today lydia	 4.959599424230182
doubt of my reception you shewed me how insufficient were all my	 4.427678977198163
girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawingroom	 3.6765711975609547
young woman in the countrybut it was not till the evening of the	 4.201618368170417
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement	 3.7114667401030057
number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham it had come	 3.8639840521674738
considered it as the deathwarrant of all possibility of common sense	 3.851974375432906
what is mr darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him i am	 3.850548150807491
idea of an accomplished woman	 4.083121689730304
not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic	 3.137307740019269
to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had	 3.5066872442052537
letter remained on her mind she was all surpriseall astonishment that	 3.720072076728815
and well laid out and to the cultivation of which he attended himself	 4.9292685375767045
that mrs bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected	 3.783506036005283
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which	 3.0528670864538063
twicehow much i shall have to tell	 3.1762016245190394
condescended to ask i now give it to you if you are resolved on	 3.822094161356945
irritable and completely under lydias guidance had been always	 3.7960491971673167
of saying much her own thoughts were employing her she expected every	 3.893862848603739
done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any	 3.19810225213965
waking mr hurst	 3.2050927490888945
of the silliest girls in the country i have suspected it some time but	 4.4291894119533435
to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this	 3.8903229587264696
deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the power of	 3.529525542502335
its contents as quickly complied with mrs bennet accompanied by her	 5.512747739584389
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i	 3.700894330659583
and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her	 3.978646745267187
to yield readilyeasilyto the persuasion of a friend is no merit	 4.378484726662946
has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise	 3.465978659723526
the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour	 3.969041363992361
i can much more easily believe mr bingleys being imposed on than	 3.3402667189239623
elizabeth was forced to go	 3.244339653467531
of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself	 4.308240722083598
wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of	 3.7428695796992484
did you go by the village of kympton	 3.29607427663317
daughters married its solace was visiting and news	 4.6805121933143
no more have i said mr bennet and i am glad to find that you do	 4.0386064665528725
expeditiously married in london than in scotland	 3.5040819673695562
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised	 3.8467633433259305
by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend	 4.019261849871827
for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect	 3.9462086161719805
at night she opened her heart to jane though suspicion was very far	 3.8516164577669314
at mr darcy there is a fine old saying which every body here is of	 3.6848491198587037
earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of	 3.5798314208329267
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was	 4.504948491583903
reflection and she sat in misery till mr darcy appeared again when	 3.1827790106856364
elizabeth tried to join in her fathers pleasantry but could only force	 3.376393844054451
mrs collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often	 4.471730746440516
acquainted with him and mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising	 4.257831317509691
the scheme every part of it would have been perfect	 3.787089966908513
regard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and mr bennet	 3.758954250047448
habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five	 3.61300362319323
elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his	 5.082675890105935
can scarcely conceive how they have tortured methough it was some	 4.648251623238197
receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that	 3.5079824196893066
her in every charm of air and address but she could remember no more	 3.824490929979876
the church door and every body had as much to say or to hear on the	 3.4826524254860196
absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that	 3.7877447821015435
if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your	 3.4179380514195437
they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in	 3.8949049184184026
such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to	 3.0364831213570183
and i ought to feel it	 3.591817632140933
other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial	 3.37227248651755
your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has	 5.778141290287089
affection of a sister elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her	 4.5713365639827765
from epsom all that is known after this is that they were seen	 3.9421674517863923
doubted not as the most generous of his sex but while he was mortal	 4.368992947637398
would be prevailed on to go back with us change of scene might be of	 3.1227583462668393
joke	 1.9356690691114107
back again and summer finery and summer engagements arose mrs bennet	 3.592507404403254
it ought to be so it must be so while he retains the use of his	 3.6701392592110356
my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncles	 3.311741635503629
mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal	 3.468503593019418
saturday the pain of separation however might be alleviated on his	 4.2133540743393345
brought back with great satisfaction a message from her ladyship	 4.027950924245875
this is not to be borne miss bennet i insist on being satisfied has	 3.9271091406281498
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business	 3.956400995123279
i care about it though he is nothing to us you know and i am sure	 3.4834615028198597
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained	 3.7911398010469424
was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation	 3.8716615053678436
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory she was now	 4.822684635256339
the housekeeper came forward and told them it was the picture of a	 3.2228375593685183
to do something or other about it	 3.3923782763137376
it with delight as they passed into other rooms these objects were	 3.6905043081543347
only seen at church	 3.635087127410783
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always	 3.8857721199386397
what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the	 4.031743722765481
in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your	 4.0136274650352135
patroness she is an arrogant conceited woman	 4.150552724864874
opened and darcy after a few moments recollection was not sorry for	 3.6238170338302464
lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue but mr	 4.310007020817796
letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not	 3.9506236923574
near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of	 3.616713901842805

i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed cried	 3.2095137876635746
but the gloom of lydias prospect was shortly cleared away for she	 3.646724026882468
their affectionate mother shared all their grief she remembered what	 4.643918154680174

arrival of her master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot	 3.236598427105728
this	 3.266998573781084
his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have	 3.4736600451625668

was repeated to colonel f who instantly taking the alarm set off	 3.160011021469886
interval of waiting appeared very long it was over at last however the	 3.331952441371914
out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me	 4.126502133986419
degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on	 4.132650225082497
with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected it was	 3.2059740730922512
generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to	 3.7423132776803816
should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of	 5.042420310899288
most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it	 3.77241117815747
officers at once	 3.765923202391583
by any of us	 3.7660163483280074
fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind	 3.92986594944289
the present distance	 3.42542849938294
large party for the ball and a report soon followed that mr bingley	 3.3888222505203482
to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke	 4.754585450758071
reputation which her marriage had given her	 3.1955417276145264
wishes to avoid seeing me he must go we are not on friendly terms	 3.5957167133459857
my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express themby which	 4.53810547137585
each other the balm of sisterly consolation	 3.660214349766422
any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of	 4.153313992994116
to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce the marriage	 4.180936516889937
in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that	 3.6936516570921674
my dearest love tell me what dish mr darcy is particularly fond of	 3.6250604348067528
observation whichever were the case though her opinion of him must be	 4.11022075742802

elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said	 4.201531538733517
richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself but the	 3.742027351782536
was not conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to	 3.7330257383063024
discourage him	 3.0721264677027396
this could not have happened	 4.6715695437191895
force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of	 4.068507494990974
but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this	 3.818307141839425
bourgh in this assemblyi am most thankful that the discovery is made	 4.867864166255871
stronglymarked features which might once have been handsome her air	 3.2049363814581686
first interview with its object and even before two words have been	 3.042858257158544
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it	 4.233933806228274
interest all her tender feelings and nothing therefore remained to be	 3.5331202948918317
retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected	 3.5765727354485106
whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably	 3.4129396850039724
and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge	 3.8648258250310628
and nothing at all to the others they were soon gone again rising from	 3.487085979859089
for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was	 4.066638115094349
said elizabeth but without scheming to do wrong or to make others	 4.275228406652606
will go when once they come to be entailed	 3.3855243625059024
indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored	 3.282071927870311
often does because there is an excuse for it one cannot wonder that so	 3.4492318398625166
good enough for him	 3.900153587196192
it is from miss bingley said jane and then read it aloud	 3.523374539833935
her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for	 4.134067628038186
forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she	 3.7863179944441816
engaged	 4.165162712498145
intention but mr darcy chose to doubt itor to treat it as a merely	 4.595250902772842
great pleasure in the power of choice i do not know any body who seems	 3.829906686799652
her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bingley and the	 4.265389542836339
raised them in her opinion her affections had been continually	 3.6027540859459397
impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it mr bingley	 2.852702026796566
when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her	 3.5997836320089305
concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being	 4.174946226912158
delighted with him he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely	 3.223526031156742
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without	 3.2724053832515536

elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said	 3.2018587614701914
would happen but who could have foreseen such an attention as this who	 4.1928137513275265
reasonable her expressions more moderate it would have spared her from	 4.238702774442925
which gave them meaning	 3.7951965301743855
frailty would have mortified her so much not however from any fear of	 3.5947942950371097
long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion and	 3.999030454638083
of the officers wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing	 3.803190034024829
thursday with me she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady	 3.4143640976072955

the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their	 3.910568342558456
between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those	 5.2328986867200316
the hour we could not be married all day but luckily he came back	 4.008997292748091
there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to	 5.1682626010650345
two young men one has got all the goodness and the other all the	 4.032969833149253

mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her	 3.2663010722590915
very oddyet it did and even a third it seemed like wilful	 3.8130775527161256
good luck they must all go to brighton that is the place to get	 3.544645758980619
pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted	 3.316804760716338
or why did he thus come a day before he was expected had they been	 3.489484958441456
yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise	 3.4999105244269617
elizabeth answered only by a slight bow her thoughts were instantly	 3.69448382539994
years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be	 3.9017363579751976
and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to	 3.8820202167251594
sphere he is a gentleman i am a gentlemans daughter so far we are	 3.6928719321346994
the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined	 3.305531626151477
the effect was immediate a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his	 4.128754173939714
i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my	 3.1353660745502148
mr collinss return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of	 3.493402007396984
very welland this offer of marriage you have refused	 3.541261141590366
house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally	 5.954966049664414
connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy	 3.325182370891232
consideration nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving	 3.781183339860196
disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a	 4.4236192222556125
while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to mr	 3.249884541195603

to be mistress of pemberley might be something	 3.8683808264247657
darcys in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and	 4.117254904995903
our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to	 4.281322876236816
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness	 4.04392967072968
elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from	 3.107732548899253
security for her husbands not being killed in a duel	 3.5954459562771794
marry earlythe last born has as good a right to the pleasures of	 3.6574371367701555
i must ask whether you were surprised said elizabeth	 3.137158558907436
than felt herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment	 3.799700949584534
person of ranksuch affability and condescension as he had himself	 4.956938562083189
have as little trouble in the business as possible when the first	 3.6839036028214887
mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him charlotte had seen	 3.176083555329034
is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year	 3.197766496610854
mr and mrs gardiner smiled elizabeth could not help saying it is	 3.38692513676291
never was i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr collinss	 3.2520736880164876
married you know at st clements because wickhams lodgings were in	 4.350900703641583
interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer	 3.5167856471237893
me but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well	 3.765465866590317
said mr bennet as he folded up the letter he seems to be a most	 4.706684407405108
oh cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted but it is so	 3.8112194041007497
brother is the cause of it i need not explain myself farther and	 3.697476882877547
sister or that i rejoice in my success towards him i have been	 4.51396101786682
trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so well	 3.8785739071744527
concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a	 3.7704048815582536
jane and till the morrow their going was deferred miss bingley was	 3.529800758308132
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your	 4.658167148193841
elizabeth said no morebut her mind could not acquiesce the	 3.8751265458394473
are two things that i want very much to knowone is how much money	 3.756537028196013
neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model there is not a	 3.9672879617224472
arranges the business just as he pleases	 3.4446926545128096
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves they repulsed	 3.9834653995971316
into silence and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the	 4.384619725060157
world i love and he is an angel i should never be happy without	 4.451431200546418
conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from	 3.575726428456623
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingleys dislike of her had	 3.545382183863994
quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight then returned	 3.6701410998975366
child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my	 5.092022172055133
1f5 some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied	 3.1232270185303705
nor i i am sure said miss bingley	 3.518710363121155
these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth but the wife of mr	 3.6942777420472837
meryton and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that	 3.6882987287756093
their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance	 3.887793859268582
mr bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided	 3.0748534141180968
fitzwilliams occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was	 4.195480870658627
daughters as janes marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of	 3.3233099731955007
in this room they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there	 3.364237751588844
charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty	 3.4137027724794615
there	 3.4039077057140776
minute description which wickham could give and in bestowing her	 3.5315324919934286
superior to his sister as well by nature as education the netherfield	 3.75550401835022
may i ask but checking himself he added in a gayer tone is it in	 3.4751168528959684
frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty	 3.372263858955693
the colour now rushed into elizabeths cheeks in the instantaneous	 3.299586576248841
forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some	 3.4224008275258133
off together	 4.375993325139384
this we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the	 3.955551177642007
disagreeable man all to yourself but i hope you will not mind it it is	 3.137747957415022
suddenly addressed her with	 3.7171206376302646
curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty	 3.5129363978380663
returns royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and	 3.8029154961607694
before he complimented mrs bennet on having so fine a family of	 3.3398443303159873
seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into	 3.2694949987081743
feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them my temper	 4.329366024378468
moments of such painful confusion	 3.553830795984872
vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is	 4.55806578025019
his manners are very different from his cousins	 3.6157630465812853
so much the better i hope they will not meet at all but does not jane	 3.0266221471323638
mrs jenkinsons room she would be in nobodys way you know in that	 3.90816008291155
hour her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was	 3.9090331430435343
we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire	 3.392875649061766
admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust	 3.3555867645472515
if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as	 3.7727737106938193
elizabeth it must be something particular to take him there at this	 3.2678697431563273
his love for you and there will be an end of the matter	 4.0200375130278525
most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me	 3.4939973412709002
feared w was not a man to be trusted my poor mother is really ill	 4.280955712252412
her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of	 4.518630324567816
first to listen and to pity the first to be admired and in his manner	 4.975902924045422
deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that	 3.6673547353647584
the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just	 3.2722448432499984
known i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain	 4.739025928106757
presumption to aspire can never take place no never mr darcy is	 3.4248888819011674
comers indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us to visit	 3.7207115929380685
goodnatured wishes for her welldoing which had proceeded before from	 4.206600745444326
to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of	 3.152490399065431
returned within the stated time seriously however she felt tolerably	 3.5390505168647355
companions all the way to longbourn elizabeth listened as little as she	 3.5095779947405865
thankful that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness	 3.2603930965073187
in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to mrs	 5.1607846297032
him	 3.051944479675148
can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it	 3.550169201088467
read it aloud said their father for i hardly know myself what it is	 3.1725435627911414
his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the	 3.954945503543945
good or evil must be done by him every idea that had been brought	 3.7459287384281987
i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william	 3.1418230402274996
they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to	 3.242219256896891
night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she	 3.665277682030261

one should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brotherinlaw and	 5.148919005299693
and immediately said	 3.589277651271925
particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our	 4.443725882032238
revived	 1.9356690691114107
shut i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness	 3.9035379013422946

pride of one who had ten thousand ayear	 3.3494445258757835
his father was an excellent man said mrs gardiner	 2.962827835672336

their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt	 3.789130440150007

that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was	 4.257371598683071
first opportunity of saying with sneering civility	 3.8200292391527504

thank you again and again for not going to the lakes how could i	 3.670536811811091
roads were all to her taste and lady catherines behaviour was most	 3.394651252491882
marry and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had	 5.061412094734865
darcys explanation by restoring bingley to all her former good	 4.356373365360939
appearance of his goodness elizabeth though she did not credit above	 4.549525517547873
approve she comes to us today i shall write again as soon as any	 3.8273704430199356
capable of engaging any womans heart with all these circumstances to	 4.210089363204679
possible claim on me in the present instance no principle of either	 4.360688665595112
even as a common flirt than she has been here the officers will find	 3.884975988473984
tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villanous	 3.261868473631472
that could be so called the respect created by the conviction of his	 4.118718479641863
at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually	 3.5735591289181055
mr bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the	 3.5075016206897964
ignorance but with me it is not so painful recollections will	 3.909841253997898
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted	 3.522315924233428
civility i am thus rejected but it is of small importance	 3.908298676579282
for the honour of seeing you here	 3.6085922566086133
entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of	 3.2812890655942493
had any conception ofits object was nothing less than to secure her	 4.277342970741659
care of her cows and her poultry elizabeth found that nothing was	 4.496373375749297
an easy distance do you call it it is nearly fifty miles	 4.241231043135558
house but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the	 3.5919219067725154
house where they were to remain a few days	 5.108480201546383
circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to	 4.2453716715833965
had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have	 3.4910319254246915
however little mr darcy might have liked such an address he contented	 3.1919813528829004
elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded	 3.579907902261745
saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother	 3.84031806173161
must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have	 3.8910946513836837
feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn	 3.63026206840831
friend would not call herself near her family under less than half	 3.2609093825742166
were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went	 4.1241294696770945
person elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though	 3.3006778343538095
of his having been to meand excepting a sorethroat and headache	 5.06919790221108
he made no answer	 2.7176047911292187
head quarters	 3.9482635268874016
own daughters i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have	 3.8927939992891156
obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour	 4.519140762995212
i certainly shall not you know how i detest it unless i am	 3.6854197974933003
she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the	 4.099904205033519
she was reading a sermon however i did not hear above one word in ten	 3.3805384651237835
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts she was not sorry however to	 4.309447459714928
so many months so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all	 3.968568450361292
their two selves only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion	 3.6693115334112036
well when she came into the room this morning her dirty petticoat	 3.5770819877677904
readily obeyed mrs gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing	 4.240540781756581
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him but i	 4.639069972753886
at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such	 3.944225246834458
have happened but it is all all too late now	 3.9435574596492176
i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a	 3.355186334487983
of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of	 3.5952664726023893
with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers it was	 5.044434666602696
lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievablethat one false	 4.6817851843233464
conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with	 3.378057726679275
money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there then shewing	 3.752053303101624
the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by	 3.169623717261824
prove what she felt	 4.025051086103209
gutenbergtm trademark and any other party distributing a project	 3.603987993563426
your daughter but would my giving you the wishedfor promise make	 3.4469122876408105
them indeed excited a lively attention the suspicions which had just	 3.988728497954407
at all like your going such a way off must it be so	 3.351535077738711
useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small	 3.277370554544833
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by	 4.0831747057537235
volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the	 4.002822484726306
several times i wonder what he can be doing there	 3.6373781447681317
party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other i hope we	 4.137524712951713
dance	 3.227874077897356
silence as either mrs hurst or miss bingley and even lydia was too	 3.5371467923228304
care of himyes i really believe darcy does take care of him in	 3.7224715323992243
youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of	 3.6970826155578584
of an hours têteàtête with mrs bennet before breakfast a	 3.384065462778598
elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by	 3.4417736424639855
she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to	 3.5069617865374196
elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how	 4.298250101266347
relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore	 4.3833286902662065
events mr wickham wrote to inform me that having finally	 3.9295974259727497
amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you	 5.15995189915286
no it would have been strange if they had but i make no doubt they	 4.086407396084331
enforced them earnestlybut however this remonstrance might have	 3.3795285497452454
feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his	 4.403242222330632
heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day and tell my dear	 3.349583800822826
receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself instead of a	 3.6662814837589814
she herself had been barbarously used by them all and on these two	 4.32722066224382
himself to strangers	 3.1110907136527697
and from his judgment information and knowledge of the world she must	 3.9198546538794066

imputed to my getting wet through yesterday my kind friends will	 3.926609113896974
the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper	 3.952301732625614
yesbut as it happens they are all of them very clever	 4.395775923809998
her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the	 3.369185063409972
fashion	 1.9356690691114107
on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at	 3.7606049106315407
astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the	 4.612333956863373
of myself but i dread other peoples remarks	 3.939733320661077
was so thoughtful	 3.657675994330372
continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the groupand i doubt	 3.878535873245268
had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him	 3.1317317265590967

i never saw such a woman i never saw such capacity and taste and	 3.2767973435788016
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the	 3.7428009050890414

editions all of which are confirmed as public domain in the us	 3.9988309394449555
my motive for cautioning you is as follows we have reason to imagine	 4.116134008329577

with a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room on	 5.1123369367191565

but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him	 3.5145970469136545
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs bennets ill humour or ill	 3.73997326568125

visit them	 3.6108695623649405
bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and	 3.7010656444938537
from netherfield and was opened immediately the envelope contained a	 4.364698361766772

succeeded no less in the real object of her civility mr darcy looked	 3.620767441785132

character there is nothing marked in its lines her teeth are	 4.723509388223666
i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you	 4.193967869361254
mr bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued	 2.5847883160365424
mr darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling	 3.247211693318245
he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth	 4.67354601841631
her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent	 3.818660043570559

accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly	 3.3505608580432393

the whole of the journey from elizabeths thoughts it was never absent	 2.893322723623836
and do you really know all this cried mrs gardiner whose curiosity	 3.1346948478563554
soon as any eligible purchase offers	 3.6694072907743123
originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome	 3.8749963697802525
good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those	 4.774365855570806
but she had no reason to fear mr and mrs gardiners curiosity it was	 3.6069390620930935
be deceived again caroline did not return my visit till yesterday	 3.0047719237511576
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise	 3.575951975433164

evenings may do a great deal	 4.04872641955219
happiness of a most beloved sister	 4.277280423769637
clothes must reflect on her daughters nuptials than to any sense of	 4.226119856875299
that is very true said elizabeth though it had not occurred to me	 3.2461240650908034
improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham and nothing less than	 3.8636932944224576
mother talked on of her dislike of mr darcy and her resolution to be	 3.5286061946686447
opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song	 4.468973468064356
i beg your pardon i will try again at present i am not in love with	 3.4454831622488182
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease	 4.330167951270511
let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way	 3.6871877949156424

why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley i am	 3.4335489099237617
to come to the point at last what made you so shy of me when you first	 3.958047502402103
of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the	 3.8334853594000116
propriety and delicacy have you not heard me say that from his	 3.4101953239856075
were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball	 3.4627172590241515
newlyborn notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of	 4.71950069512429
he must be an oddity i think said she i cannot make him	 4.609228900724507
dilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion	 3.595421386996793
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which	 4.085674189636732
afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew mr darcy though i	 3.285023603337224
their plan and would not give his real opinion about it he did not	 3.7745590425366817
objection all loveliness and goodness as she is her understanding	 4.886912906504006
possible she was more alive to the disgrace which the want of new	 5.103399175592215
the case	 3.3655524737431888
it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr bennet and	 3.4096611907628196
that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the	 3.4872198625257513
occasion for entailing estates from the female lineit was not thought	 5.648200737878479
mrs bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married and she	 3.3065612419806847
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and	 4.234083161006877
at pemberley	 3.4868402496567215
ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human	 3.7881358489865398
and her husband at longbourn as soon as they were married that he was	 3.3464525393469082
something for fortune and figure	 3.505403270060803
often applied to feelings which arise from an halfhours acquaintance	 3.474707652305598
to counterbalance these advantages mr darcy had considerable patronage	 4.263005306089383
bennet	 3.2858885633984505
though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for	 3.492759805181903
will not leave london before he has found them who is to fight wickham	 3.4868272742912088
soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last i	 3.076939417788075
i began to be afraid you would never come back again people did say	 3.4760692721318156
eldest daughter she must just mentionshe felt it incumbent on her	 3.6725305662146193

beauty entirely behind he could number the fields in every direction	 5.112859932919139
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment	 4.868146924954948
myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable	 4.819179376479754
as soon as they entered the copse lady catherine began in the following	 3.1768510404124686
her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with	 4.17329109457654
satisfaction she had promised herself it was consequently necessary to	 3.621919942249715
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology	 3.4250754853690335
done she had a less active part to play it became her turn to listen	 3.612051080902962

seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your	 3.6551163207171173

mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his	 3.140947873159664
it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your	 3.6240861901303933

dear to have given him one of your set downs i quite detest the man	 4.021067959913752

the good lady who shewed us the house did give him a most flaming	 3.5732334179342873
the compliment of such a mans affection and though her intentions did	 4.1396768837057225
you take an eager interest in that gentlemans concerns said darcy in	 4.415829738112179
blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation	 4.790961590346598
will be answered	 3.285397381860812
eveningelizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment	 3.750110720872057
in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire	 3.522895297458877
her curtsey and address to his friend	 3.543170839571534
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to	 3.2397766893278965
moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her during your	 4.022176107428838
possibility as that she could encourage him herself and her	 4.5641638017639465

to escape she added lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing	 4.395008379518856
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole	 4.616412470940198
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to	 4.17178065713223
till its success could be known likewise for though feeling almost	 3.185983361910482
good gracious mr darcyand so it does i vow well any friend of	 3.701793440511067
did not know him in the least lord how i laughed and so did mrs	 4.506974656968331
and as they drew near the appointed inn where mr bennets carriage was	 4.153727589543938
natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging there is	 6.262655126916623
went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town but	 3.679218324592001
case	 4.15560472745106
before you came back jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare	 3.436484981724945
i wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is	 3.501175287940404
of a good fortune must be in want of a wife	 3.3460890109707386
probably more than she felt for herself the carriage was sent to meet	 3.8782314442513233

imprudent as a marriage between mr wickham and our poor lydia	 3.561370830427183
outthere is something very pompous in his styleand what can he	 3.9273883483512146
and may i ask said elizabeth but the terms i suppose must be	 3.689680410652325
elizabeth coloured and saida little	 4.175575051935693
indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancingi entreat you	 4.71704859005499
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister and	 3.582935774272641
it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a	 3.9785091960818786
placed within and it was pronounced to be ready after an affectionate	 4.331629315310106

may stay a little longer mrs collins will be very glad of your	 3.8248329341888447
seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she i am	 4.110933811929735
her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met	 4.035572134707429
expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present	 4.028695319707594
not pronounce she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his	 3.581220106099791
women in the room and which he thought the prettiest and his	 5.066486906841356
you to stay two months i told mrs collins so before you came there	 3.1986781724965563
delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of	 3.3986713014348866
enough to leave her room elizabeth was glad to be taken to her	 3.652641337098674
inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such	 3.3744467048233386
present occasion and secondly of my room i shall be glad to have the	 4.536921514613324
situation he could conjecture very little about it he must go	 4.054127241296875

business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to	 3.5925520774040764
yes she did	 3.4108709690597516
to say no other apology to offer if i have wounded your sisters	 4.405455382395276
she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out she	 3.675453816293366
towards mr collins by janes introduction of him she received him with	 3.30295821076867
true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room well colonel	 4.1002060865942935
separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their	 3.885527942037064
connected with the letter he held it suddenly struck her that it might	 4.007187750111025
you must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth	 3.435313524935589
soon as he comes	 3.8736289396926145
character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had	 3.090201243492035
good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of	 4.836722967906723
i must not decide on my own performance	 4.3762818812911926
in company with either of them their society can afford no pleasure	 3.31601146710052
wanted she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery	 3.9049455752482434
mr darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching	 3.257098126315163
books	 1.9356690691114107
images of the original pages are available through	 3.7771306021421323
mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay	 3.7178753959810034
herself when her father continued	 3.6642011472263474
forwarder than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour ago	 3.2836013155177244
and lydia but while they were supported by their mothers indulgence	 3.515622759331997
when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley were	 3.7369638806029295
longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved	 3.7766200728959056
an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after	 3.5880012571792816
not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your	 4.209988330082465
way his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her	 4.486986203476505
his affection might be reanimated and the influence of his friends	 4.960599130885785
you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first	 3.348155417939853
to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false	 4.12007214853858
concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that	 3.7638007015681483
her you have a sweet room here mr bingley and a charming prospect	 4.167662429458763
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady	 3.0797553759981917
you look conscious young ladies have great penetration in such matters	 3.859235700065856
ohyou mean jane i supposebecause he danced with her twice to be	 3.3648541508575205
much entailed as ever the lucases are very artful people indeed	 3.591501219289039
where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherines curiosity	 4.009565188338814
miss bingley i think i have heard you say that you know them	 3.2013003647851423
mrs annesley is with her the others have been gone on to scarborough	 3.4043008896361147
and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty	 3.8940650713800236
was all pride and insolence	 3.133562071788821
ever since he was four years old	 3.285051671178385
on the subject	 3.26683145510559
himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain	 3.7089038240594614
business in london	 3.645959533847736
a hope of wickhams meaning to marry her no one but jane she thought	 3.659117277967178
sight	 4.294425223904065
enough happened in the time good gracious when i went away i am sure	 3.544050989821278
webbs all play and their father has not so good an income as	 3.3974530485949197
sake of what had been rather than what was charlottes first letters	 3.63365698567364
could not approve him nor could she for a moment repent her refusal or	 4.024726993361629
after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a	 4.722700201607772
till next week you would probably do it you would probably not	 3.556836787576088
attention the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire lest she	 3.857202403250488
match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too	 6.295888877266538
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock	 3.037782060567051
intended	 4.216721688721115
society she was of course carefully kept and though mrs wickham	 3.68786671493606
render mr darcys conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a	 3.143809736208956
coming here i had no notion but he would go a shooting or something or	 4.187715589487285
exceedingly as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its	 4.102285574948912
wellinformed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was	 3.937781260398855
was surprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme	 3.6387738444730213
in darcys breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her	 3.424535121629663
his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his	 3.4949875777424397
springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the	 3.7689699548111135

my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly	 3.142640870128541
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty but if	 4.334589880497319
even wish for any renewal of his attentions his character sunk on every	 4.190417490748073

soon as she possibly could she was no sooner in possession of it than	 5.051264628788023
once from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day	 4.0627548419367345
her stay as they had been at first the very last evening was spent	 4.077799466694527
his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride	 4.194645601988476
the marriage of her sisters he bore with philosophy the conviction that	 4.334569230015653
was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she	 4.4217458332721264
will be satisfied with what i have done i am not romantic you know i	 4.219362692706382
are they indeed cried elizabeth with the greatest satisfaction	 3.8778396705027003
he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a	 4.052403970305256
something very much to the purpose of course he begins with	 3.932724245689411
liability to you for damages costs and expenses including legal	 3.273873339837113
information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting	 3.402485470340312
gloomy elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it her power	 3.1663582802619485
you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and	 3.209051292432322
inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man	 3.8506144390463777
certainly did not hate him no hatred had vanished long ago and she	 4.449209681951355
name to her mother on her ladyships entrance though no request of	 3.5508443578522617
discredit and misery my child let me not have the grief of seeing	 3.8606225268884
domestic happiness were overthrown but mr bennet was not of a	 3.4628686906831114
not tell	 3.9876565345635018
i must find mr gardiner this moment on business that cannot be	 3.074626644758968
things said than i am going to say but he is an ugly fellow i am glad	 4.747882285431967
each to be dwelt on farther	 5.167301812792856
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family mrs	 4.41887280044288
doing very well together your tempers are by no means unlike you are	 3.593839985373008
the use of project gutenbergtm works calculated using the method	 3.950022921192996
when at length they arose to take leave mrs bennet was most pressingly	 4.05923330164251
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad	 5.090447704029896
which she could not praise the house furniture neighbourhood and	 3.254670517929171
to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there	 4.230214087386577
kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove no	 3.737402207828282
pemberley property he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy a most	 3.858688429635183
to him with a most sincere regard and she parted from him convinced	 3.7372542700744473
you may well warn me against such an evil human nature is so prone to	 3.161163708092314
imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other	 4.668963369567554
wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with	 3.999782808298522
with the housekeepers room	 3.993251923340016
appeared dissatisfied on the strength of darcys regard bingley had the	 4.32088128905616
countenance expressed real security such a circumstance could only	 3.8161569063244367
varied however her determination never did	 3.4979608580766732
it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your	 3.6459805550631668
casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr darcy	 3.6723382231399806
door jane was at a drawingroom window watching their arrival when	 3.514470429313993
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed	 3.1863791462175346
you are mistaken i write rather slowly	 2.746561118472317
mrs collins well	 3.465138595510819
i am dear sir c c	 3.076199568689179
uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off by	 4.058854859430676
give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other	 4.02651802834844
the evening because you are in each others confidence and have secret	 3.4468546005384644
not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their	 4.161811683382074
from herself to janefrom jane to bingley her thoughts were in a line	 4.078446729091195
the diningparlour she then joined them soon enough to see lydia with	 3.5315316968321957
greatest share the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had	 4.639017327694835
from any return of mr collinss addresses by engaging them towards	 4.079164851389815
of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children	 4.124041787466605
would judge differently in the affair	 4.750308753409365
together but enough of this you alluded to something else you	 3.508936982383354
there is such a sight to be seen i will not tell you what it is make	 3.936512942400651
she urged jane to borrow mr bingleys carriage immediately and at	 3.8451634136466386
there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those	 3.880039469987399
delighted the rain continued the whole evening without intermission	 3.4869416088210263
if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it	 3.4512383994012175
disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to	 4.434291871437552
they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i	 5.497590922857227
elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and	 4.525169478737602
altered a creature that when she went away i was perfectly	 3.454677112297269
society i own is necessary to me i have been a disappointed man and	 3.826663542070071
seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year his	 3.2478948862677623
and what is your success	 3.4710081886044426
it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now	 4.327280833165272
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the	 4.63315600510335
little and mr hurst nothing at all the former was divided between	 3.9574098905351494
unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful	 3.5391923965530006
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper written	 4.373727279967287
but so we all do it is only that he has better means of having it than	 3.321333644010007
this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss	 3.2640386936082515

in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to	 4.841460654264701
bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and	 3.5540246444333254

mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise	 3.4065452811653256
disconcerted she could not imagine what business he could have in town	 3.3939828416667326
connections and pride	 3.769853478794105
as she allowed him to speak you either chuse this method of passing	 3.3389131079791476
honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on	 3.4507226584486608
on their way to town and without any intention of coming back again	 3.5017338974147845

of whom does jane ever think ill and who is there whatever might be	 3.288877459900679
up to him as a superior your lively talents would place you in the	 3.445414838461132
find it not equal to lydias for him she had scarcely needed her	 3.7408755512876013
and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of	 3.3362072954334794
london georgianas reception of them was very civil but attended with	 4.72857730595346
oh my dear brother replied mrs bennet that is exactly what i	 2.8841294472229793
will probably be of some duration	 3.687288208813732
the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding	 3.9545483569786324
did not expect such a compliment	 3.191746758980721
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday senight	 3.9397272108183894
he shook his headi wish i could call her amiable it gives me pain	 3.720362114805085

answered her hopes but alas the ladies had crowded round the table	 3.6173716290385793
there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if	 4.2587252846619235

only of you	 3.770747206519209
however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet	 4.852435032861533
when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley	 3.607014743098659
which soon brought to her recollection that mr darcys explanation	 3.1952830820063753

jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern she knew but little	 3.043953498637402
felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as	 4.007469432680595
yesterday	 1.9356690691114107
oh said lydia stoutly i am not afraid for though i am the	 4.247268171421896
not err but when she read and reread with the closest attention the	 4.327960714765564
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr darcy had been was much	 4.172026935882611
was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the	 4.433870266663489
compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing	 3.6933845979528335
oh noit is not for me to be driven away by mr darcy if he	 4.3378356688357025
being in kent they contained no actual complaint nor was there any	 3.951420309423562

told me all about it	 3.5898718023755882
of shame that she could hardly keep her seat it drew from her	 3.609952140025329
frequent discussion between her parents elizabeth saw directly that her	 3.750092922379619
i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for	 2.8401073525829896
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give	 3.7264905976339215
manner	 3.31962613857949
she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her putting	 3.0540229089931707
circumstances	 4.150912001900039
determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy but	 4.709812691112447

done to his presentation at st jamess	 4.2365583943629375
freely i can recal nothing worse but the fact is that we are very	 3.5124830838579095
story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a	 4.292347195151269
with his friend	 3.1481097237077345
my dear mr bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome you	 3.1862041045880907

this half hour and master has had a letter	 3.2278724179142264
you shall hear thenbut prepare yourself for something very dreadful	 3.044479993976953
civilities bingley was the principal spokesman and miss bennet the	 3.8943809251606587
grounds are delightful they have some of the finest woods in the	 3.6682475099514575
occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man	 5.0512905570510735

that	 3.3289478076959305
design nonsense how can you talk so but it is very likely that he	 3.920460105516672
her husband might then have rested in its proper place	 3.3556629377245693
who do not cherish a feeling of selfcomplacency on the score of some	 4.0143780483126585
did as the day of his arrival drew near	 3.6036983844324095
ever to pay him	 3.619273449402739
manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it	 5.188529643409293
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had	 4.711314418990762
hurst had a house the next was in these words i do not pretend to	 3.5247918277563666
suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his	 3.3862848876028218
there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliams manners	 4.42961435433995
he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when	 3.4883261585560135
gone my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have	 3.988006602968117
scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under	 4.443132778197535
he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of	 3.6128776091625285
happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant farm	 4.12039684511955
likewise turned towards mr darcy with an expression of halflaughing	 3.688565106242729
and now we are better	 3.8402721945005895
campand from her correspondence with her sister there was still less	 3.8858076194855173
license terms from this work or any files containing a part of this	 4.459334010801627
that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive	 2.958280163149262
and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved	 4.325211580194865
she was at least free from the offence of mr darcys farther notice	 4.269958319376194
colour and shape and the eyelashes so remarkably fine might be	 4.978659106028441
both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great	 3.934222680673962
four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge	 4.1933963354047075
behind you and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the	 3.673728598230094
no lizzy that is what i do not choose i should be sorry you know	 4.473347056889172
that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed	 3.6693999163652564
splendor and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings	 3.973744579997729
the want of importance in his friends connections than from their want	 3.460056491616765
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a	 4.091631477471224
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value	 3.100824643461773
i have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him	 3.8463773739131213
elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for	 3.5811735746942945
on her she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of	 3.561302733367094
observed in them for ever	 3.456329848419903
go the next day for a short time	 3.8504545299425224

well jane who is it from what is it about what does he say well	 3.4040235044268274
for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure	 3.43275606796631
animated mrs collins knew not what to make of him colonel	 3.118794839177629
of happiness but it was not to be did you ever hear darcy mention the	 3.60431747689192
not all that mrs bennet however with the assistance of her five	 3.4469886898419664
his easy temper or her affectionate heart the darling wish of his	 3.217504808843964
called during her absence mr darcy only for a few minutes to take	 3.4806064910965095
she shook her head i do not get on at all i hear such different	 3.968070427596035
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their	 3.6105612879041034
ached acutely elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were	 4.214930779050538
for an answer mrs bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was	 3.6396826032619862
that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his	 4.4448644711583665
to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her	 3.6488840615007896
and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given	 4.529130359087621
bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to	 3.76120609673058

the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning and mr collins having	 3.5039689871254076
kitty who took all these threats in a serious light began to cry	 4.017947950708951
blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that	 3.5017244350081933
must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music	 3.4795949312333296
gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyships carriage was	 4.1555656577172275
she can have her own waybut i tell you what miss lizzy if you take	 3.7886687302171347
in what an amiable light does this place him thought elizabeth	 3.2610913817284968
she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on	 4.632798998691932
there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel	 2.589378781672732
i did not think you wouldand that being the case i cannot consider	 3.5093771131869462
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most	 5.202215855765802
take care lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointment	 4.1448657856945115
along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton	 3.2110298073560215
she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslin and	 4.288869785409655
as these but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the	 4.011621096338642

my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i	 3.5921603324988167
brought up by him at his own expencehe is now gone into the army	 3.46513984294661
with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many	 3.2409765439500315
near so much like a ball	 3.640552503798624
for the night and mrs bennet with great politeness and cordiality said	 3.4536023947709418
of mr collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london	 3.647615822968787
boast and so fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to	 4.14503411563818
the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her	 3.948659658711777
with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike	 3.593313561819771
intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every	 3.8506299498293313
she supposed if he meant any thing he must mean an allusion to what	 3.7613268729672282
and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very	 4.3026542510604
trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the	 4.510738341554502
particular allowing for the common demands of the game mr wickham was	 5.20246606183327
though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much	 4.821767703578374
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care	 5.456615806486394
wonder at her being where she was	 3.4559581962539156
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth	 3.603445047901395
father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these	 3.2911390677754397
imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love	 3.795454673073622
at length the parsonage was discernible the garden sloping to the road	 3.4949667151729504
lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or	 3.786152469451414
beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much	 4.4365410733177635

him it is because he will not give himself the trouble	 3.2554677364615183
advantage for having a couple ofor i may say three very silly	 4.606279085448036
here when you sent for uswas it so	 3.496124041735766
himself was no very difficult point to persuade him against	 3.3337320780821393
regret that he came	 3.5465059887880352
cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you	 3.739715116112422
yes my youngest is not sixteen perhaps she is full young to be much	 3.5415484308649465
and warmth remained for bingleys salutation he was full of joy and	 3.3318356811547014
done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and	 3.8944669722648277
for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth	 4.87842697998866
did not you think mr darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well	 3.621355949143681
but i was embarrassed	 3.5643862449014336
effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications as i must	 4.393858978125336
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she	 3.1561402708076556
appear to the greatest advantage in walkingif the first i should be	 4.548739657981429
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room she wished she	 3.4529812452291884
avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce he had	 4.6884953927991
greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were	 4.302669107436026
yoursdo you draw	 2.9791723338223934
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him in	 4.369752629384159
thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate she put down the	 3.53263063177938
mrs philipss supper party but his manners recommended him to every	 4.031323610156316
she looked and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with	 3.487857600640709
to others as in his reproaches to myself after this period every	 4.55014988228471
full of both i know you will do him such ample justice that i am	 3.744988220475113
with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her	 4.81797730891635
affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into	 4.262631302464487
next day you will give your motherinlaw a few hints when this	 4.28425374724774
i shall be very fit to see janewhich is all i want	 4.745079937590075
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for	 4.523432876450104
let me call your maid is there nothing you could take to give you	 3.4008646277657344
as she pronounced these words mr darcy changed colour but the emotion	 4.084148067588086
to her mother and kitty but her letters were always long expected and	 3.4425898044489207
abovementioned and while mr darcy was attending them to their	 3.659058083197295
had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her	 3.5789205834103384
to him oh how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation	 3.503701865175048
compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings	 4.14814082914758
our dear bingley what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always	 3.7205919730098946
delayed a little longer and mr collinss proposal accepted with as	 3.338592465867206
jane was so admired nothing could be like it every body said how well	 3.685272868033297
their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing	 3.899026831431049
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the	 4.209640364859612
him better when they met in kent than before and that she had never	 3.813291385359269
assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth	 5.293465598196856
with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel	 4.948229068217399
a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant	 3.227327078004374
mr bingley was good looking and gentlemanlike he had a pleasant	 4.288558608216997
yes sir but i do not know when that will be i do not know who is	 3.282103710693221
each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so	 3.8159426344255745
been but little assisted by education or society the greatest part of	 4.213408784456348
while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different	 3.75373882386834
pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs	 3.9658144328232465
and distributed to anyone in the united states without paying any fees	 3.8524046035836257
hopes of mr bingleys heart were entertained	 4.185204302508419
nothing and i will not be sent on a fools errand again	 4.786545242643323
hearing the very best performers on miss lucass persevering however	 3.6582876906951634
you provide in accordance with paragraph 1f3 a full refund of any	 4.299525328017387
known sir williams too long he could tell her nothing new of the	 3.3297422678583404
but did not live to do itmr bingley intended it likewise and	 3.3274988007146797
have somebody who thinks of those things where shall you change	 3.702600315787071
aye no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had	 4.353881400027591
with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms darcy	 3.204737806943946
edged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being mr	 5.232783981406572
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery	 3.501768068603599
and she rose as she spoke lady catherine rose also and they turned	 3.4019170939572865
his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as	 3.2798490757323964
your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned	 3.9072885837621025
pressing entreaties that they would come in and even in spite of mrs	 3.883613657365814
above her ancles in dirt and alone quite alone what could she mean by	 3.937892323882517
posted on the official project gutenbergtm web site <URL>	 3.7722234037462283
and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as	 3.075039708998967
complaisancebut in vain mary would not understand them such an	 2.8720909589311607
the children but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the	 4.052145885036752
it will be her turn soon to be teazed said miss lucas i am going	 4.403536458026504
miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to	 3.5047573633044915
chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of	 2.855155207176931
when her mother went up to her dressingroom at night she followed her	 4.022727612741543
for she loves to be of use but tell me what did you come down to	 3.98729114549808
requited their taking her home and affording her their personal	 3.8412677685294025
thereupon but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend	 3.995192333758431
for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as	 4.5974328639135305
catherines unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of	 4.890275599812262
miss elizabeth bennet	 3.4249987643288815
all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs	 2.836414161712987
when the teathings were removed and the card tables placed the ladies	 5.163567325242808
would come in time	 3.160801355957512
the servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathless an	 4.333444528088121
partiality when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my	 4.34787299229721
united volubility in lydias imagination a visit to brighton comprised	 3.6109149480713434
your engagement	 3.838277764891259
saying	 3.995218494815012
her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than	 4.496226114592492
an ensign	 2.8421739221132025
very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds	 3.309022225938574
well my dear said mr bennet when elizabeth had read the note	 3.226506202789197
i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be	 3.49613348784851
good heaven can it be really so yet now i must believe you cried	 3.1987913108686725
mr darcy took her advice and did finish his letter	 3.158254675264286
that he crouded his cousins had more to say than he could well manage	 3.6353622175954645
london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the	 3.0577771928234263
introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in	 3.5360523179785526
upon without some help any place would do of about three or four	 3.0351024545155614
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would	 3.8250704725564297
rather offended and therefore checked her laugh miss bingley warmly	 3.441135739738756
perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any	 3.2574464160966667
this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree i	 3.7546464907944057
because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement	 3.929358415491059
affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive	 4.032567947216522
but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had	 4.1432799584729985
after this day jane said no more of her indifference not a word passed	 3.8640782778028253
slowly towards the house	 2.9217013185178455
had allowed her to apply i am confident that she would have performed	 4.721451678754454
and what did she say	 3.4011860500258235
mr darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was	 3.601757335783751
things you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us we	 4.321749957782547
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round	 4.336558666038443
tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and	 3.6354589139727387
bingleys large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their	 3.3784640533297865
assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amendsbut	 4.432382648850064
along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was	 3.971378429487043
and when immediately before my fathers death mr darcy gave him a	 3.6969684559364757
there had appeared very insufficient and she read it again widely	 4.341923496738325
believed it possible	 3.5779696313976728
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune	 3.052353984633739
bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to	 3.461142232974248
as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she	 3.6326128291478645
help reverting once more to the first and saying	 3.742353223468234
just done to give pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a liking to the	 3.705711708367786
very amiable but charlottes kindness extended farther than elizabeth	 3.121555962552286
ah sir i do indeed it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you	 3.8323986605133347
two daughters married and the man whom she could not bear to speak of	 4.169957046148059
would perhaps be called resentfulmy good opinion once lost is lost	 3.3724960333249108
and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he	 3.410930703707748
moment or are the result of previous study	 3.6051462873146023
were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with	 3.6907053433239647
doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady	 3.997705763879696
miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cards she is a great	 3.9222545197599907
report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to	 3.4067086804792774
coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again	 4.757511951607938
success she expected he was resolutely silent however and from a	 4.129427880399635
tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she	 3.5095788914739123
minutes my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in	 3.1326261453078375
was his neighbour till sir william thus began	 3.7694027301922075

sisterinlaw was sure he would make her an offer before we came away	 3.156568396748244
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions	 4.071937601383383
far as i thought myself privileged for you i shall send this by	 3.727829857846827
elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the	 4.610224407929667
however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor	 3.887281518424974
janes delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to	 3.577830775069953
with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to	 3.566781734856029
he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle	 5.290800799818051

encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered	 3.7193834858887267
soon afterwards ordered her carriage upon this signal the youngest of	 3.5002179074021385
allowances and urged the possibility of mistakesbut by everybody else	 4.070781030637643

could at all forgive their daughter	 4.32027987581101
subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for	 4.258686979268418
in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of	 3.7054825010212107
unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her	 3.281624024644211
him i had not thought so very ill of himi had supposed him to be	 3.865689775555151
thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think	 5.3779001164882425
and in the evening mrs bennets invention was again at work to get	 3.7446478342898883

elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down	 2.9425710363293662

mr wickhams attention was caught and after observing mr collins for	 4.391469012897223

whatever my connections may be said elizabeth if your nephew does	 3.4833855596065195

poor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his	 3.5285915963549157
they last changed horses see the postilions and try if any thing could	 4.063266404432807

say you to the day i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well	 3.539924242187435
of what might be called economy in her own private expences she	 4.066665622533445
admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard	 3.9937624751605014

magnitude you last night laid to my charge the first mentioned	 3.524631979132941
such a risk but against this there were objections and she finally	 3.414201650927327

when this information was given and they had all taken their seats mr	 3.469243866459268
her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal	 4.189315947595269
my dear sir replied mr collins i am particularly obliged to you	 3.3736888151228714
pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they	 4.245097100606809

absolutely settled you will have a charming motherinlaw indeed and	 3.9332480366507765
janei certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her	 3.3094455241892247

not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character	 4.193813176469637
i do i do like him she replied with tears in her eyes i love him	 3.865681868578143
his attachment excited gratitude his general character respect but she	 3.2044006596312986
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very	 3.3761441633319134
unconnected with his general powers about ten or a dozen years ago	 3.224204697673836
mr collins was punctual to his time and was received with great	 3.962289380344077
but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus	 4.273361144379806
triumph the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of	 3.5355520766610646
who i shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the	 3.7538402453416144

nothing of that who should suffer but myself it has been my own doing	 3.46991410601549

catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to	 3.704472792971627
oh certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity we will	 3.4460784723843623
i give to hear your strictures on them	 3.4489849562371004
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane but she would not	 4.549299940368891
without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing	 3.1067942004778235
be made out from them his principal object must be to discover the	 3.4349527662885504
to me again by letter for the presentation his circumstances he	 3.832198433808096
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent	 5.322158352840837
the evening and might now come to enquire particularly after her but	 3.251729921120697
when i am in town it is pretty much the same they have each their	 3.0394001165426605
to be always so guarded and circumspect it is very often nothing but	 5.255910287975862
him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not to believe	 4.464446095893158
a friendly eye	 3.6957584605578355
when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having	 3.7023370513816345
done	 3.7481352097926295
book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a	 5.144536230692506
was never alluded to but as no such delicacy restrained her mother an	 4.820669791310762
affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in	 3.258877129033224
own judgment of her situation the note was immediately dispatched and	 4.072252882538703
that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged she would not	 4.1239042107216335
strong inducement his revenge would have been complete indeed	 5.470789506530468
forster say had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement	 4.242885457184625
catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a	 3.9644700517759617
aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused	 3.2413417677285223
i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong	 3.523855221584892
her eyes envied every one to whom he spoke had scarcely patience	 3.3740392951895526
he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being	 4.729729377427556
shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday	 3.9790309693889787
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i	 4.126182515324021
his cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear	 3.7128172361855842
afterwards visited mrs bingley and talked of mrs darcy may be guessed	 3.2850499917121376
permission and without paying copyright royalties special rules	 4.135615244254943
aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if	 4.420922768531235
that is all very proper and civil i am sure said mrs bennet and i	 3.717155787671063
you	 3.1576999430409995
i do not know mrs bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to	 3.3655034532712484
himintimate as you are you must know how it is to be done	 3.667455095786112
that she had no disinclination for it	 3.897640394591235
regained her composure and calmly replied	 3.1908661374729195
i am afraid mr darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper	 3.026436753789481
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the	 4.55421027676575
creating the works from public domain print editions means that no	 3.736343872322239
within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so	 3.786246592782387
away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and mrs	 3.735291425278814
turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated	 4.0490607953077005
chapter xxiii	 1.9302842045940272
seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choicea sacrifice to	 3.697177362697591
thank you said lydia for if you did i should certainly tell you	 3.462518809416364
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the	 4.984022543027377
by the author of sense and sensibility	 2.874095694252938
it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he	 4.656109069603025
she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her	 3.431259327651534
the young ladies mrs collins i am glad it occurred to me to mention	 4.113879359050521
she had heard and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it	 3.8817377865069207
dreadful bitterness of spirit	 3.2931258635123073
too long and too well to be a fair judge it is impossible for me to	 4.0107863487775175
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him their eyes	 4.176982770373358
assertion of her brothers being partial to miss darcy she paid no	 3.669059877086464
how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr darcy	 3.4410866338215387
wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much	 3.2520227628691276
have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the	 3.770282040264376
the kingdom he promises fairly and i hope among different people	 5.268019557917315
scheme of infamy my poor father how he must have felt it	 3.9781419668053077
wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the	 4.288898445706924
do	 3.446055773906049
was to leave meryton in a week or fortnights time as that was the	 3.4991020761662517
opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost his affection was	 3.346531295141079
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared	 3.490375462560084
with astonishment and disdain i wonder you took the trouble of coming	 3.9959693543872947
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr gardiner after	 3.5676385364198566
yours sincerely c	 3.496282560949735
the whole of the matter secondly she was very sure that mr collins	 4.353931843356441
would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy and with regard to the	 4.011106283185674
resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her	 4.633608290320151
agreeable or otherwise i am not qualified to form one i have known him	 3.866589328086849
but of this answer lydia heard not a word she seldom listened to any	 3.296212370081404
are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all	 4.40569212138349
i am sure i know none so handsome but in the gallery up stairs you	 3.2777907265369937
her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their	 3.476728684839721
family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and	 4.399823836299181
expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of	 4.2845490701063165
created	 1.9356690691114107
her was amazingbut to speak with such civility to enquire after her	 3.7871711364764535
greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her	 4.7624209718259705

circumspection of all his sisters falsehood and contrivance the	 4.345381528485235
already there for the winter i wish i could hear that you my dearest	 3.6913890157650098

for one of youand indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i	 3.836667477794359
circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther	 3.3452749663981747
engaged to mr collins my dear charlotteimpossible	 3.82651074326545
with my mother up stairs she will be down in a moment i dare say	 3.9144093569195917
nor can i find there was any intention of being so but if you are	 3.561899586039826
only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his	 3.548277202940612

<NUMBER> to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt	 4.17234844787405
mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men	 4.084023991950585
be as light as a feather	 3.431185472566953
they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the	 3.639055828073996
this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can	 3.570511826070685
by the author of sense and sensibility	 2.874095694252938
i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth i am	 3.1821213517647013
liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant	 3.676259221102034

philips first brought her the news well so much the better not that	 3.449697025658258

while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the	 3.6015342642447687
oh yesof that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt poor	 3.136766816017243
him as now when all love must be vain	 3.337009484703498
lessening the honour of my cousins triumph very sadly	 3.4338715950820062
and this is your real opinion this is your final resolve very well i	 3.836941397472119
kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry	 3.324014853665962
last incumbrance of mystery and then said she if that very	 4.755060572582031
for the indulgence of some music miss bingley moved with alacrity to	 4.5709132731680375
their reception at home was most kind mrs bennet rejoiced to see jane	 4.139221169474569

she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the	 3.701602684978855
miss bingleys eyes were instantly turned towards darcy and she had	 3.169844708685518
by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not	 3.1198559310595853
her father lifted up his eyes jane was distressed elizabeth looked	 3.52828944806625
as handsome as any of them mr bingley might like you the best of the	 3.579977473788725
she is a great fool for going away if she liked him	 3.1713785818827436
brotherbecause he does not write with ease he studies too much for	 3.6108253822074006
particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him	 3.8825113038368153
his mind was visible in every feature he was struggling for the	 5.232541763383014
he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down	 3.446939127557463

he put his letter into her hand she knew not what to think nor how to	 3.280154948612961
mr collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed	 4.481230212475471
join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but	 4.593815265241845
no but it must be done soon	 3.8882952208784647

it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood	 3.726168662771177
elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed	 4.19322120231179
of which the time alone could be undecided from that moment i	 3.850850022734286

shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked	 3.3427819760515094

voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for	 4.113019745765827
respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of	 3.3243849927154057
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse	 3.343570683664732

imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to	 3.925504483162751
here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know	 3.7316032806358623
that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely	 3.6116859941896426
and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him	 3.711154359806291
darcys character though he had assured her that respect for the	 3.643541092407888

for any thing more lady catherine will not think the worse of you for	 3.6316160559887023
this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour	 4.942617565391702
mr collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had	 4.223796054976709
she had herself endured on a similar occasion five and twenty years	 3.40724097785891
any body as he has done by poor wickham he has not an illnatured	 3.605450405265989
accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as i am	 3.5693395481341925

lucases i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says	 4.2841303695800805
bingley was uncivil to her and more teazing than usual to himself	 4.467479003399419
uncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little change	 4.2562010346017205
pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of	 3.5986039959891767
oh it is of no consequence i shall see her in january but do you	 3.9867831027521436
suiting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at	 3.7335703868958037

longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own	 3.9944832220153312
she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had	 5.024472929116441

his misfortunes repeated darcy contemptuously yes his misfortunes	 3.0519688820959474

her turn was coming soon mrs bennet could not give her consent or	 3.2926385130795897
impatiently met her at the door of the dressingroom to ask why lady	 4.910548499299679

i learnt to my own family had his character been known this could not	 3.492182923408041
though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the	 4.835593596928595
as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than	 3.2530821849905207
disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of	 3.664677117582079

the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one	 3.252729783847112

while	 3.6810705187778185
you mean to frighten me mr darcy by coming in all this state to hear	 3.9691010157504185
they had never seen before of most gentlemanlike appearance walking	 3.1718919955700273

spelling and hyphen changes have been made so that there is consistency	 3.830088057947054
be seen the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable	 4.075316145709382
now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly	 3.3990610697499277
absolutely resolved on remaining where she was she cared for none	 4.555476910131396
mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has	 3.4459182702586713
acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her	 3.7226687036952724
connexion was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so	 3.980538825189663
him he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very	 3.4260363348764336
miss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she	 4.38468667138976
she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued	 3.7811428944265066
i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind your	 4.3402672619662885
between the two gentlemen but though jane would have defended either or	 3.7510876012871903
he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it	 3.547404226469605
almost a week after the gentlemens arrival that they were honoured by	 4.0167890017598955
this is an evening of wonders indeed and so darcy did every thing	 3.34380664877807
then flow in i appeal to mr darcybut let me not interrupt you	 4.721577346988466
referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam	 3.434986139902511
in a few days mr bingley returned mr bennets visit and sat about ten	 2.920377647452817
amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds	 3.311275526532823
and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without	 3.958500872550111
situation and his expectation of a young olivebranch but lizzy you	 3.699155875984962
us whether it is like or not	 3.3686364951840915
they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth	 3.5294918771142743
which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open	 3.7177829532581423
increased by every review of it that she should receive an offer of	 3.675421152012705
first got abroad it hastened his journey	 4.287387270472513
purport of his letter was to inform them that mr wickham had resolved	 4.064178833031224
conversation which had been passing while mr and mrs gardiner were	 3.924431489789788
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley	 3.738284138121237
oh yes said elizabeth drilymr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr	 3.6857789447325686
themselves what a contrast between him and his friend mr darcy danced	 4.035463324922361
in the first place replied mr gardiner there is no absolute proof	 3.500250731660403
pleasantest preservative from want this preservative she had now	 4.23499356005628
handsome thought upon the whole i am much pleased with him	 3.554612312402772
elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to	 3.9007393346739465
it is nothing in comparison of rosings my lady i dare say but i	 3.102209797652292
arrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her dressingroom window	 4.308994916215608
other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did	 3.6230279340236096
desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of	 3.9036202733024745
entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he	 3.639542293714074
conviction as truly as i wished it in reasonmy objections to	 3.987284717472725
them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the	 4.803934523700887
more than he did himself	 3.5729698637519136
to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse	 4.261569176821397
this was a lucky recollectionit saved her from something like regret	 4.076445783649673
such a fuss i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put	 3.878335214628513
such an evil	 3.790426379508261
asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as	 3.7655546859277673

produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sisters	 3.722628481663139

officers names and connections their lodgings were not long a secret	 3.4483574695561754
some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it	 3.9803850681760085
nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself as to	 3.515972866768633

during their walk it was resolved that mr bennets consent should be	 3.3040079878549333
in general satisfactory mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor	 4.1289910204777325
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware	 4.053285456230078

which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your	 4.582883052152218
of shame was severe the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly	 3.43807892138362
form any alternate format must include the full project gutenbergtm	 3.843535249034066
otherwise if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or	 4.349660330059804

collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of	 3.870668201189697
she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses	 3.716170459592146

for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in	 3.9977829139514562
to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of	 3.2905056986512795
of them good for any thing take your choice but you must be satisfied	 3.652066867727801
ease cannot write ill	 3.5659628187024266

that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth	 3.2690655923122454
admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did but	 4.098637193606078
from what we have seen of him continued mrs gardiner i really	 3.3355332507000126
her hopes as her fears and after talking with her in this manner till	 4.785526693074312
if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to	 3.5119617573581907

i never want to see him again but however he is very welcome to	 3.7422937026351595
acquaintance the subjection in which his father had brought him up had	 4.126147984458983
dared not lift up her eyes how mr darcy looked therefore she could	 3.574215732706308
remember eliza that he does not know janes disposition as you do	 3.7498144230196218

something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of	 3.6239375066158654

seeing him in unguarded moments which mr darcy could not have	 3.808018228685863
equal therefore to address mr bingley on the subject of the ball and	 3.6268233317727576
william collins	 3.9229520416833283

not depend on her serving you	 4.043775229300784

should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters	 3.4301368411091704
she grew absolutely ashamed of herselfof neither darcy nor wickham	 2.948680318593519
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do had elizabeth	 3.7038271191997443
understanding darcy was the superior bingley was by no means deficient	 3.2003691106695378
might arise unpleasant to more than myself	 4.479244289801162
no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to	 3.6290190579720467

the will of others my courage always rises with every attempt to	 3.0255928469335687
better that one only of the household and the one whom they could	 4.512886872573207

of her feelings on this developement while the contents of the first	 3.9353161794419944

will do the business	 3.9544287904146134
she made no answer	 3.0986621554174523
your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you	 4.035649053878073
jane had written the direction remarkably ill	 4.608327756920281
elizabeths anger against him had been long done away but had she	 3.451674965386571
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by	 3.214699351749345
themselves and meanly of others they were of a respectable family in	 5.092660236632328
consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her	 3.149885244593358
stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppicewood which bordered	 3.8887653316685746
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them	 4.648237801248468

all took place miss bingleys civility to elizabeth increased at last	 3.3735116120219484
ideas that he was not a goodtempered man had been her firmest	 5.207434801225997
where is your sash my dear	 3.718792862002966

with anyone for forty years he produced and distributed project	 3.8352672989724677
kept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went	 4.570102149158905
lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my room	 3.203545047247993
that i have never been much in love for had i really experienced that	 4.025005021763339
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth	 3.363207252100463
mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during	 3.1500080360239857
1e8 you may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing	 3.6311113346473323

expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere	 4.146058827250895
little to fix the attention of a stranger elizabeth walked on in quest	 3.695209546412873
oh yesthey left brighton together on sunday night and were traced	 3.119987956848259
understanding to ridicule	 3.724071361515258
character and ideas between us we seem to have been designed for each	 3.710157018058513
believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this	 3.9058568246948253
other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it	 4.411303767486313
indeed mr collins all praise of me will be unnecessary you must	 3.6474614564357224
placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find	 3.760089199138828
listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away	 4.379685855887338
inferior to what elizabeth felt	 3.3409585479198753
and is this all cried elizabeth i expected at least that the pigs	 3.3391645767294595

their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of	 3.0086179794198893
fathers life time	 3.7069532230705526
jane certainly could not come back	 3.207388902277666
fitzwilliam i should like to know how he behaves among strangers	 3.885932301365059
darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet	 3.0661323129062588
she answered him with cold civility he sat down for a few moments and	 3.4297738390885217
charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and	 3.499349783507037
while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we	 4.234956209379959
catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but lydia with perfect	 4.291407745078467
which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be	 4.714976510634094
i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr	 3.7140134949567813
tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of	 3.731865299131357
take his guest into the drawingroom again and when tea was over glad	 3.807395334718286
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and	 3.809409026228045
own future property the dinner too in its turn was highly admired and	 3.2812126046971426
conceal your age	 3.5720399336980226
being at home again in a day or two jane was already so much recovered	 3.27663194842629
mr darcy is not to be laughed at cried elizabeth that is an	 3.7094293142652233
such splendid expectations he had rather hoped that all his wifes	 4.376748788827583
it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose	 2.9801894783814076
lady catherine seemed pleased	 2.8651540785151504
result from the success of his endeavours and when even the	 3.910814396980735
intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea	 5.6074041509572154
surprise the greater when i write to them and sign my name lydia	 3.6661409537015395
taking different positions but from every window there were beauties to	 3.4464415845883063

mean to be unhappy about him	 3.3111582495690826
after amusing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explained	 3.073169246305051
such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once no	 3.2636872649118045
rather louder than any other persons was enumerating the various	 4.136592076446536

walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word	 3.1706583089469906
the tumult of elizabeths mind was allayed by this conversation she had	 4.164075661933808
him so think it no harm to be off you need not send them word at	 4.010409284144569
by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may	 4.348608202467954
intimate confidential friend mr darcy often acknowledged himself to	 3.7540036765311364
i am afraid you do not like your pen let me mend it for you i mend	 3.567763400493755
this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her	 3.201318798253989
not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever	 3.6521971684064876

people in all walks of life	 4.022127629507856
not rest till i knew the particulars let me thank you again and again	 2.91363599381439

elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the	 5.114922239814886

loud that any body might have heard us ten miles off	 3.2477322930874584
you have said quite enough madam i perfectly comprehend your	 2.9084840351709613
claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could	 4.7046006035679415
you shall not deceive me i know it to be impossible	 3.773028703443538
also more intelligible	 3.674342549904789
jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail	 4.20487430409402
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting	 3.0305497866284754

sir you quite misunderstand me said mrs bennet alarmed lizzy is	 4.370925448700365

nowhy should he if it was not allowable for him to gain my	 4.810430421570934
attended her noble guest down stairs as they passed through the hall	 4.054036953144737

fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their	 3.3666191759214517
bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the	 4.308623904181674
advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though	 3.5456003913565444
one i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady	 3.586976259424043
and all the articles of plate which mr collins had promised and as he	 4.558809610673584
after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting	 2.9675448486404954
chapter xviii	 1.9302842045940272
but youhow are you cried elizabeth you look pale how much you	 3.679335877139542
let me write for you said jane if you dislike the trouble	 3.17707545436175
the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and	 4.485142024301465
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man but whether she	 4.7463898734246985
as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not	 3.295036539360899
minutes before the others appeared and he took the opportunity of	 3.5717119267789994
think it will be very tolerable besides it will not much signify what	 4.192022813557641
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and	 4.06995417618734
sake of discovering them	 3.323013740152268
very bad it is almost past belief and poor mr darcy dear lizzy only	 3.0952170188339228
she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information	 3.4203151236582006
company i am sure	 4.006695075750517
i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy	 4.341808030429609
directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing	 4.21299313864324
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give	 3.715502942794436
what could be the meaning of itit was impossible to imagine it was	 3.8514793763635455
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was	 3.130865285207352
i wish i could say any thing to comfort you replied elizabeth but	 3.13916045084349
last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a	 3.475486025579993
and mrs hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and	 4.551767826555597
it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an illnatured tone that	 4.343532197707138
for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle and you saw the	 4.083780241529144
persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to	 4.6129338622744065
i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon	 3.3678488675660665
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in	 3.340282793668286
the place immediately and mrs younge was of course removed from	 3.7343335759836793
and jane and for their sakes had patience with her mr darcy was	 5.292618953251977
family jane heard them with horror a gamester she cried this is	 4.061297819038148
a long dispute followed this declaration but mr bennet was firm it	 3.856842001677013
acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had	 3.2765600647210915
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his	 5.314420259629788
her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach	 3.0267665382315694

foundation as set forth in section <NUMBER> below	 3.3351605366610495
while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend	 3.827793425676652
not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals	 3.7373045461913827
noi feel he may defy us there and as to laughter we will not expose	 4.145401054703776
of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit it amazes	 3.6499817747050924
added	 3.9414535624552496
connection he had to be sure done much she was ashamed to think how	 4.17387283128062
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and	 3.159946968164951
next day	 3.2982334168667284
my object then replied darcy was to shew you by every civility	 4.422842474787535
present elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was	 4.817169358309253
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then	 3.33671029521141
people could be meant than those with whom she was connected there	 3.2437206581522777
go my dear cried her mother and shew her ladyship about the	 4.194536449068685
which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving	 3.7209961556574926
had often great enjoyment out of doors her favourite walk and where	 4.085740520988562
together after a short silence the lady first spoke she wished him to	 3.2048827383670444
hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered	 4.262870008742268
almost no restrictions whatsoever you may copy it give it away or	 2.461995602317886
in observed	 3.898955747728927
and advised them to do it differently found fault with the arrangement	 3.7698045060985335
much reluctance	 3.1526301281015066
short duration the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the	 3.4874368555499706
of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many	 3.8349382083866135
wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing	 4.208280898687567
i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourites guilt	 3.6402516085930623
were placed lady catherine sir william and mr and mrs collins sat	 3.9592978492948387
walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party	 4.137561361629368
his pocket but perhaps you would like to read it	 3.680994635207978
industriously circulated by yourselves do you not know that such a	 3.9703916766421483
grieved for him his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost he	 4.299714496568105
unless he really comes to see her	 3.484463111314073
heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his	 5.18250682833098
he then told her of georgianas delight in her acquaintance and of her	 3.407711480758866
not by when i told mamma and the others all about it are not you	 4.209341567012342
the former faults of any person without knowing what their present	 3.9967049777287627
excuse my interferenceit was kindly meant	 4.695829734180558
miss bennet paused a little and then replied surely there can be no	 3.737999610617781
how long has she been such a favouriteand pray when am i to wish you	 3.932000660091881
every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief	 4.341029373336822
herself with and one too who had probably been his own companion from	 3.247514071411709
probably notbut mr darcy can please where he chuses he does not	 3.8312930243322105
bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart	 3.6053134309271955
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a	 3.8251215120257362
the first grand object of every mornings impatience through letters	 4.089138702062817
are provoking me to it every moment	 4.126527048882435
much but he saw only the father the ladies were somewhat more	 3.1824013187418165
help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a	 3.803480650413798
depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them	 3.4400743896532373
while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enoughi	 4.2324227144808875
his daughters request for such it might be considered of being	 3.4270195918796262
and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt let me hear	 3.831581958514784
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure	 4.420037966207084
pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to youif from no better	 3.694519519379396
view of the house with weary ancles dirty stockings and a face	 5.974318729623017

been unable to give him a gentlemans education my father was not	 4.578400501477299
in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to	 4.536826544701322
soon led to another and mrs bennet found with amazement and horror	 3.626870521385007
ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great	 3.540141983241302
amongst the most violent against him was mrs bennet whose dislike of	 3.749618528996023
will save all the best of the covies for you	 5.3863594743589704
miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he	 3.4691402926234067
gardiner but perhaps to the lakes	 3.4491233524656137
partiality is not misleading me i think when i call charles most	 4.067651382527353
in general are not more like her does she live near you sir	 3.064129738562339
on these occasions mrs gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeths	 3.9481303220187822
i am sure said she i cried for two days together when colonel	 3.1565433560885667
mr collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight but his	 3.4975966379886594
outside the united states us laws alone swamp our small staff	 3.302154974878109
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you your	 3.2963117850100296
incomprehensible but now it was all too natural for such an attachment	 3.5749227132278545
renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting	 3.5918401540951916
not yet learnt to condemn themwith respect to that other more	 3.766888602818754
effectually to what they related mr darcy who never looks at any	 3.299838321994459
by teatime however the dose had been enough and mr bennet was glad to	 4.501853147582523
international donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make	 3.550144340371032
pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited	 3.436751960717854
kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe	 4.240315357009313
private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before	 3.5913257523515814
did conquer her fathers incredulity and reconcile him to the match	 5.213894990976307
absence	 4.406961780257003
gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the	 4.849646869305006
indeed you are mistaken i have no such injuries to resent it is not	 4.8982629013726
the most agreeable man i ever sawand if he becomes really attached to	 3.622527676249104
conversation	 3.919653468081957
settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly	 3.2417749965128135
clothes the wedding clothes i will write to my sister gardiner about	 3.297373836712181
having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in	 3.3043998875898932
such a striking civility as miss darcys in coming to them on the very	 3.5087431441430303
continue the subject	 3.5685693061048323
her unwillingness to see mr darcy it determined her not to attend her	 3.8919493562315126
him happy if they had my friend has an excellent understandingthough	 3.6354943344166135
me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could	 3.67967670610704
i comfort myself with thinking replied jane that he certainly would	 3.3942894576542098
carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if	 4.268672121803916
mr darcy bowed	 3.2234151020735093
could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other	 4.626770973994356
the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard mr darcy	 3.9379574355513065
two girls had the honour of assisting mrs jenkinson to make up her	 4.318181996246308
end of vol i	 3.5645695707357063
he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling he	 4.02056442652227
continued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joined	 4.963095414498739
thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears	 3.3732716580653164
appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed	 3.389132764853578
tranquillity	 1.9356690691114107
wickhams alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated	 3.52930971173279
how should you have liked making sermons	 3.4854622716724792
such a clue as that it might be of essential consequence at present we	 3.831324903625352
conversation with the ladies and sir william to elizabeths high	 3.100870736363481
whether all her sisters were at longbourn there was not much in the	 4.197713886922749
how i should like to be married before any of you and then i would	 4.07850102170389
warm commendation of him narrowly observed them both without supposing	 3.446582612348857
to insist upon her marrying him	 3.4362454062546304
till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him	 3.5307984069923
cousins conduct does not suit my feelings why was he to be the judge	 4.1826204494305665
necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence	 4.0454686575495575
resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her	 4.515907840679568
being spoke to	 3.6495717466094866
longbourn mr gardiner was a sensible gentlemanlike man greatly	 3.5489929266562386
present unknown she saw all the glories of the camp its tents	 4.304172893886942
next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky	 3.694619121803544
some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn	 3.592110526304381
distribute copies of a project gutenbergtm work in a format other than	 4.020384329658765
said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of	 3.754078084246028
extraordinary one after my declaration i do assure you that i am not	 4.029258719185977
to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was	 3.8433310241965777
situation	 4.110922191298444
rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private	 4.8792441919140455
well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart and if	 3.297193258620649
darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily	 3.8329022297566175
us compliments always take you by surprise and me never what	 3.364521151834965
meryton thought she might as well call on you i suppose she had	 3.554364981046471
darcy she was directly retreating but the person who advanced was now	 3.705661593157022
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer	 3.4701762329983046
la replied kitty it looks just like that man that used to be with	 3.022394331204711
spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to	 4.968038143854242
seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much	 5.126550974593671
short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard	 3.395029932205241
another	 3.908591185545264
miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though	 4.842226878861592
wickham you must be very happy it is a great comfort to have you	 4.545070442351032
rid of her two most deserving daughters with what delighted pride she	 3.1222890108495576
lydia were far from envying miss lucas for mr collins was only a	 4.402864830342712
unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it	 4.387247842218787
balls and young men her father would never consent to her going	 3.175521140415106
to depart mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing	 3.664458497635975
darcy is	 3.719693711174244
charlotte so very plainbut then she is our particular friend	 3.610600938048585
youngest sister has left all her friendshas elopedhas thrown	 3.760758375047853
chapter x	 1.9302842045940272
she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach	 3.662317338874393
a certain person that we all like	 3.5746341817455503
a man who had felt less might	 3.3235235049876906
he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard	 3.7574831424908597
gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and you	 4.549307103036617
wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for	 3.7275907835212467

suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter	 5.324489352682036

which she might in future be able to dispense	 3.0860175364811147
hand but in vain elizabeth was determined nor did sir william at all	 3.2784102977174974

seeking him up stairs with their mother when they were met by the	 3.60105920035975

tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards the prospect of such	 4.6539465745573505
friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked	 3.890061950823539

of his friend for though jane had the most generous and forgiving	 4.008477165274462
take whatever you like and get away	 3.2847401553265465

respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked	 3.349887513006199

lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in	 3.934534535736299
but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sisters	 3.4939111400243763

oh charlotte says she hardly ever does it is the greatest of favours	 3.530545745650398

evening said elizabeth the conduct of neither if strictly examined	 3.3390717663769864
of music then pray speak aloud it is of all subjects my delight i	 3.496554446747565

reflection by every thing but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence	 3.5565166306351164
yes or i will never see her again	 3.4385657799942138
likely to be in this country much longer	 4.297870141348219
must not let your fancy run away with you you have sense and we all	 3.4424278267538924
sake turning to charlotte i am glad of it but otherwise i see no	 3.6170423670251384
following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed	 4.804413075624376
the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more	 3.4300315121583043
i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her	 3.885267951754446
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment	 3.5008002066824364
mr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted	 2.9994774104784225
if it was to be secret said jane say not another word on the	 3.865504550895876
paid him but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own	 4.106320359501197
it	 2.983679824964844
not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and	 3.4410631848770006

happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other	 3.348924329258282
my dear niece	 3.3385318122083363

but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the	 3.3450609398296973
that he is always here so often it is on your account that he has been	 3.603742287609837
ten days time he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably	 3.3579977944320776
enquiry after the health of her family she answered with equal	 2.913404278309926
he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were and that	 3.437527322669766
he is a sweet tempered amiable charming man he cannot know what mr	 3.9234802640272894
unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in and i hope my dinners	 3.516825279896662
his will be disregardedwhy did not you seek legal redress	 5.123957990018072
which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against	 3.4745315613070438
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire	 4.452994143917907
indifferent would have prevented his coming down again	 3.5862690986316763
pitied	 1.9356690691114107
jane who were dancing together recovering himself however shortly	 3.1112120930479534
she did indeed louisa i could hardly keep my countenance very	 3.477347513173788
mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then	 3.3003150017176983
miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction	 3.5569755920894846
of them talk fast enough and wickham who happened to sit near	 3.205891644956623
field after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springing	 4.874178227604026
sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth	 3.394708817641607
immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of	 4.613761995923249
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon	 2.7605844199817184
sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they	 3.8131564240409914
charlotte once or twice she could discern a faint blush but in general	 4.872589189073462
a misfortune to be liked by him mrs long told me last night that he	 3.4577309288918716
are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady	 3.390922529937527
hatefully mercenary and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer	 3.6323604511302943
they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while	 5.074025879354791
family never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified	 3.543086312140015
well thensupposing them to be in london they may be there though	 3.8440802659209345
of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man	 3.4373525301822365
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever	 3.9754885702062546
she was still dear to him perhaps he had been civil only because he	 3.2930155558130556
having them all to dine with her	 3.942301288144887
uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the	 4.071436857770215
no one made any reply she then yawned again threw aside her book and	 3.9347151260779007
what can be the meaning of this said charlotte as soon as he was	 3.149241507282134
and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending	 3.23470221839388
with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia	 3.5940006687534756
were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere	 3.645376907427968
they each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with mr	 3.1866075960857896
could only tell her nieces what they already knew that mr denny had	 3.4207094477177673
elizabeth said to her	 3.3656840751807793
and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him	 3.3711196530034044
against a young woman of lydias connections which is not likely	 3.6120639699790655
you mistake me my dear i have a high respect for your nerves they	 4.26108946192593
but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when	 3.2734802541749364
a word about it till now	 3.5867239162638027
to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must soon	 3.3926465027898067
expected her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment	 4.172727387600273
entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely to	 3.713048339502316
evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of its	 3.5178858066877288
liked a red coat myself very welland indeed so i do still at my heart	 4.136255927780874
wondered it had escaped her before she saw the indelicacy of putting	 3.9745479274743944
going on in the country as in town	 3.28843901904873
attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility	 4.124901668644243
you know nothing of the matter that is all to be forgot perhaps i	 5.06207529916801
yes maam all	 3.404097711364299
unreserved correspondence i depend on you for that to these high	 3.3099165416485774
were indisposed maria thought speaking out of the question and the	 3.4666879933403307
pay	 5.031137603483912
opinion that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the	 3.6935244157327043
think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly	 3.4931868588797275
had voluntarily done for lydia he heard her with astonishment	 3.071434975418682
surprised to find that he meditated a quick return mrs bennet wished	 3.8040980701645832
compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than	 4.7835284370709426
when the ladies returned to the drawingroom there was little to be	 3.41427165686179
with great energybut it is a subject which always makes a lady	 4.832622984387387
ready to take them all home	 3.4991568612916293
a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she	 4.050008106927347
their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to	 4.218767321340624
jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their	 4.337834191526868

so very guarded if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill	 4.245364812576488
him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by i only fear that	 4.697233274599424
give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london	 3.7993149843698433
them from mr darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to	 4.594809430114249
yes vanity is a weakness indeed but pridewhere there is a real	 4.533897795549097
telling again what had been already written and when it closed	 3.6462531393644393
intelligence every day added something to their knowledge of the	 3.35837804664191
on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by	 4.244130231605152
with less perplexity her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what	 4.254531868642214
little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she	 4.4750190172088775
her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind	 3.347808049787613
that whether married or single he must always be her model of the	 3.8966444290879405

posterity with all the eclat of a proverb	 3.5539988492666525
and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it	 3.8223748778062228
a great many indeed said her companion with a sigh	 3.433551333317054
thought was still worse not a syllable was uttered by either and	 4.773158116471031

there was no want of discourse the bride and her mother could neither	 5.098246941851754
good heaven what is to become of us what are we to do would they	 3.48318706355953

of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness	 3.5538809458412026

jane oh lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed	 3.31927888443328
hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the	 3.4133100061411548
they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a	 3.7877649559979996
then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your	 3.7354120025282898
object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her	 4.571964687533723
they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me	 3.407961820090471
entering the marriage state	 3.2652176187294555
darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the	 3.704619039204736
airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure girls can i do any	 3.341041135728483
the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not	 3.46938232901662
conversation with mr gardiner elizabeth could not but be pleased	 3.2444789241900946
which would admit of a chair and on the gentlemens approaching one of	 5.496585460484582
possessed of bringing on the renewal of his addresses	 3.070685122132661
them as nonsense i cannot quite agree with you there what say you	 3.5148315485730097

and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it it is	 3.747607368138675
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than	 3.8254004237381314
even to charlottes wishes to be the case and after various	 3.999547844434477
this is quite shockinghe deserves to be publicly disgraced	 4.184398183443217
supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and	 3.563789554750775
be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparisonbut	 4.24349092981909

you an offer of marriage is it true elizabeth replied that it was	 3.2153875827542273
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female	 4.593036959774096
indifference continued to express her admiration of captain carter and	 3.903158900515513
blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the	 3.520229768844208
near concern in all his cousins affairs and whose character she had no	 4.051419200467751
that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other	 3.743252720712356
you need not be frightened i never heard any harm of her and i dare	 5.072278077557866
hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to	 3.62153734407804
have received benefit of greater importance	 3.463371359669976
she found herself so affectionately received she saw instantly that her	 3.34703961793785
determined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets	 3.5029216919967
what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud	 3.7129626833963814
of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted	 3.6572275767990643
you have yes there was something in that i told you so from the	 3.480199542651565
then getting up walked about the room elizabeth was surprised but said	 3.210885367710958
mrs gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now	 3.4830869926668138
lord what will become of me i shall go distracted	 3.941331985880071
an hour after every body else was gone which gave them time to see how	 3.362290599482688
latter was thinking only of his breakfast	 3.5398683256947105
mr philipss house and then made their bows in spite of miss lydias	 3.805686455736907
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering	 4.355688490319976
thing material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity	 4.434102732863231
gratification but when mrs philips understood from him what rosings	 3.19639703560908
was all done very well she had also to anticipate how her visit would	 3.242050186941277

oh yesthe handsomest young lady that ever was seen and so	 3.0240902796357405
thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on	 3.128809471655606
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather	 4.481102086089565
forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means	 5.169166647135371
electronic work or any part of this electronic work without	 3.3598686258947983

this sad business of janes for my part i am determined never to speak	 3.157347180150382
of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness of	 4.317796698132418
resolved that it could be the last resource if her private enquiries as	 4.265838712111905
i am astonished my dear said mrs bennet that you should be so	 3.3132119961701045
her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me if your	 4.922845027349036
their journey gave them directions as to the best method of packing	 3.9502272464773776
do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an	 3.326727306888677
sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham	 3.361531691301342
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world	 3.801898221853929

them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they	 3.797531293853287
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from	 3.2212159938673075
that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more	 4.356673027300275
out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling to think	 4.8049948122235175
her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him	 3.386781835927323
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire	 3.58615926815912
would she have behaved were questions with which she amused herself	 3.8236880488757694
the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt it soothed	 4.8698726222016395
prevented any public exposure but i wrote to mr wickham who left	 4.228381990424532
who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of	 3.812461734200892

elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in	 4.801992682724029

marked their several meetings in derbyshire and as she threw a	 4.32050070627393
the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great	 3.4902830811022287
collins toowhy should he have it more than anybody else	 3.6664055485612144
reached the carriage mr and mrs gardiner were half a quarter of a	 4.253566233152874
cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the	 5.084810180192337
mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large	 4.160619910690097
occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself	 3.680704609687282
to offend mr darcyyou will never recommend yourself to his friend by	 3.9423914779236635
their intending to go off had colonel forster seen denny himself	 3.1532179911877822
flirtation and officers have been in her head she has been doing	 3.7987042838166714
agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it i am	 3.26899800384607
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict	 3.687985300416503
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and	 3.423581296299653
continued her mother but at the same time mr bingley it is very	 4.014830944038853
gutenberg is a registered trademark and may not be used if you	 4.219429094425708
longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard it	 4.135043768907313
your affectionate friend	 3.6674598640507847
cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified	 4.042187676878074
course of this morning	 3.8575431166947167
feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again in her own past	 3.616961249750361
rapturous air the fine proportion and finished ornaments they followed	 4.904843668960903
the scheme it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at	 4.031280450912432
ever was seen	 3.62320554306039
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at	 3.599747450690428
event takes placewhich however as i have already said may not be	 4.513625834428945
in your name throughout the whole of this business i will	 3.720282668852095
the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only	 4.5036766516938656
such a girl to be my nephews sister is her husband is the son of	 3.3071678186271436
want of attention to other peoples feelings and want of resolution	 3.4383808224812977
i enquired after their brother of course he was well but so much	 3.4888789428852096
delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of	 5.073300907795106
chapter xix	 1.9302842045940272
characteristic bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier	 3.2658975700775223
i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you	 3.7494894860808436
for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any	 3.883709473195021
communication would therefore do for all after a slight preparation	 3.3416513479194916
the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sir	 3.220864938331
her purchases look here i have bought this bonnet i do not think it	 3.9557954565365585
and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making	 4.735232248199114
catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying	 3.1993831183697403
his entrance of his having ten thousand a year the gentlemen	 3.6060387489481616
which it seems he has been told by some of the goodnatured gossiping	 3.6254383197475017
such a man to be worked on how are they even to be discovered i have	 4.357057270379722
only four dances i am sorry to pain youbut so it was he danced only	 3.8657165841070618
charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling but no	 3.511986120937307
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property	 3.6862737241536276
do you prefer reading to cards said he that is rather singular	 3.5407532292825086
due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which	 3.359677619736034
opinion of hertheir opinion of every bodywould always coincide	 3.796786484703133
humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at	 3.9933484051478834
i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment	 3.141781394783043
charlotte and a most attentive neighbour	 3.188072959126854
could most wish for and now do when you get to town find them out	 3.3219471640752385
entered the breakfastroom and congratulated both him and herself in	 4.153644249502207
my uncle is to send a servant for us	 3.6865962581463148
to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachmans	 3.6898919906401795
invented by mrs bell <NUMBER> charlotte street bedford square	 3.4324738536741455
always write such charming long letters to her mr darcy	 3.1653633299241557
have always supposed it to be my own faultbecause i would not take the	 4.701541328789637
of pleasure was lost in shame she felt anew the justice of mr darcys	 3.982597483173173
politeness there was good humour and kindnessmr darcy said very	 3.4817955580085345
variety of thought reconsidering events determining probabilities	 3.4437924916604628
states compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a	 4.796992729530592
friend and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a	 3.635747450307127
then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce	 4.014012162528498
elizabeth said	 3.307128491357425
be delighted with her she is all affability and condescension and i	 4.902218808737574
thought she could witness without trepidation	 3.915968015114552
to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much	 3.3597480226800114
again by her sister	 3.7633280448706463
a few days after this visit mr bingley called again and alone his	 3.2207914975846466
chapter iii	 1.9302842045940272
father was at leisure to be consulted one days delay she observed	 3.9577895575174673
but only because her husbands regiment happens to be so far off if	 4.226515082251663
gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party but	 3.9505740125214306
into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding	 3.145735603123194
sound and that you would never act in this way yourself	 4.062290307273151
for continuing their pursuit when mrs bennet was told of this she did	 4.382353642025554
long speeches of mr collins who was complimenting mr bingley and his	 4.568288185779432
terms of this agreement you may obtain a refund from the person or	 4.2333638055035845
gave way only to the greater distress of mr bingleys continued	 3.8493184470814743
other is miss de bourgh only look at her she is quite a little	 4.018761979400234
you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me	 4.717823320314984
mrs gardiner then rallied her niece on wickhams desertion and	 3.4118040155123293
oh hang kitty what has she to do with it come be quick be quick	 3.253823079202974
he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam	 3.7286962841412423
excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your	 3.915273802611727
they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and mrs bennet in	 3.6373769171977544
panegyric of compliment to yourselfand yet what is there so very	 3.3166170994647266
like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to	 3.7102348168071093
thinking there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of	 3.9537718524238032
elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such	 4.018472125372408
astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her she wished	 4.820701863857917
have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the	 3.5575222249684164
all cared about me we must have met long long ago he knows of my	 3.46960584488537
choose to be you shall not find me so my character has ever been	 3.5809280306113314
listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all	 3.634522589318701
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic kitty was the	 3.9847991719904563
beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake	 3.544664141672075
viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and	 3.960069955380652
so far what could your ladyship propose by it	 3.4775466566346678
succeeded for a few moments it was first broken by mrs annesley a	 3.2896196869999432
yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word	 3.104179348267833
she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of	 3.562336329219865
never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as	 4.082723774813646
generations	 1.9356690691114107
received an invitation from mrs forster the wife of the colonel of the	 3.4237174841545315
is unaccountable	 3.048990598000763
bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away	 3.417658828077563
no answer	 3.654728032300271
and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wickham his	 3.6632748202710728
more to give	 3.7292930907637056
governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have	 3.383988486206094
elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself	 3.8686492236251473
abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all	 4.23561627447579
deservedly dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she may	 4.020164884211448
words to her sister ran out of the room	 3.4493743273847763
explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give	 5.050579054145842
many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few	 3.5429449666584816
with any of them there was no one therefore who could be pointed out	 4.036425204053949
acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly	 3.773669446504722
confidante	 1.9356690691114107
no said her father wickhams a fool if he takes her with a	 4.190634924414716
were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been	 3.433789761122934
judgment he stands much in awe his fear of her has always operated i	 3.8954006353148656
have sometimes been called so fine i never could perceive any thing	 3.4762371055117423
elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of	 5.356184703577996
of their sight i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their	 3.7897289819294806
our own vanity that deceives us women fancy admiration means more than	 3.100742087863978
understand it i shall then give over every expectation every wish of	 3.1907438156179144
rained hard her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was	 4.732032272339657
had elizabeths opinion been all drawn from her own family she could	 4.051736703890332
politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place	 3.397539805441881
repinebut to be sure it would have been such a thing for me the	 3.4694288387320156
of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration the	 3.294806152934278
hide it not doing its office	 3.16663472957688
increasing	 1.9356690691114107
you that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon	 3.9463434745621706
since you went away miss lucas is married and settled and one of my	 3.0493091849886853
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish	 3.816746938915806
if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to	 3.5986686477418126
north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her	 3.830639877190844
gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before	 4.946580179235759
feel the obliged mr collins was gratified and with a more smiling	 3.835439328958146
to accept them is absolutely impossible my feelings in every respect	 3.263116945387609
next saturday	 3.9444765010332246
her notice mrs philips was quite awed by such an excess of good	 4.4211450547983215
disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own	 3.254940344686609
avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world a sense of	 3.638270654601027
the north of england a circumstance more deeply impressed on their	 4.472853548170375
a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour	 4.179921979741112
demand it of your justice	 3.5015861370547854
her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her	 3.9738074572240443
no one but mrs bennet regretted that their stay would be so short and	 3.6382415115431543
succeeds but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art	 4.5618164699952235
the others returned into the house mr collins no sooner saw the two	 3.313359585535755
which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely any thing	 3.336843149927097
walk and turning towards her these offences might have been	 3.1081672574915737
pleasure	 3.2964052735089813
regard they had frequently been staying with her in town	 4.281295654285627
the little value he put on his own good qualities	 3.622746000258199
pause who more particularly wishes to be known to youwill you allow	 3.842878077638545
we will be down as soon as we can said jane but i dare say kitty is	 3.868788385121135
now i am quite happy said she for you will be as happy as myself i	 3.8910635796138537
to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of	 4.635749195103574
would and the argument ended only with the visit	 5.0135744766788175
the communication excited many professions of concern and enough was	 3.7479931874546564
lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte	 4.019294255752767
want to think you perfect and you set yourself against it do not be	 3.2158856958459
in meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one	 4.119930807337637
having very frequent parties at home these parties were acceptable to	 3.131267874556005
subject of tenderness than of pride his sense of her inferiorityof	 3.7426533496888856
kitty for hill i will put on my things in a moment my dear dear	 3.863696836112036
the likeness of mr wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures	 3.5332847323968983
but not before they went to brighton	 3.6837859385143266
what had happened at netherfield she read with an eagerness which	 3.638608099412461
attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life he had not	 3.7564453766630335
wedding need not be put off for mr darcy might have done as well	 3.718849923882827
make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was	 3.7800583761076747
convenience of the world i cannot forget the follies and vices of	 3.6716516965451302
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to	 4.610740190883926
apologising for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with	 3.7238770691612815
excellent manager i dare say if she is half as sharp as her mother	 4.071149546721668
younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time	 4.751963730049539
impatient for display	 2.800829340514296
silence at length she spoke again i have just had a letter from	 3.5626872965554828
witness of undoubted veracity mr wickham is the son of a very	 4.27781881149737
original plan	 4.007755956909991
exceedingly fair lady lucas began directly to calculate with more	 3.8977891290225273
had ever known before	 3.4069609331348385
insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of	 3.5058061729633394
the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that	 3.5875723853560153
his being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and certainly	 3.862332646347778
i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all	 3.4484163852168526
question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner	 5.167062544935188
was lady catherine books and a billiard table but gentlemen cannot be	 3.680905628079176
he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his	 4.619930673022491
every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example	 3.0545878692582575
selecting a wife as i certainly did	 3.3990589750252456
disagreeable	 3.0214350255985782
know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear	 3.3510551430854285
ohyour unclehe keeps a manservant does hei am very glad you	 4.266023106481711
with her he might have better success he stood by her however for	 4.034987960857204
agreeably engaged i have been meditating on the very great pleasure	 4.932894775883414
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every	 4.640345133837903
possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister	 4.320298569517984
elizabeth turned away to hide a smile	 4.898163001207474
anxious parade walk up to her mothers right hand and hear her say to	 3.5812497490307633
kind was done away miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a	 3.3228377382023093
you are very kind sir i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may	 3.092041554336479
setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to	 3.573738358401073
of his designing friends and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to	 3.9619803773373543
with only one there is but such a quantity of merit between them just	 4.603382719986353
the difficulty of finding any thing to do which was the more probable	 3.811401617526598
between the mercenary and the prudent motive where does discretion end	 3.899841385218232
as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile very	 3.883786821377242
soon as they were gone mr collins began	 3.077922022458853
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been that it	 3.999033615583423
in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a	 4.211742432524397
report is spread abroad	 3.857725913402661
expectation of one wedding made every body eager for another to supply	 3.1571153254463105
but consider your daughters only think what an establishment it would	 3.658888678798494
urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly to receive her	 4.386029997811344

of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy and you yourself when last at	 3.7831349645913983

and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin	 3.2892139687957473
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had	 3.2593192853135924

questions but answered them very composedlylady catherine then	 3.6773017533944232

introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers	 5.129077942845495
elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning	 3.663044111030545
that sum	 2.827520093813753

persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be	 3.9268869959214387

not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did	 3.462911572179425
or had you intended any more serious consequence	 3.4159141949556635
but incredulous for mrs bennet with more perseverance than	 4.079048204428239
could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there	 4.035989843793618
happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a	 4.235067581663675
preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my	 3.3723658873286535
behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever	 4.7526955456694475
hopeless of seeing him before but on the third morning after his	 4.20787103630555
one of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to mr	 3.88375808768022
mistakenor at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of	 2.877264634790358
elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath	 3.7438260327579664
to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last	 4.592717405258721
elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such	 4.103875422551278

and do you like her	 3.2158384760138596
i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy	 4.423395043715628
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent	 3.0092006425260522
gentlewoman for my sake and for your own let her be an active	 3.2891965218087984
sense of the word that he has neither integrity nor honour that he is	 3.6833110726823763
well and what news does it bring good or bad	 3.1457209099513785
her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of	 4.298207262112143

while mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village	 3.3657552833550346
duplicity in all this but i will endeavour to banish every painful	 4.2723334768118715
pleasure	 3.2964052735089813

believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he	 4.109908703924328
future niece nor could she think without a smile of what her	 3.620759953650998
finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to	 4.106598728201305
bingleys regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the	 4.2142052511115535
i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was	 3.7320110631470906
which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time	 3.8322536555869857
her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of	 4.742949577193608
hertfordshire my dear cousin i flatter myself at least that you will	 3.831099136726275
been to blame i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression	 3.6398899900718553
she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said	 3.9420111500043116
great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly	 4.184062988194267
my dear aunt this is being serious indeed	 3.149280591304897
of your sisters countenance and air was such as might have given	 3.6163874203749073
mr wickhams charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could	 3.5986512629135707
most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the	 4.348278798368574
you are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of your	 3.4922775558124433
i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father	 4.145798524662956
finished her speech of what are you talking	 3.3315056848175617
engaged by wickham for those very dancesand to have mr collins	 3.782152381254899
declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the	 3.5468079787476436
figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own	 3.3432890368082915
in pompous nothings on his side and civil assents on that of his	 4.093017064447105
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless mr darcy	 3.488623331328886
rather thin but however the little theatre was open well and so just	 3.7617647313084994
gained her point and had time to consider of it her reflections were	 3.512666503933665

even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife	 4.664578439816723
yesif darcy does not put it off again but i am at his disposal he	 3.723174169995046
flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me	 3.2222227282013116
myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both	 3.191810189832938
less interesting mode of attachment be that as it may she saw him go	 3.4284749730479493

she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr	 3.8686818571716355
because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party	 3.8808890652646224
been the culprit was wretched in the thought of what her sister must	 4.536871552869721
idle certainly might	 3.419020227528712

before her uncle and aunts arrival but they did pass away and mr and	 3.623756269369023
and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy	 4.908495707035725
officers of the shire were in general a very creditable	 3.5812164030412146
yes there can for mine is totally differentwill you hear it	 4.1814761678487296
arrested herand she beheld a striking resemblance of mr darcy with	 4.872854514741358
falsehood	 1.9356690691114107
possible	 3.6871186232571955
assistance would be every thing in the world he will immediately	 3.731159580905134
but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four	 2.8610000134340363
and it was done for the beston this subject i have nothing more	 4.612573415201263
herself i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the	 3.5211744757848678
least that advantage	 3.8251340639951854
generally is jane had been a week in town without either seeing or	 3.5599936284766898
convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted	 3.645227913317482
hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a	 4.792551020564081
of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being	 3.3854151539254485
wickham and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr darcys	 4.421242829515362
but it will have no effect on me	 3.5286122727303844
who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and	 3.2973178702461916
in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised	 4.585991627563517

hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs bennets civilities	 3.9559736304967257
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its	 3.717436143971342

to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do	 4.467934584890092
sir williams interruption has made me forget what we were talking of	 3.3767400518204083
bingleyand pray what is the result	 3.5941094937852487
regard with any complacency his anxiety for jane was evident and his	 3.4929096296693265
disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some	 3.5480573917833005
weight i may suffer from the want of money younger sons cannot marry	 3.2706421553422658
such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice	 3.753354911810161
this though i doubt whether his reserve or anybodys	 3.5136939344254055
good deal the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are	 3.641950697192849

after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words	 3.2651338012101223
eight the express was sent off directly my dear lizzy they must	 3.1204408451716548
the other is charlottes marriage it is unaccountable in every view it	 4.248797110403814
her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage	 4.32766465504259
instituted by the church of england as a clergyman moreover i	 3.642945671813517

to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be	 3.4432803096600253
elizabeth began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood	 3.615726153844757
mr darcys letter to lady catherine was in a different style and	 3.4734135151221137
alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness	 3.0729533935741498
darcy after enquiring of her how mr and mrs gardiner did a question	 4.299653273201358
author jane austen	 4.111983727316685
prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate	 3.963670284691837
listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre	 3.438655785049464
it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me your	 3.258402573786436
in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by	 6.000581485390208
neighbourhood they shall never have admittance i will not encourage	 3.6901650978357936
his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said	 3.9098860285215076
that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins	 4.079327285612662
afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly	 4.68976621406642
with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all	 3.938802769538142
whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable	 5.226444884764539
their engagements at rosings it was some days however before they	 3.0481336205677527
booksoh noi am sure we never read the same or not with the same	 3.457406397341243
their three months acquaintance they had been intimate two	 3.732243361925643
single	 1.9356690691114107
i often think said she that there is nothing so bad as parting with	 3.828486056942937
all for janes sake you know and there is no occasion for talking to	 3.625308795880158
the indirect boastfor you are really proud of your defects in	 4.421944052858823
mr bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly shewed	 3.225267031678797
prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her	 3.5431921228965373
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run	 3.6965185275021137
unreasonable my brother admires her greatly already he will have	 3.2545904564257913
hardly think a months ablution enough to cleanse him from its	 3.756070138585184
kindness the day passed most pleasantly away the morning in bustle and	 3.455654766474343
body especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment i cannot	 4.361377053744565
when they ascended the steps to the hall marias alarm was every	 5.059652162922935
pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence	 3.817581764591455
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of	 3.678757125605935
carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their	 3.5407695616509702
saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts now asked her if	 3.352427501069359
the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin	 4.438846166866823
though it is charlotte lucas you shall not for the sake of one	 3.538816877007363
to depreciate such pleasures they would doubtless be congenial with	 4.586946856656495
backgammon mr bennet accepted the challenge observing that he acted	 3.4363597795382725
gentlemen did approach and when mr wickham walked into the room	 3.7111219809095126
great not handsome enough to dance with i wish you had been there my	 3.1769230349053426
oh yesdo let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be	 4.206384691999872
the latter probableif it be so if i have been misled by such	 3.8303340949253073
despicable	 1.9356690691114107
to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life	 3.3828955287204607
silent till they reached the house their father then went to the	 3.33149184237118
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and	 3.6827874922626687
children of his own and may have more how could he spare half ten	 3.8946291036116287
did mr darcy give you his reasons for this interference	 4.111416990198202
thing and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two	 4.6892766602051585
there is not much the matter with me	 3.3604121394863986
catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions	 3.2859780480809793
at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and	 3.832841216465111
indeed mama you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her	 4.7081049447298655
herself began scolding one of her daughters	 3.208814468003996
which was my chief inducement to enter the shire i knew it to be a	 3.3667596259782573
fresh pain i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner	 4.969648476641322
agreed in wishing for the sake of their sisters feelings and	 3.671242256642274
preserved	 1.9356690691114107
feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which	 4.797378121642687
good spirits mrs bennet invited him to dine with them but with many	 4.624789281680103
influenced by my hopes or fearsi did not believe her to be	 3.6559639403835402
talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away from	 3.3220967096586955
she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could	 4.23671028429933
wife may teach him i thought him very slyhe hardly ever	 3.7700200573650764
remained with no very cordial feelings towards him she told the story	 3.571038523805
i know are all chance in this world there is no knowing how estates	 3.3526944818949684

the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side elizabeth	 3.4312306286180445
yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no	 3.4322131835006986
tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which	 4.152527453888457
accomplished for her age her performance on the pianoforte is	 4.09509338602796
my dear mr bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of	 3.6702028117037324
himself obliged to accept	 3.6010826364214825
nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne	 4.442308996649607
though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could	 4.441584087742261
i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise	 3.0817265544552104

certain forgive the questionare you quite certain that you can be	 5.117278904484904

material a step without her ladyships concurrence	 2.9663698979062527
lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to	 4.766939403150855
before anybody else however your coming just at this time is the	 3.305729758738971

with the rest of the party she now lost every expectation of pleasure	 3.2180170260140333
instead her liveliness had been never worse timed there was no help	 4.538948164605334
upon my word said mrs gardiner i begin to be of your uncles	 3.300832832635584
could have the advantage of a london master she has a very good notion	 3.532881372215049
that mr collins should be able to procure any womans good opinion	 3.7218639746476
i am now convinced	 3.5062909276070915

can never be what we once were to each other	 3.491149106741376
i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen	 3.8624685639087617
long sleeves	 3.219084237792706
they were all astonished and mr bennet who could by no means wish for	 3.8105276918194826
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings	 4.676154113226314
he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to any	 3.2449101203949424
on his account and my nieces it is mr wickhams intention to go	 3.2731866209254035
how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode our plain	 4.103662458201684
home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor mr	 3.6112155766467797
she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy by the	 3.718246817404248
campful of soldiers to us who have been overset already by one poor	 3.7646088900218806

with them many instructions on execution and taste elizabeth received	 3.88703171578774
discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he	 3.5187686486476926
daughter let us come to a right understanding into one house in this	 3.138404673737439
i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now	 4.596506236598417
for my attentions to you last spring is nothing due to me on that	 3.8606069584304126
oh she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld but there is one	 4.091420945932273
chapter xiii	 1.9302842045940272
has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due	 3.597185825589786
affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence	 3.246872329385125
of which prudence forbad the disclosure she dared not relate the other	 4.275010065128852
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal mr darcys	 3.8294821959066465
look on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when	 4.546075554609726
bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield	 3.4486276599513714
unpardonable in me	 3.4087569451239745
himself to produce a more valuable soninlaw	 3.5916717283154025
there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment	 3.53295415262682
letter i wish this may be more intelligible but though not	 4.034829101066476
writing i would not give up mr collinss correspondence for any	 4.105731941236928
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it	 3.742421843072218
situation hastily exclaimed i beg your pardon but i must leave you	 4.031561027204609
that is not very likely our authority was too good	 3.4280683382006445
mr wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the	 2.9735101893182367
yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot come	 2.922905938480755
as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth warmlyi have spent	 3.7257566072997768
she soon afterwards said	 3.1229140735082157
their mother mr collinss letter had done away much of her illwill	 3.5299218014724194
the matter as you do now	 4.023985058694367
equal	 4.0523475431749985
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish	 4.1573696002614415
express that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer you	 3.582806376659658
such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen	 3.9265526122533534
her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been	 3.8295743007612972
brotherinlaw of wickham every kind of pride must revolt from the	 3.2239123428336747
daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this	 3.6098950885800076
conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the	 3.735637640950234
true you are a gentlemans daughter but who was your mother who	 3.644760775916846
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal	 4.757912162627314
neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he	 3.5344301755670875
the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have	 3.384570271558883
living in his gift he was my godfather and excessively attached to me	 5.342553090213323
jane then took it from her pocketbook and gave it to elizabeth these	 4.088548557883689
child and now heres mr bennet gone away and i know he will fight	 4.101070660898247

acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest	 3.102997708580775
a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but	 4.207356952272355
be greater than at home he heard her attentively and then said	 3.997415721161772
i had not thought mr darcy so bad as thisthough i have never liked	 3.4624603390815394
all your sorrow and disgrace let me advise you then my dear sir	 4.328705113365149

fullpursuing her way along the lane she then began it it was dated	 4.305787514460792
room	 3.803558981035743
i admire all my three sonsinlaw highly said he wickham perhaps	 3.1089842914722725
you liked her i hope she will turn out well	 3.3365666534619844
elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said	 4.419198743820474
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to	 4.520613108587727
great perseverance yet time and her aunt moved slowlyand her patience	 3.5996983706621606

she asked the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so pen	 4.02735581133331
jane on their first arrival at lambton and this disappointment had	 3.6588780479052483
safe for herthat she was not enough recovered but jane was firm where	 4.139004478400176
aunt so well that i am not afraid of requesting it though i have	 3.990430990371178
ah cried mrs bennet shaking her head then she is better off than	 3.337367145096611
accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without	 4.007637185804855
fortnight not one party or scheme or any thing to be sure london was	 3.5967382362714377
elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend he	 4.235525739437888
with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr wickham and the	 4.221893450919811
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would	 4.254225282104542
they returned down stairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were	 3.4656707354028162

chapter iv	 1.9302842045940272
assure you it is much larger than sir william lucass	 3.2031353075154514
you are joking lizzy this cannot beengaged to mr darcy no no	 3.8145842320462275
that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion when mr	 3.549833339987128
ignorant i must be more explicit on the very day of my coming	 4.132451226946861
connections i never heard of her existence till the day before	 4.609135120258209
he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each	 4.330524216705494
you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner	 3.4178782208846425
spirits by all that affection could do	 3.767269381332183
people here abouts know i am married today i was afraid they might	 3.8153128841917456
it was a journey of only twentyfour miles and they began it so early	 3.2834281419611977
well then you need not be under any alarm i will take care of	 3.2884986700540355
other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone	 3.984638900749549
not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner	 4.079157711501974
lizzy said her father i have given him my consent he is the kind	 3.6946913591072255
cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement when hearing	 4.491363276272786
london and had she been able to receive them into her house they	 3.750369870241434
various recollections connected with him gave her a moments distress	 3.486051702307747
connectionhe left netherfield for london on the day following	 3.665810349493632
talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying	 3.6132224770976706
features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself	 3.464929666716408
the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of	 3.522151749757734
her being hereafter our sister i do not know whether i ever before	 3.599740481866073
elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards	 3.6670958437738017
yourself	 4.061372481051723
tis too much she added by far too much i do not deserve it oh	 4.216695597178452
bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and mr bennet spent the	 4.9838604364852666
returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given	 3.2299865472992755
can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good	 3.2387954928756058
at last to gosaying as she quitted the room if any young men come	 4.347316389781976

furniture in vain mr gardiner highly amused by the kind of family	 3.7659999227070298
either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from	 3.6825680814926396
she is so fond of mrs forster said she it will be quite shocking	 3.3852292059768923
justly make you hate me	 4.0234938362619515
the road with some abruptness wound it was a large handsome stone	 4.860347611862214
whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious in the desperation	 4.281754260732269
lost	 4.350671235269254
kinder than towards myself	 3.2676428392253767
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance	 3.6820485758341928
in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy she follows him to	 4.2778129891034
mr bingleys will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must	 3.4440687300707467
happiness jane had been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own	 4.574097334670737
towards discharging their bills their manner of living even when the	 4.143037585945917
wonder nor condemn but the belief of his selfconquest brought nothing	 4.718761988535481
wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were	 4.175914253945425
doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much	 3.4362636978464267
much but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no	 3.1143173653719276
wait for any opening of yours my aunts intelligence had given me	 3.271728646643801
knowledge of your ill opinion too and having to relate such a thing of	 3.3099387591601452
longbourn before she told her sister of mr darcys proposals to know	 3.8195627545713515
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and	 4.031722915562028
of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirms	 3.634861658608898
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly	 3.9915122764668967
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during	 4.213808018151115
before the carriage stopped at longbourn house	 3.950797405338502
the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her	 3.18511362356697
and half the night spent in conversation	 3.366826267946234
only headstrong in such matters as these in every thing else she is as	 3.556786832434747
guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his	 3.8361660038021475
stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes	 4.525546035312562
what i told you on that point when first we talked of it	 3.2123850114876755
violence of my affection to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and	 3.4340219997015278
connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling but we are none	 4.288821465003215
thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you	 3.8670171438739844
shaken she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you	 3.3273973469861824
what has been done for the young people his debts are to be paid	 4.3716531625440815
that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of	 3.1982209418256526
would have taken up their abode with her at length however our	 4.086905799420008
hertfordshire every body is disgusted with his pride you will not find	 4.730841121983875
slight inclination of the head she saw that he wanted to engage her on	 3.6491656457234933
of my own child but to be sure janeone does not often see any body	 3.9591075676055545
family they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now	 3.8104318798346224
delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you	 3.194903723611161
may often meet again	 3.4122923867565502
selfcommand to miss lucas you were mr bingleys first choice	 3.3614862854945424
despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with	 3.8858396386485117
abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin	 3.0633809358303066
in contempt for it she was received however very politely by them	 3.48478325297233
quite as their own i dare say whenever that happens	 3.9064021363857306
in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with her	 3.095805081796865
headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to	 3.2551076523382196
disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last	 4.529054968552585
our habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in	 4.70396907358864
friendly and obliging it was mr collinss picture of hunsford and	 3.532128169493662
hypocrisy of my soninlaw and pray lizzy what said lady catherine	 3.214729434930172
case here mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income but not	 3.80357678821866
notice but he certainly has not known her long	 3.667830424793999
he chose fordyces sermons lydia gaped as he opened the volume and	 3.940904877372699
nay if you are so serious about it i shall consider the matter as	 3.5427854373305845
elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though	 3.3341347372640913
soon as she could to the girls who could not listen to their cousin	 3.6475143116745277
i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some	 3.5424052777924735
elder sisters she said to elizabeth	 3.1741603613518183
very gravelybut i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all	 3.668499226161352
i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had	 3.304762704434769
with him i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance	 3.638172578083922
certainly he replied biting his lips elizabeth hoped she had	 4.351351964425742
his commission so much the better it will save me a world of trouble	 3.581935395823383
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw	 3.191436447830015
disappointments abroad	 2.0857370267093605
from the drawingroom they could distinguish nothing in the lane and	 3.8432088524423778
continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown	 3.143925664533358
wishes for your health and happiness	 3.403460482531675
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over	 4.074403605561231
being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend	 3.2142425855674324
with an air of distant civility mr collins however was not	 2.9244918094740906
your situation with much compassion	 3.408534566832164
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects but when they see	 3.9147905554884077
himselffrom whom she had previously received the information of his	 4.021207787378109
sure will not hear of her removal	 3.430596235620452
surprised very much surprisedso lately as mr collins was wishing to	 4.8353672106292835
never sir	 3.8243084710476394
shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well	 4.0502478582073955
my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts let us hope for	 3.014443004517371
calling yesterday to thank me she finds miss pope a treasure lady	 4.270090461430431
herself	 3.188408201310134
was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were	 3.796949764843844
wickham immediately to elizabeths mind and from the observation of the	 3.632202986626819
great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen	 3.7304339529926573
and doubt as to the occasions justifying her coming so far alone the	 4.933127121264154
make such an awkward business of it did you see it	 4.218634962410612
he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia	 3.2613264616131423
whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general	 4.243719442697406
not do justice to his own disposition you have shewn him off now much	 3.685567099148941
poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the	 3.9644801769517537
to do	 3.528810375233325
marriage would scarcely seem valid exceeded all that she could believe	 4.669895157119378
on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her	 3.3472021077995895
countenance elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first	 3.8715244133670743
resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left	 3.99459821965345
done about pemberley cried mrs gardiner john told us mr darcy was	 3.396809518961974
enough from my thoughts	 3.7024730324397925
but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident	 3.3383851037531453
girls in his life every body had been most kind and attentive to him	 4.380903125244768
when is your next ball to be lizzy	 3.4075717826742045
mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley he	 4.207331914550931
good god what is the matter cried he with more feeling than	 3.052651714519227
heavy looking young man of five and twenty his air was grave and	 3.641425913355237
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance	 4.266132403163202
with hermiss darcy the daughter of mr darcy of pemberley and lady	 3.6927612797798037
settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity	 3.2089839274104683
venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually	 4.64164885009607
or cause to occur a distribution of this or any project gutenbergtm	 4.453523792635917
that you should come together oh he is the handsomest young man that	 3.846811551805593
businessdo clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of	 3.660633868236664
divide with me i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy	 4.060330135799352
she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets	 4.061765327042483
too much truth the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no	 3.193968017301648
and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement	 3.448647694399193
may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as	 4.134879544834913
let me know every thing that i am to know without delay will you tell	 3.9134691236793766
they agreed that mrs bennet should only hear of the departure of the	 3.563855232139851
mrs gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked	 3.453660392933674
tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in	 3.649729305458044
turn about the roomi assure you it is very refreshing after sitting	 3.960173662738023
the lakes and still thought there might have been time enough but it	 3.7951261832447103
property of some one or other of their daughters	 3.42888646522201
or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that	 3.155935046876499
female character	 3.567133195810293
to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows	 3.47292657313607
to maintain you when your father is deadi shall not be able to keep	 3.31296582124681
exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i	 3.8897580722318508
friend you see by janes account was persuaded of his never intending	 3.2651552612222727
much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing	 3.5201156797240496
accusations were illfounded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour	 3.267008602213897
it is not quite a week since they left brighton in a few days more we	 3.4175258733048786
defects such as but not limited to incomplete inaccurate or	 4.492422559872053
superscripted characters are enclosed by curly brackets	 3.978757340074483
she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and	 3.302652027304781
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcy	 4.328950771246569
see that your reproofs had been attended to how soon any other wishes	 3.9475437303376
honourable and ancient though untitled families their fortune on both	 3.8309373668215336
perceive that her spirits were affected by it they were more disturbed	 3.1597527335548503
exceed their income my dear mr bennet cried his wife what are you	 3.845789536336554
her own uncle if he had not had a family of his own i and my children	 3.9529113201630146
again over the perverseness of the meeting and his behaviour so	 4.402123043377789
of the surrounding families that he is considered as the rightful	 4.511805325321751
has very much at heart	 3.653104947763526
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did	 3.2914344397076234
mr darcy repeated elizabeth in utter amazement	 3.2926636443392274
by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by	 3.983318657404736
millars regiment went away i thought i should have broke my heart	 3.7371016206472705
decided your character was unfolded in the recital which i received	 4.556168485066439
to oakham mount this morning it is a nice long walk and mr darcy has	 4.63374807287527
it elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed	 4.945203511015506
we were all dancing together at netherfield	 3.2311720099147
it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should	 3.4704214205359483
but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely	 3.464227897766104
declared that they were miserable they solaced their wretchedness	 4.585936839718557
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself	 3.279259980022782
affection every moment more valuable	 3.3184248454027663
standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and	 4.295654392241102
elizabeth smiled	 3.9880604895142966
nothing	 3.18998361683877
this account then is what he has received from mr darcy i am	 3.482429556788032
heard you utter good girl it would vex me indeed to see you again	 3.860563865660183
same lydias going to brighton was all that consoled her for the	 3.89247668690619
to assist mr wickham with money	 3.5044483528302126
elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the	 3.061376941813065
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs bennet got	 3.428784560989504
and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently there has	 4.1231740121507405
i am talking of possibilities charles	 3.3766233134083574
himself	 3.199711893881445
to be so very accomplished as they all are	 4.830761720849447
he readily agreed to it	 3.1821544648481703
all i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it	 3.3099540510281713
oh thensome time or other we shall be happy to hear you our	 3.4566052796874898
will not take comfort in mine believe her to be deceived by all means	 3.2829586075712958
that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as	 3.098759372736419
poor lydia an express came at twelve last night just as we were	 3.3162391195168843
happy i am sure i shant get a wink of sleep all night i knew how it	 4.370340145746596
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of	 3.7177242773125485
you have a very small park here returned lady catherine after a short	 2.9057425292485033
elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her	 4.027837504036251
whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins was convinced that	 3.8656860156194033
despair i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in	 3.8261308917671766
appearance before one came from her books and the other from her	 3.912993391281213
has she been presented i do not remember her name among the ladies at	 3.8020159824145274
agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be	 4.088660536294328
promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument he	 4.063149060652367
it was two or three days before he could get from her what he	 3.419047642390104
to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was	 3.5911220135385755
the loss of her daughter made mrs bennet very dull for several days	 3.4617671197939166
scarcely less eager to meet her again i really do not think georgiana	 3.7856001721098314
the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its	 3.8126977948608216
immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour but	 3.966063304601556
lizzy my dear i want to speak with you	 3.9406840507464267
character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these	 3.7652098038793733
to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three	 3.534225138053008
long as it is possiblei know it cannot be long	 4.798345650836402
chapter v	 1.9302842045940272
that all was safe her wit flowed long	 4.485230356980576
five grown up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own	 3.2824660035775888
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes to	 4.1432943131192035
unhappy there may be error and there may be misery thoughtlessness	 4.539353716838644
think of nothing but of mr wickham and of what he had told her all	 4.063347475512306
exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he	 3.972360824420626
chapter vii	 1.9302842045940272
is less certain	 3.719340640816222
for your sakes we would do any thing lydia my love though you are	 3.6659125004477358
though we know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she	 3.419479426014989
their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing	 3.773861243859811

appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation	 3.4710114903244387
now kitty you may cough as much as you chuse said mr bennet and	 3.4385902381808293
particularly acquainted with my partner at such an assembly as this it	 3.791255447618078
were received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be	 3.7272259286323504
forget because they were not immediately before methese causes	 3.8501736812943523
he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his	 3.125232009303312
discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss	 4.4499990961558
the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made	 3.2224367478571487
happiness	 3.7319823981253473
may convince you of its being one	 4.086465310940677
as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to	 4.215161937351259
lizzy you must not do so you must not suspect me it mortifies me i	 4.287816291456868
there is also one other person in the party he continued after a	 3.0657882237544185
their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly	 3.632304966271502
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord	 5.853029300119124
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the	 3.481494553866863
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe how can you be smiling so	 4.1851026037590735
lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her	 4.3212707806172155
quick in its execution he begged to know farther particulars of what he	 4.240179006714193
himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions	 4.254552261951957
generally known because if it were to get round to the ladys family	 4.2177358369453515
owe you you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most	 3.8512584616432246
those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the	 4.520713959121035
of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made every thing worse	 3.2395476759840967
my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your	 3.665145816449739
hours of separation that must sometimes occur in the absence of jane	 4.845026718284676
intimidate me	 3.1351977684714583
kitty did she very innocently said what is the matter mamma what do	 3.8475042683641774
occasion of dictating to others in the intervals of her discourse with	 5.020581369801274
do you suppose them to be in london	 3.3796243368619185
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the	 3.610800313505128
feeling i am sure you did the turn of your countenance i shall never	 3.8811115498423923
on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing	 3.9736283447817153
about them that he advanced but little whilst wandering on in this	 5.139182868347864
lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingleys	 3.38714898159294
may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public	 4.92943650461831
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that	 3.67145891098803
asked in the course of the evening elizabeth reserved to herself the	 4.004548808618173
you till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your	 3.9653622194579032
between them and if she might judge from his complexion his mind was	 4.257091112118493
left them capable of considering the last half hour with some	 3.23940297733958
was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and	 3.860557591405577
wish he had danced with eliza	 3.5360179857866574
these are home questionsand perhaps i cannot say that i have	 3.318700941130752
smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things	 3.360909966858112
they walked on without knowing in what direction there was too much to	 4.055382375534438
as to a real strong attachment pray how violent was mr bingleys	 3.29204911990645
do for us we do not suffer by accident it does not often happen	 3.4128205147298165
trouble of practising it is not that i do not believe my fingers as	 4.729666552592064
i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time i	 3.9267230077733775
him it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we	 3.8400130635914778
will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of	 3.5376710103431606
laid the foundation it is too long ago i was in the middle before i	 4.50198906714878
nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable kitty and	 3.7366661678606
all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt that	 3.7303823082569347
who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the	 3.5941277207994187
the idea she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her	 3.4449170968157135
will last and what sort of table do they keep charlotte is an	 3.3593927847228318
introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had	 3.586266617593576
he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped to interrupt	 5.026106380116322
of seeing you at pemberley today	 3.733393541468189
was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting both changed colour	 3.210580110520251
mistaken on applying to see the place they were admitted into the	 4.472478495659662
nothing to live on mr darcy asked him why he had not married your	 3.668814498224078
their conduct has been such replied elizabeth as neither you nor	 3.1947537164489113
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages	 3.4280185083895787
for the liveliness of your mind i did	 3.754437679698724
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here	 4.800250845818259
so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear that	 3.688814414771203
hardheartedness in any of the family	 3.764444795555312
good a grace as she could she was not the better pleased with his	 4.706197923383877
something else	 3.7887321301845516
this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of	 3.1819970032324134
and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own	 3.6688809323365303
estate whenever it falls without any selfreproach this matter may be	 3.566704358439467
marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and had	 4.3874021414500435
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her	 3.5845396428067127
she has one only daughter the heiress of rosings and of very	 3.9015459698787684
looked the gentleman but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attention	 3.3545324671206878
can i suppose her so lost to every thingimpossible i grieve to	 3.3788867389618713
mrs bennets schemes for this day were ineffectual bingley was every	 4.060929604351432
how could i ever think her like her nephew said she as she looked in	 3.2496271890638457
too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their	 5.946258681745017
stand up with	 3.2618464470576822
loose to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible	 4.310619817629084
just now when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at	 4.011682761683635
away like other young men	 3.5871364582452663
every body away from him and her daughter elizabeth who had a letter	 3.722151962071642
gutenbergtm electronic works nearly all the individual works in the	 3.8375411625968603

from the shire as clearly as mr gardiner could do but mrs	 4.013268692305959
herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the	 3.4713476302343267
no that i am sure i shall not and i think it was very impertinent of	 4.3141268957058365
but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only mr	 3.185704084618808
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings partyi assure	 4.288177109561951
a most unexpected and serious nature but i am afraid of alarming	 3.9726699540998807
manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we	 3.848325927816444
she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means there were	 3.458662135777181
of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as	 3.441077393530788
to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in	 3.281645285554485
short pause followed this speech and mrs hurst began again	 3.421251023142592
and what arts did he use to separate them	 3.491195791367441
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first	 3.813804475244581
well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what	 3.3304105331042018

particulars immediately following of wickhams resigning all pretensions	 3.524646872373457
his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as shewed an	 3.7377836778145874
forward to as possible at some future time	 3.4103611916418495
in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the	 3.6007254026131466
attention his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling	 3.6374911509410555
old housekeeper i suppose poor reynolds she was always very fond of	 3.9501005817443415
and economy had it been your uncles doing i must and would have	 3.2212485567187037
endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and	 4.3482771280225485
should think highly of himself if i may so express it he has a right	 3.5397359860721815
fixed for the following tuesday the two ladies were delighted to see	 3.583420323610933
place and a camp upon the whole therefore she found what has been	 3.772964247231628
lovely and amiable when darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley	 4.26955321013926
mother went forward to meet her but instead of the expected summons	 3.303544079484699
elizabeths misery increased at such unnecessary such officious	 3.442663688636978
kitty owned that she had rather stay at home darcy professed a great	 4.657505123363075
last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry	 3.6915212731143217
flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be	 3.2515438400310317
father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they	 3.4280989105657667
tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton i owe all that i know	 4.328561956438705
while she staid with us if i had not perceived by janes letter	 4.019761741168648
i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us it was more	 3.155863038771428
she practises very constantly	 3.2405514171376835
application was a something to look forward to	 3.530309061746507
place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been	 3.256197066759533
intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to	 3.9479995634431417
charge for the ebooks unless you receive specific permission if you	 4.106520959158989
pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he	 3.8336137754549786
when he has nothing to do	 3.5541646981918684
time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings and it was now heightened	 5.075582950894048
be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt	 3.5722088459453323
and i have another favour to ask will you come and see me	 3.4271522991690757
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification she went on	 5.168350275807254
you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to	 3.2546385405985148
immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could	 3.230807601822776
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the	 4.6757900342071785
visited them all and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity	 3.9798459480004436
good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said	 3.4965298535971363
jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and	 3.5414511624958895
have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn	 4.754322586371296
had yet learnt to care for at a ball they returned therefore in good	 3.0648151047312173
way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and	 4.408701085140267
replied that he was adding but we expect him tomorrow with a	 4.80145541556879
could i expect it to be otherwise said she yet why did he come	 3.64166424257949
passed took leave and rode on with his friend	 4.006784468389196
cannot afford it and what claims has lydia what attractions has she	 4.031957574242226
go too of all things only think what a miserable summer else we shall	 3.465726110399509
speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrs	 3.684224130104568
gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn	 3.4032238296166093
he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have	 4.113381981309663
what i think	 3.677770412248345
it must have been his sisters doing they were certainly no friends to	 3.188718117056086
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane	 3.7450540833112926
and taking her hand he would have given it to mr darcy who though	 4.355629299949056
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design these	 3.095084430309294
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity	 3.343056967493352
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing	 5.003889123114903
oh my dear mr bennet as she entered the room we have had a most	 3.3961973243716455
more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner mr	 3.134968135700465
mrs philips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest from	 3.934036102825895
opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me that she could	 4.068165902826812
power of reading again i can remember some expressions which might	 3.322413824241965
on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shewn into a very	 4.476640933084617
youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming	 3.6242960578151266
perhaps i am not doing her justice but she is very young she has never	 3.9064809309579887
and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible the comfort to her	 3.2856850029671336
thought he must be sensible himself it was a subject in short on	 3.8547855413385195
but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another	 3.8476772320411263
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a	 3.573383562634497
dinner was on table they left her to vent all her feelings on the	 3.9520218048480253
approach and before she could strike into another path she was	 3.820402620914679
know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we were beyond	 3.7068909599143733
no she would go home i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies for	 4.13077254179744
sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane	 3.5056270224810717
visitor did at last appear but the shortness of her stay and yet more	 3.968853719951126
but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult	 3.3167219739352856
yes very well i saw them the night before last	 3.2938302561056476
she accordingly read and elizabeth who knew what curiosities his	 3.5163477477983762
you did and it was not wholly without foundation you may remember	 3.728014266073887
looks	 4.205153813749768
a way	 4.073309262448463
which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned her eye on	 4.794840393834485
yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly oh jane	 3.486906397703134
wonder elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the	 3.301661715383157
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them any thing was a	 3.3071911444538573
taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the	 4.7549715435953335
oh yesthat that is the worst of all till i was in kent and saw	 4.393432684199854
would mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention	 4.173408672048075
done for your long kind satisfactory detail of particulars but	 4.300774744582258
here again i shall give you painto what degree you only can tell	 3.4317536589409072

the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all	 3.6823968991543663
it is your turn to say something now mr darcyi talked about	 3.2112026557716455
we never had any governess	 3.65939875027746
quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the	 4.671442995560336

when the party broke up lydia returned with mrs forster to meryton	 3.2278375113449234
which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room and	 3.69904544032073
what should not you mind	 3.828055005270095
altogether mr bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and	 3.2611542948869627
elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to	 2.6383473782145295
violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it	 3.63995036917478
after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr wickham	 3.5993655437240766
jane i hope and trust they will yet be happy his consenting to marry	 3.5959678673552147

ten thousand pounds heaven forbid how is half such a sum to be	 3.7201980918867164

removing all my doubts i am not indebted for my present happiness to	 4.472923388304883
you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas but however i hope	 4.381880185104107

on either side that spoke particular regard nothing occurred between	 3.266504165707905
my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these they will	 2.7599122505947955

what did you say of me that i did not deserve for though your	 4.6772812416206975
now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting	 4.21883147117462
but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that	 4.3749924390592785

elizabeth you are not serious now	 3.83367039983368
why does she not come in	 3.688697263505261
his partners oh that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance	 4.591144028079625
verdure of the early trees she was on the point of continuing her walk	 4.365530182469713
certain absolutely certain	 3.6951497324430913
mr gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their	 3.328927107887601
for being so silly	 3.4961575109430423
can have induced him to behave so cruelly	 4.746984551302814
had you then persuaded yourself that i should	 3.5572161621169025
every thing how i long to see her and to see dear wickham too but the	 3.016223748061394
wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the	 3.1645254198018655
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though	 3.987297844734426
should meet	 3.975942060296122

invitation	 4.415797276572721
safe arrival in london and when she wrote again elizabeth hoped it	 3.8453789451523557
her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present	 4.047889144266263
georgiana that morning no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely	 3.1380257383772925
very unexpectedfor your housekeeper she added informed us that	 3.348490760631157
colonel fitzwilliams manners were very much admired at the parsonage	 4.171668641808361
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to	 3.491218089680516
credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more	 5.275385223187613
then who taught you who attended to you without a governess you must	 3.585627278881807
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself since her	 3.9698046085176637
compliment must be all for herself her astonishment however was	 3.505804822438172
assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of	 2.9990920703985418
faults at different times but this is the true one nothing was	 3.2779730035692163
steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and	 3.193110172328382
jane i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get	 3.5596647455594024
integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of mr	 4.332668821355054
will believe me the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent	 3.8905536826976843
more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to	 4.3310991842894575
nothing he may not like to hear	 3.9594585470768644
beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point	 3.340975131689096

was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was	 3.0399022092731522
unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the	 3.623163660992782

of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and	 4.329437488729239
of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of	 3.9546119248230904
dependence when have you been prevented by want of money from going	 3.1843694526760338
sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips	 4.250974931493404
it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had	 4.0764676455821185
spoken so sensibly and observed in a halfwhisper to lady lucas that	 5.695079262421117
not to hear in a doleful voice mrs bennet thus began the projected	 3.648309265682334
while you have been here	 4.223149869336849
expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect	 4.076922691636675
it is more than i engage for i assure you	 4.05143934824158
did he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant and since this sad	 4.044293842529728
she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited	 4.561291936128528
oh no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so	 3.1154381312119885
she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found	 3.547410895147302

she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over	 4.055689720927793
impossible not to long to know	 3.2544758868141086
world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away	 3.1901949138195764
this was a lucky idea of mine indeed said mrs bennet more than	 3.395402300087097
nothing child nothing i did not wink at you she then sat still five	 3.803121884059989
exceedingly bad he had found the law a most unprofitable study	 3.2952316412518163
to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and	 3.826693181412508
been forming a new acquaintance	 3.5643602814716044
one of the gates into the ground	 3.39346285801385
conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will	 3.562205124800376
a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would	 4.338745906861156
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered miss	 3.719691211482555
character connections and situation in life i am convinced that my	 3.440754463668881
many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest	 4.349162906063095
place	 4.068043110350018
and wish him all manner of evil but my feelings are not only cordial	 3.3002782600244704
moreover caught his fancy very much he now seated himself by her and	 3.690746064730822
from their aunt at present indeed they were well supplied both with	 3.2103912397083776
elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books	 3.0535733886606717
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated	 3.483885300025529
assurances of speedy payment for which i have pledged myself and	 4.518658109233232
amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no	 3.3968013336514535
yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine	 3.6588272513167657
you must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon mature	 3.4815755471488914
girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is	 3.5608063098562095

asked her for the two next then the two third he danced with miss	 3.7272492874042293

or five thousand a year what a fine thing for our girls	 3.4188432775625643
particularly hurts me i will have no reserves from you mr darcy	 3.9171442546176585
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most	 3.7936808899036247
that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for	 3.649874977069745
abroad were less varied than before and at home she had a mother and	 3.810166768610851
a day or two since we first cameand yet how many things have	 2.994802726695178
of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself he was a tall	 4.490704465191523
should now escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope of	 3.8001964552919603
i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a	 3.936085322706901
sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a	 5.1513624486530665
more agitated voice that i might have prevented iti who knew	 3.655697768380789
i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if	 2.9416687155254095
but before they heard again from mr gardiner a letter arrived for	 3.3789700492197077
dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house	 3.7710878697603754
by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she	 3.8259918965315753
with a stronger voice she soon added i have this comfort immediately	 3.370675456208983
another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to	 5.3669073102422225
a creature as ever livedand her nieces are very pretty behaved girls	 3.557787631248395
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful	 3.504768611836722

this young man will influence her we live in so different a part of	 3.2076043881992096
indeed i had what will you think of my vanity i believed you to be	 3.299604233571162
signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however	 3.3669194051829647
what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation cried he do	 3.3928164723805074
exquisite	 1.9356690691114107
will see a finer larger picture of him than this this room was my late	 4.000035079098075

moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the	 4.028807014450837
she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to	 4.292236431098532
dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away	 3.505740423071354
quarrel about the past in future i hope we shall be always of one	 4.054624129937299
pens remarkably well	 3.2569693124669548
minutes in which they continued together were some of the most	 3.9013083305861334
astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of	 3.2115377014574817
elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking	 3.265305062092946
trademark owner and any distributor under this agreement will not be	 3.639671093623102
humoured girl but as emptyheaded as himself had nothing to say that	 3.876463463950527
that i may have it tomorrow	 3.557303096755778
jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to	 4.050202379643504
then turning to mr bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at	 4.410927535192747
by introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she	 4.21644114351091
you may be sure of my pardon	 3.3486677340238513
to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she	 3.7397342202139545
mr darcys letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart she	 3.397373878269013
want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel	 4.474175294906357
missing him she really rejoiced at it colonel fitzwilliam was no	 3.4646240850375674
unassuming and gentle elizabeth who had expected to find in her as	 3.6225820065630527
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt	 5.119247332752043
remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself	 3.9846736828008527
was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to	 4.206325883828002
fun herewhat do you think has happened this morningmr collins has	 3.650240898032408
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up	 4.504460956564032
forgotten there was really a great air of comfort throughout and by	 3.486101704805609
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity mr collinss present	 4.819030199439895
1813	 1.9356690691114107
maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern	 3.738065476249011
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcys marriage but as she	 4.454600029510595
some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course	 5.697445353037905
over it immediately it had better have happened to you lizzy you	 3.411543856507389
if elizabeth when mr darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to	 3.5676989305577824
onesbut now we may be silent	 3.784580576058241
world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of any body i only	 3.912907189449737
in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh	 4.227240438368574
twelvemonth happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance if	 3.096941550075254
were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his	 3.481455126012971
friend how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so	 3.4663220403623805
i have an excessive regard for jane bennet she is really a very sweet	 3.0573474780381793
language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time	 3.5943751646504616
she was engaged one day as she walked in reperusing janes last	 3.3201181763505487
me to unfold to any human being having said thus much i feel no	 3.734288709656411
reverse there is a mixture of servility and selfimportance in his	 3.791165536403834
welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to	 3.4063165031501357
of fingering though her taste is not equal to annes anne would have	 3.9526135821221544
wickham he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and	 3.9132751482652526
hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology	 4.5098501981929155
marrying him	 4.24093985120341
even elizabeth began to fearnot that bingley was indifferentbut that	 4.518843178570922
all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must yet	 3.4214722729855302
to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certain true he	 4.333386837562997
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for his	 3.7242698238602343
remembered to you and her motheryours c	 3.672259547201217
nearly three weeks	 3.366776362267209
not adequate to the risk	 3.695863014854948

section 2 information about the mission of project gutenbergtm	 3.3728434451122182
nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of	 3.981625824239374
she could not think of darcys leaving kent without remembering that	 3.5899891924414544
the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly on	 3.9575525920197054
perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to	 4.130654417058988
illtreatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite	 3.619325836999146
say voluntarily to elizabeth	 3.7101496228241406
another intreaty that she would be serious however produced the	 3.7964910721628153
school and an establishment formed for her in london and last	 3.4512075238226725
may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth	 3.1037094127454594
similarity in the turn of our mindswe are each of an unsocial	 3.4598008558098035
mrs bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some	 3.3755343247951703
and luckily for the others the business of lovemaking relieved them	 4.459695341459744
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of	 4.108184765062116
solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and every thing	 4.144369315498153
as the rattle of the chaise elizabeth loved absurdities but she had	 4.447063916227468
particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of	 3.8314962212151573
collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of	 3.1357865628374815
back her ladyship was highly incensed	 3.755644778139137
my dear harriet	 3.04527379300325

likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken	 4.040809970449789
unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined she respected she	 4.131923949595332
undoubtedly did you see him while you were at lambton i thought i	 3.9613508892481586

fighting tell him what a dreadful state i am inthat i am frightened	 4.074432105286779
materially affected by the difference her sisters situation remained	 3.918933356292271
i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have	 3.9114210209607196
perfectly soi thank you	 3.4559025358346993
one looked white the other red mr wickham after a few moments	 4.35626237100521
victory over him continued her triumph	 3.3696308245076243
family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your	 3.693003498081662
i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship you	 3.809526704982688
what is it you mean	 3.254016577387887
acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect	 3.6364707420079414
education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend	 3.713668753069316
power to dance with others in vain did she entreat him to stand up with	 4.21581879622055
dear lizzy pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before i	 3.6150645911745376
required of you is to assure to your daughter by settlement her	 3.6694642002083935
she is saving enough there is nothing extravagant in their	 3.7617098441311
to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together after	 3.923903171122582
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined with amazement did	 4.569335658317217
handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks	 3.971100662405406
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as	 4.379416337117778

sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that	 3.077505505301538
wickham and herself jane listened with astonishment and concernshe	 3.0443247348026587

not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her	 4.695728411845756

my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request	 3.169083312428979
they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself	 3.979587224335481
kind of supposition which had appeased mrs bennets curiosity and	 3.5941126077734404

him too little to care for his approbation	 3.6946012854647683
a point should admit of doubt but really i know not what to say	 3.641621955092304
have you any other objection said elizabeth than your belief of my	 2.8637128431727144
must deaden them more mr darcys behaviour astonished and vexed her	 3.344777343872162
the generality of female minds but i confess they would have no charms	 4.34815786783569
but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfathers	 3.4390559011025648
ambition will ever be gratified i came to try you i hoped to find you	 3.286264267885662
indeed cried wickham with a look which did not escape her and pray	 4.073452134759534
i hope you will consent to be of the party indeed eliza you will be	 3.561006271781871

all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of	 3.0659993133265813
he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring i had not	 3.853001078260028
when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabeth	 3.3855636013696673
wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks this	 3.503127725764488
all the unhappiness she had brought on her family if she heard me	 4.287983751162737
of either lady catherine or her daughter colonel fitzwilliam had called	 3.451191031987169
for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes but the case is	 3.7474808542666405
and made the important communication its effect was most	 5.149506346034007
for me i should infinitely prefer a book	 4.911276226615499
agreeable	 3.696480983901017
and a book was produced but on beholding it for every thing announced	 3.624440744504042

if you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth colouring	 3.400469497878353

far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general i	 4.199448076431721
his fear of discovery by lydias relations for it had just transpired	 3.9119870719389835
should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to	 3.2396065163468912
distinguished no part of the scene her thoughts were all fixed on that	 3.7134076151714805
would be wisdom to resist all that i can promise you therefore is not	 3.7840392663814164

satisfactory to tell you mr bingley does not know the whole of his	 3.401686900142939
alarms being now removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of	 3.250232300013094
of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness	 3.317525738063061
patchedup business at the expence of your father and uncles and is	 4.262271078672671

ready to believe for every bodys sake that she may feel something	 3.3792663925511617
to play and sing before any body and every bodyif my vanity had taken	 3.9785501938164973
in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting	 2.969096331948899
laugh as much as you chuse but you will not laugh me out of my	 3.711739208099392
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or	 3.937306108202026
so much both of mr darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was	 4.069323263356686
appearance of it	 3.4142105872865565
with a look of doubt	 3.2283776039390397
engagement mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment	 4.920937070430582
sisters we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to	 4.259329593225805
it is not true a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood	 3.397874029953819
gutenbergtm work the foundation makes no representations concerning	 3.842709019884752
sure she can have no objectioncome kitty i want you up stairs and	 3.5710821367421106
forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow	 3.3331049686077816
and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of	 4.1001773557339005
but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in	 3.095014054221888
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them	 3.57129227912932
satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante	 3.2324976616921735
and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his	 3.7098252539925496
master and his sister	 4.06231199083773
what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and mr	 3.7367234729690146
engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of	 2.7981258608157646
then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of	 3.253377079143946
well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not	 4.327355192363557
pemberley you blamed me for coming	 4.505559335079396
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the project	 3.6873890856250444
this was his plan of amendsof atonementfor inheriting their fathers	 4.840146189596055
fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that	 3.403688259434969
letter she wrote also with great pleasure of her brothers being an	 3.292728469061965
in the church and his cousin could have none at all	 3.897255546300963
very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was	 4.164105548731404
was not unwelcome for its own sake the journey would moreover give her	 3.180640134020808
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me	 4.184901139664564
countenance such an openness and gentleness in his manner	 4.526583891303108
looked almost wild	 3.652453786873015
departure she observed	 3.1575976234050294
i should not mind any thing at all	 3.090763311179306
opened his lips the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was	 4.610381964048359
obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour	 3.31960693703046
had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity	 3.566475553980198
but you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviour as	 4.385134501684376
welcome relief to him at rosings and mrs collinss pretty friend had	 3.8045157993335104
and intelligence which might supply it among themselves if there were	 3.379901131860206
ago	 4.889384334411178
exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them because wickham has	 3.4778763768245855
miss lucas and herself	 3.61618364879357
things that you can do with most project gutenbergtm electronic works	 3.1954160259360163
such terms	 4.166686488879771
there was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her	 3.564257621716123
somebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid	 3.4257418928321823
flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of	 3.348522809291545
will be renamed	 2.921909918579717
vol iii	 2.0857370267093605
distrust and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she	 4.038196264298236
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by	 5.230908823283376
of fun the other day at colonel forsters kitty and me were to spend	 3.715434539438007
all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydia determined if	 3.7217141099330284
like regard and esteem for our cousin	 4.238827757550127
comprehend what i must feel and i rely upon his goodness	 3.877194481702718
kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without	 4.01947653966944
may we take my uncles letter to read to her	 3.3073773499025356
affair became public	 3.6411636716113924
watchfulness has been effectual and though i should certainly be a more	 4.401880283209995
mr darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other	 3.46527334903438
happiness no no let me shift for myself and perhaps if i have very	 3.8914434129700175
mr bingley followed his advice mr darcy walked off and elizabeth	 3.014355149991973
to part us if he were so they could not succeed by supposing such an	 4.013366316761289
friendless and who was actually staying in his colonels family that i	 3.8019165059682836
time make their past imprudence forgotten	 4.331583292949184
when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose	 3.629636405607196
observances which he supposed a regular part of the business on finding	 3.7247081400874604
heartily they were wished away by some of the family mrs hurst and her	 3.811395515274576
substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on	 4.294284387233295
chapter xi	 1.9302842045940272
in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on	 3.1518249979256567
have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is but now it comes out	 2.921382205437628
take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the	 3.818295836070458
but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the	 4.180871947453296
painful than elizabeths but whatever she felt she was desirous of	 4.095928133466126
respects there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for	 4.715522525802308
the world and every body hoped that he would never come there again	 3.8526853841807243
elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude	 3.6730792512685073
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the	 3.717875622336636
mrs hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed	 4.104985574905622
that the chimneypiece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all	 4.988984721385542
to say the truth i was too cross to write you supposed more than	 3.6154005690735262
should not have known her again	 3.7141539898550326
my news it is about dear wickham too good for the waiter is not it	 4.139696753074191
consequence of any reply mr collins might never make the offer and	 3.1519837105023196
that she did not always know when she was silent	 4.021615965827572
your relations	 3.933822364040451
you have a house in town i conclude	 3.2999682056639363
catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves	 3.6172802375430995
mr collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife	 2.9232414128755284
less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now	 3.4529141787072373
oh but the gentlemen will have mr bingleys chaise to go to meryton	 3.412862879508564
far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with	 4.367010345715818
slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of	 4.5858107671395025
easily learnt had never been his design he confessed himself	 3.9198049878025967
before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy	 4.2035558898831225
connubial felicity really was an union of a different tendency and	 4.4826068695409695
sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the	 3.5117891702625412
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss	 4.751967561192545
restrain her astonishment from being visible never even in the company	 3.2247914164446554
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more	 3.2183994325518115
never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth	 3.444346506569419
bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn	 5.048873321149111
of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at	 3.3336836861114927
family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that	 3.5151575418207415
and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings	 3.1861652456960083
netherfield long enough she attracted him more than he likedand miss	 4.072004590250984
had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended	 3.9696119291841048
elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any	 3.1457056000333483
fitzwilliams words and these strong objections probably were her	 3.194427888060641
for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so	 4.467848390816792
ask for compassion her home and her housekeeping her parish and her	 4.316612904593472
contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those	 3.377935931290005
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the	 4.573409251680656
much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be	 3.5399367082802
had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday several of	 4.605567174124797
elizabeth was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on seeing	 3.059617258425974
insensibility of danger security for happiness	 3.265459371370695
they were just returned from the library where such and such officers	 3.0068774125202617
you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew	 3.4573571848613684
the men shant come and part us i am determined we want none of them	 3.288982409878814
markettown where the family did not visit it was acknowledged	 2.9541427457839182

project gutenbergtm is synonymous with the free distribution of	 4.366936185421462
darcy did not wish for cards and mr hurst soon found even his open	 3.88288617197209
if one could but go to brighton observed mrs bennet	 3.4742583102635143
you begin to comprehend me do you cried he turning towards her	 2.939865277208537
you need not distress yourself the moral will be perfectly fair lady	 3.4569904543240955
overcome had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture	 4.5989389439810795
who i believe will soon become a part of the family	 3.6055155061595836
imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must	 3.397170576614429
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real	 3.6332923341709606
could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easiness	 3.077633229017524
courted you therei have saved you the trouble of accounting for it	 4.475143135548274
suddenly got up and saying to kitty	 3.49897834574205
feelings though fervent were little displayed and that there was a	 4.229150879348745
hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill	 3.6479489977728448
uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the	 4.652922893560917
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run	 3.735196077000939
darcy had walked away to another part of the room she followed him with	 3.9007736246299647
i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly	 3.642938611119362
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious	 3.7094848474155824
herself	 3.188408201310134
gracechurchstreet monday	 2.0857370267093605
yes very different but i think mr darcy improves on acquaintance	 3.8057374387401413
i will do my best	 3.421296290877484
i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age	 3.8875446916323053
perhaps probablebut his regard did not appear to me enough	 3.261666128223232
and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever	 4.126707955341951
conversation with colonel forster	 3.2211458829326243
were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect	 4.2027171162955135
mr collins had only to change from jane to elizabethand it was soon	 4.221308839836343
which i have never acknowledged allowing the case however to stand	 3.8612606865916868
cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen he begged	 4.067040049351811
which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without	 3.5323339142365637
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield the visit	 3.710311747069732
acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should	 3.6514703272306184
warranties of any kind express or implied including but not limited to	 4.408775702724727
rain and then you must stay all night	 3.159715450589688
professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable	 4.057824544946254
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeths performance mixing	 3.6733827866067363
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine	 3.82075462386948
that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she	 3.3603410234270674
electronic work you indicate that you have read understand agree to	 3.458064218886154
wickham what a good joke it will be i can hardly write for	 4.3180917160236065
his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and	 3.210316047152317
acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was in fact	 3.8425065935795697
was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was	 4.592556774455375
saw any thing of it to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle	 3.9855940787991604
how strange cried elizabeth how abominablei wonder that the very	 3.391385463799332
miss elizabeth bennet repeated miss bingley i am all astonishment	 3.2310089555836687

give which a just sense of shame would not conceal with a strong	 3.647060287124162

while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart	 3.3519343971479945
governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of	 3.835225091823862

she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a	 4.075949880203187

to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may	 5.179519850357489
to hope that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire the day	 2.899630344872459

as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance but though	 4.988438820160089
suppose to believe them fond of each other	 3.148520611820862
going thither but charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan	 4.241949885932311
being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and mrs	 4.838989380602039
she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on	 4.816303791416044
knowing what she did she accepted him he walked away again	 3.6978614656809192

grantleys	 1.9356690691114107
in this interference from what she had said of her resolution to	 3.800178043879525
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means	 3.030603807130207
somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham	 4.295312853170745
him but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that	 3.78758516171672

opinion it is really too great a violation of decency honour and	 4.254046128471627
him cannot have a proper way of thinking you shall not defend her	 3.6467962458447913

studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all	 4.330542008020716
bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to rail	 4.124000593843604

was not exactly like her own but she could not have supposed it	 3.7143128456655705
apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be	 3.286514575949565

pemberley from her might be mischievously construed her colour	 5.3057385965104595
in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away	 3.0274020627012006
her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally	 3.6167272782757145
would be gone with such celerity your conduct would be quite as	 3.63089352562136
each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the	 4.312519565119075
a constant state of change if you are outside the united states check	 3.599818918244434
thousand tender recollections his behaviour to myself has been	 4.024301843924003
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish self reproach she could find	 5.612376417043921
to complete the favourable impression she then told him what mr darcy	 3.476194375858294

protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman	 5.38468298568038
upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for	 2.7687066698354714
elizabeth made no answer she was afraid of talking longer of his	 3.0754732908717717
her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with	 4.827095275533688
as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great	 3.4822936469932815
such a study in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined	 4.020525068189729
brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my fathers	 3.602133602504966
forster it will be quite a shame if he does not	 3.976576429157905
more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the	 3.1725164080900603
you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into	 3.3606851198950753
directly	 3.4115114131070525
what an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was	 3.6167234677139057
brilliancy and her features are not at all handsome her nose wants	 4.015036169385459
fathers intentions you will hardly blame me for refusing to	 3.8994450820265785
relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different	 4.13046004489046
eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it he added that mr	 5.09741004286319
she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked	 4.728401398801935
condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if	 4.480341176737316
perfectly ignorant of what had happened they went to the library	 3.589861829413913
wait in the drawingroom and whose shyness as they had not seen her	 4.193201215470595
manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any	 5.0107452356715765
a father acknowledged the whole to me you may imagine what i felt	 3.286889476543519
him you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence	 4.063379064485665
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr	 2.9770224304513153
who have been kept aloof by lydias folly	 3.5365323504081836
bennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle	 3.7766046798190294
mannerone whom his father had promised to provide forit is	 3.4249310042840366
her fellowtravellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think	 4.079247619835617

of their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it was	 3.8710407955835553
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords exclaiming	 3.649609818879589
is very pretty but i thought i might as well buy it as not i shall	 3.842697273260509
at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about	 3.6529010109485
lawn it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the	 3.9043289986170633
if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield	 3.338353796026384
and how i acted regard for my sisters credit and feelings	 3.3637265643880707
been well looked after i always thought they were very unfit to have	 3.620515310605284
extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others	 3.168679610652169
not the smallest hope it is every way horrible	 3.396455648302982
mistaken indulgence towards such a girloh how acutely did she now	 4.429646574638501
subject as usual elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their	 3.3691373278658237
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements mrs	 4.0211227314151685
unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a	 4.183725249650902
give them as unstudied an air as possible	 3.8542249879801256
she said as he walked up and down the street and had mr wickham	 4.179308143340718
alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed	 5.086040602179468
the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the	 3.9845324776006112
paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected on the	 3.7162422560011112
unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often	 3.213021172183619
venture near her lest she might hear too much when they sat down to	 3.4369982444622083
to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me	 3.9201830239263624
but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so	 4.510740441344244
next morning to london	 3.315130407656796
womanly and graceful she was less handsome than her brother but there	 3.332269623061035
collinss side and as many bows on sir williams they departed as	 4.222301036421432
unwillingly said so miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only	 4.15784231557483
imagine that you are gratifying mine	 4.279064873582481
elizabeths astonishment was beyond expression she stared coloured	 3.57536100845377
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner but do you think she	 3.610749389506249
success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine	 3.9051961326216
bingley vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her	 3.3338169367707016
mr collinss triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete	 3.5102286908885967
in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently	 4.087420307465798
head and sat down without saying a word elizabeth had mentioned her	 3.3224825375405898
going away myself	 3.7118405377265535
vain and nonsensical as i knew i had oh how i wanted you	 4.241500993676285
she had chosen	 3.1658008697385562
work of the morning and pack her trunk afresh	 4.332940396573996
him often and after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man	 4.599325791854345
achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i	 3.766160593766959
moment alighted from his horse or his carriage she blushed again and	 4.193446989046139
better looking it is what every body says i do not trust my own	 3.9208539184230986
when the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to elizabeth	 3.833019894650158
with every body and had so many favourites	 3.520969967281521
character i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes but he is a	 3.393828638781402
commendation to think of her as he chose	 3.505302642761539
and i certainly never shall give it i am not to be intimidated into	 3.805759768073991
every attempt of mrs bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a	 3.472420766014533
any thing	 3.080984012017465
interest but nothing to justify enquiry	 3.8644816503711694
cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my	 4.126527526827525
together as to what is to be done	 3.7467540524926664
father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their	 3.4446515192829152
history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have	 3.3793103653708125
us as soon as you returned i have not forgot you see and i assure	 4.501088093006901
inmate of mr darcys house and mentioned with raptures some plans of	 3.4043444734734476
impertinence your uncle is as much surprised as i amand nothing	 3.6272299280306535
awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage	 4.662244263430314
if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which	 3.850878108696708
in her nature however to increase her vexations by dwelling on them	 4.718985028081447
this and all associated files of various formats will be found in	 5.435245192697144
returned to his civil enquiries after her family amazed at the	 3.9037112900551936
ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening	 5.352584853939943
collinses live very comfortable do they well well i only hope it	 3.3080207897577325
chapter xi	 1.9302842045940272
i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short	 3.757163129632361
thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be	 5.0635967731076255
accepting it is not it so mrs bennet	 3.4616313252584754
true said mr bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of	 4.435278207579744
lasting convenience of that kind but perhaps his sister does as well	 3.6354926898970126
estate and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility and	 3.63000445407368
female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the	 4.013233730842482
make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she	 3.9377805689484218
could not be seen and mr darcy found on further enquiry that	 4.256800208957148
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be	 3.8016690939277744
she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far	 4.5424249776251076
him whether he intended to accept mr bingleys invitation and if he	 3.346983250149807
she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some ones	 4.3895934753213455
strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so	 4.28315621108545
little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded	 4.107926529310365
when we are better acquainted	 3.5609287944347034
by other men you had better return to your partner and enjoy her	 3.494265557827132
assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could	 5.0106776117741685
i do not knowi hope there wasbut to be guarded at such a time is	 3.8316899921394003
and if he does colonel forster will hire him my aunt told me so	 3.4715153847010924
acquaintance	 3.6890798457875613
told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you	 4.235931685413182
yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension	 3.2230147844702177
ever had any thing from him except a few presents well i am so happy	 4.083816940452866
i flatter myself that my present overtures of goodwill are highly	 4.7409870312552895
you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy	 3.419246747437433
insolent girl said elizabeth to herselfyou are much mistaken if	 3.5062477797783904
remain freely available for generations to come in 2001 the project	 3.8548418632098436
your written explanation the person or entity that provided you with	 4.196502440834422
sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon	 3.990166731649785
quickness than her sisters	 3.539948889854776
having slighted one of her daughters	 3.0755974937968036
the executors of my fathers will has been unavoidably acquainted	 3.8284068110450393
distressed himself a small sum could not do all this	 4.371814020796927
you are quite a visit in my debt mr bingley she added for when	 3.7434911471315795
when one has a motive only three miles i shall be back by dinner	 3.4211240338647624
that mr collins wants to marry lizzy	 3.6334993373925064
yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement	 3.4193023061084533
bestowed it most unwillingly i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any	 4.074255968893055
elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply	 3.9450650956717253
the bridge and perceived their distance from the house mrs gardiner	 3.1918347636767046
oh no said elizabeth in essentials i believe he is very much	 4.012695263004382
was her only alternative she declared her resolution	 3.4716604401562323
otherwise explained	 3.9189296571414727
cambric and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders had	 4.635266742438273
features though not plain were insignificant and she spoke very	 4.26230057381407
in charlottes did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence	 4.393719860115971
attentions of the officers to whom her uncles good dinners and her own	 4.162856518428611
afraid you will be angry	 3.9766258498851523
upon this information they instantly passed through the hall once more	 3.185062098569118
his concern at having been prevented by business they then went away	 3.117412204428229
temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day when	 3.761570658814458
told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter	 3.3533902075076933
else gave way before the hope of janes being in the fairest way for	 4.398051339176981
against your will against your reason and even against your character	 3.2037100508346046
of course she will be always at pemberley with you	 4.056507623945382
in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had	 3.588321460397898
and down the room in earnest meditation his brow contracted his air	 4.718379976149276
give him a good name some people call him proud but i am sure i never	 3.606167116399531
mrs reynoldss respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this	 3.7190781323504214
but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see	 3.60279552795044
as his marriage was fixed on and i think you will agree with me	 3.7741920159482554
there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did	 3.628753874632095
did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was	 3.58615209785049
concurrence	 1.9356690691114107
every body says that he is ate up with pride and i dare say he had	 3.8033509959305243
into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his	 4.998823244651649
in a few minutes mrs bennet half opened the door and called out	 3.062234888929121
of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the	 3.7797513501838056
the winter and concluded with her brothers regret at not having had	 4.304093367472011
mr fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud illnatured	 3.66156765209419
yes indeed cried mrs bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a	 3.7348694897277315
him he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he	 4.171496618838342
fixed them on her more and more cheerfully	 3.6899291181419014
the officersand if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to	 4.21650101899974
for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the	 3.2815613636546552
even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave	 3.2221817326538327
assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenbergtms	 4.724970700596258
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partneryou	 3.302980889912654
refreshment but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely	 3.6538486969407162
she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell	 4.589502562497258
all she does not yet leave her dressingroom mary and kitty thank	 3.6113262484652697
what do you think she said besides ah mrs bennet we shall have her	 3.390590471792944
being acceptable	 3.09048015583628
daughter he protested that she should receive from him no mark of	 4.300318740095306
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent your profusion	 3.490252132617838
disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her	 3.2931159925850584
without anger such treatment but sir williams good breeding carried	 3.7511891947691534
done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem her	 3.459934565758124
believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from	 3.559851290953918
read and had all the masters that were necessary those who chose to be	 3.711516197079409
favourable answer jane was by no means better the sisters on hearing	 3.4433002995586097
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again the promised	 3.481910426474037
sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in	 3.6156395817554845
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to	 3.399716762420062
a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent	 4.114197429776254
compressed marked up nonproprietary or proprietary form including any	 4.105127406280231
towards mr wickham i know not in what manner under what form of	 3.5932179431552194
not comprise what i have to tell you i must confess myself	 3.705599696095504
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no	 4.421740084789777
must have witnessed that his two sisters and mr darcy however should	 4.096127119593611
health mr collins was also in the same state of angry pride elizabeth	 3.9642351922224344
and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every	 4.452817546864625
gutenbergtm license when you share it without charge with others	 3.0440719861449197
in the house by the end of next week	 3.61167205964622
with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her	 3.3443596315897004
when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go	 3.485303571933408
reporting some fresh instance of wickhams extravagance or irregularity	 4.113908048828476
hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news	 3.4691487253829583

the death of darcys father five years before it was yet in his power	 3.109402995548871
i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied	 3.316395254723223
the better of himself she read over her aunts commendation of him	 4.148545808784375
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for	 4.727438793469465
received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his	 4.134330259845775
compared with some families i believe we were but such of us as	 3.767421856038835
fairbanks ak 99712 but its volunteers and employees are scattered	 4.001971881689426
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but mr collins	 3.6807848121404314
yes almost every day	 3.6275863849980508
elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief and the other that	 4.048686941065938
that is to say you had given your permission i guessed as much and	 3.4695775768803987
only six with him from london his five sisters and a cousin and when	 3.5310057032966515
when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the card tables	 3.238910572781898
elizabeth half expected mr bingley to do he was able to bring darcy	 3.5373526540681066
would make you sonay were your friend lady catherine to know me i	 3.733168634965389
yes where else can they be so well concealed	 3.348419465176207
and not a note not a line did i receive in the mean time when	 3.9305644487492093
than any other person	 4.196694525058897
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the	 4.756262006526863
successful love for mrs bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule	 3.5833060939896337

meryton was within a walk of longbourn they would be going there for	 3.3034213519056523
opportunity of dancing a reel	 3.3115417771815245

remarked he meant to make enquiries at clapham if he could any how	 3.703176752027122
all young ladies accomplished my dear charles what do you mean	 3.8823720091674523
agreeable he would have talked to mrs long but i can guess how it was	 4.078845177817975
and her children should go to london at the same time that mr bennet	 3.5462252063905275
last night names facts every thing mentioned without ceremonyif it	 3.7128173963019226

i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in	 3.0997026719613054
yours ever	 3.876601807918481
eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once	 4.289559180621886
from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally	 3.596089594064336
indulgent as to let him come to us again	 3.284877345027535
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr wickham when	 4.387470099861018

husbands what a pity it is mamma we did not all go	 4.916874602354441

in spite of her deeplyrooted dislike she could not be insensible to	 4.122270936827522
it and could not help saying so	 3.7648542167161834
contrary he was all attention to every body by nature inoffensive	 3.3200136396895283
pemberley	 3.3041427633130875
shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to	 4.274088731552273
idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is	 3.6508676001098563
that is charming three daughters married ten thousand a year oh	 3.063310943596644
have been said and silence was very awkward she wanted to talk but	 3.6978778908829097
proud without being vain pride relates more to our opinion of	 3.308702918893065
mind charlotte tried to console her	 3.5940364114077163
different sort of men and that he hates me	 4.510410606392514
if we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we may	 3.305964463285023
evening party and he bore with the illjudged officiousness of the	 4.306718800620582
about a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject	 4.070734786620479
farther	 4.056535011846743
more than we had and the consciousness of this was another	 4.5383312219394405
it is not mr bingley said her husband it is a person whom i	 3.876726092712086
very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings and	 3.4129000036987893
soon married to mr bingleyit was an animating subject and mrs	 3.684738295155911
and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to	 4.176625562982163
almost took from me my faculties	 3.6622225159437174
she was still full of indignation but when she considered how unjustly	 3.5483207915622796
continued with little intermission to the very day of lydias leaving	 4.638553592159259
blind to miss bingleys inattention after waiting at home every morning	 4.174633408279635
her a very good sort of girl there can be no love in all this my	 3.6314833424737802
oh dearyescertainlyi am sure lizzy will be very happyi am	 3.669170096786738
shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness lady	 3.52995835253534
nonsensical to come at all why must she be scampering about the	 3.40281210784732
aunt it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he	 3.6713257942694573
reasonable young woman but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i	 3.8908780668297043
deserving her mothers reproach prevented his feeling any regret	 3.261297057173032
we may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as	 3.6879807452824687
if your master would marry you might see more of him	 3.3519836962872467
her for a woman who had already refused him as able to overcome a	 4.064701061441506
settled they were to be off as soon as possible but what is to be	 4.295665972947162
one morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two	 3.5222517928432935
she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind	 4.812753375040399
elizabeth did not know what to make of it had she not seen him in	 3.739172474426792
i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an	 3.0490162621792427
librarytheir father was in neither and they were on the point of	 3.348890889507453
miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing mr darcy in any	 4.9508561053947435
are removed of course we hope that you will support the project	 4.147433902310864

attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them	 3.2366947606264356
breathing port wine who followed them into the room	 3.5205754081312652
not yet replied jane but now that my dear uncle is come i hope	 3.4649901892927346
is nothing the matter with me i am quite well i am only distressed by	 3.6809865435843023
that will atone for such wretchedness as this let me never see either	 3.9895592703250005
gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth and	 3.7831707008252855
nonsense	 1.9356690691114107
disagreeable	 3.0214350255985782
saying your opinion of him is sunk we must not be so ready to fancy	 3.8377958984744036
pair of ponies would be the very thing but i must write no more	 4.075727603851877
of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger	 4.475490863118049

after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was	 3.335677056238281
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object there	 3.8142115662585683
one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so	 2.7681466071288354
but my father cannothe wrote last week to hurry my return	 3.0094091717720004

siryou will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching	 3.7651218062611207
hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again today	 3.5338934225629366
on the very last day of the regiments remaining in meryton he dined	 4.992075862374001
the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge	 3.968570883720186
do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in	 3.4646048547703407
were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i	 3.783883470499202
any wish of doing him justice he expressed no regret for what he had	 3.155387218142168
herself such was miss lucass scheme and appearances were so	 3.7245661901948024
farther to wish	 3.9699018854423445
wanted to counteract her mothers schemes	 3.764539831819965
been for her own perverseness he made her an offer in this very room	 3.6570762684025975
thing in his power to satisfy us on this head but on second thoughts	 3.45441506487069
inconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity	 4.394823973407801
this was not very consoling to mrs bennet and therefore instead of	 4.058865272554507
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn and what with the philipses	 3.683614945075143
satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the	 3.258054628140204
i would not be so fastidious as you are cried bingley for a	 4.182952218898914
but it had not been so in derbyshire there he had talked to her	 3.2794498541405486
feelings followed them in silence she was overpowered by shame and	 4.004341009190577
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane	 3.2668273815632136
such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not	 4.134375124613113
this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure	 4.654692101814421
turned silently away mrs bennet who fancied she had gained a complete	 3.997448739780236
de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will	 5.659761547447337
walk to meryton she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist	 4.406460927523333
darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth	 3.2058950777246844

you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with	 3.311530283367743
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned	 3.57898739338418
at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted	 3.637754319985148
she is my youngest girl but one my youngest of all is lately married	 3.20980792687141

manhe is a great friend of darcys	 3.4839883905255626
for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he	 3.6490094707383047
thousand pounds or any thing like it has been advanced he has	 3.911986192957705
curiosity to see the view from the mount and elizabeth silently	 4.491576736926667
prejudiced absurd	 2.0857370267093605
disposition and talents would most suit her his understanding and	 3.5574109424937563

oh my dear eliza pray make haste and come into the diningroom for	 3.9530182892711645
second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasant it	 4.988594948937472

the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison	 3.586172280650305

made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the	 4.817364045168205

the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she	 4.5201689669694245
i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate if it was	 3.7769563031214735
and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the	 3.487854408464546
another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his	 4.091038554755977
this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter said	 3.012994268999187
she is a most charming young lady indeed lady catherine herself says	 3.2176186111249607
such a flutter that i am sure i cant write so i will dictate and you	 4.322391375364174
at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few	 3.8237729744267415
has done no harm to any one but myself	 4.160221211449616
charlotte wisely did not hear after sitting long enough to admire every	 3.7898346381090673
interferingand elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and	 3.262856018724092
lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a	 3.3524484120709275
and that i suppose is one of your sisters	 3.6667106739815525
consolation to such distressbut i will not torment you with vain	 3.927766099348822
calling her attention this observation would not have prevented her	 3.7076734810208665
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by	 3.5243057164902774
as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side miss	 3.2536408412332345

longbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general	 5.354259814877232
i have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to his being	 3.3141285010976373
as it was the express was sent off to longbourn but our visitor	 3.377723289504043
shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight	 3.893890353568345
to hope before i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that	 3.317662374296646
ones own daughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr	 3.4327443207508503
liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a	 3.7989155660604603
i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation	 3.8253019165564193
tears in her eyes that a sisters sense of decency and virtue in such	 4.244534059330801
nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side	 3.2904022212642023
economy and other amiable qualifications	 3.2279902733630745
had said enough to keep him quiet	 3.510845669344289
confusion and unable to lift up her eyes had miss bingley known what	 3.1869023387820494
she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see	 3.581918420789269
inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved mrs gardiner and	 4.08406279339934
la you are so strange but i must tell you how it went off we were	 3.8537152724319466
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither	 3.821466921000537
inclination to see the place again mr gardiner declared his	 3.7587466913517633
upon yourself alone	 3.593499181625392
is that his design in settling here	 3.5664279292121677
yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but that	 3.4990587590529665
hope and i was determined at once to know every thing	 3.493567124399616
herself not at all offended but he continued to apologise for about a	 5.074916219221625
what do you mean hill we have heard nothing from town	 3.2433255180120897
us all which must arise from the public notice of lydias unguarded and	 4.143864524237622
his uncle lord and to the great surprise of all the party when	 3.9828766193235645
matters till they reached the parsonage there shut into her own room	 3.435105611942523
another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with him	 3.6651730558922826
over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked	 3.607946745263876
civil also and say what the occasion required she performed her part	 3.577948428035531
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must	 4.451277538427311
possible that he will marry her	 3.924867098725145
greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally	 3.8712454178751172
confined for time my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer	 3.9281802135133987
when he first came into the room in no countenance was attentive	 3.149408508374463
august 2	 2.0857370267093605
my own such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might	 4.239488846192371
i was never more annoyed the insipidity and yet the noise the	 3.933169600358784
behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure	 3.6117862856185647
be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find	 3.7794641564098503
she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no	 3.511138619932974
jane shook her head	 3.2910066779220544
if you do	 3.75282030587044

would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of	 4.445378920894874
shall now know how to act do not imagine miss bennet that your	 3.866289111157114
we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said	 3.256678442799194
husbands love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their	 3.760676108328094
behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of	 3.964112153266983
defect of his character after all he has been accused of many	 3.7639325064732967
elizabeth was summoned to dinner to the civil enquiries which then	 3.373213591316188
dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr darcys	 5.332800615406402
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his	 3.4567694874296735
the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the	 4.178262949279535
as well as greater certainty absence had increased her desire of seeing	 3.637183100256622
fancied herself nervous the business of her life was to get her	 3.8070788233597086
by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by	 3.377529265680423
what none of you	 3.6617227100215195
could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydias note to his	 3.9042812550696686
arrangement at the waroffice another regiment should be quartered in	 3.7458028990011587
time i am perfectly serious in my refusalyou could not make me	 4.119327690365881
i am sick of mr bingley cried his wife	 3.6308220587555042
if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone	 3.0797228434784687
i like her appearance said elizabeth struck with other ideas she	 3.2269454566991587
pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it she	 4.51950434993747
which yesterday had produced but above all above respect and esteem	 3.139130817407837
side and that if it were it must belong to mr darcy the superior in	 4.600235496099612
never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter	 3.5722681144811257
mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her	 3.892060877563098
his parishioners whenever it were required	 3.225285877227218
including how to make donations to the project gutenberg literary	 3.121157786390026
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a	 3.709780634816828
it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be	 3.9266634594911443
says happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over	 3.3725566762994497
from pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her	 3.398662615758288
it was my brother gardiners drawing up too and i wonder how he came to	 3.1752696539366636
to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision	 4.211841990288492
the latter with regard to new furniture	 3.1690401894499693
complain of it as her husbandit was very strange that he should come	 5.193055071392481
steady gravity	 4.525882587901988
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a	 5.025898682344693
prepare and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real	 3.6748010473096353
extraordinary for on first hearing it mrs bennet sat quite still and	 3.0292064282641284
found wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in	 3.311656322474605
introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an	 3.4649883181186016
i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as	 3.7735374914013953
understanding than i now do of her heart my dear jane mr collins is	 3.7406505764189903
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get	 3.681233821296806
attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself we can all	 4.935341949436751
lived not like the wild young men nowadays who think of nothing but	 3.4810153988318624
the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing	 2.996381314824543
observed my friends behaviour attentively and i could then	 4.285445743997434
would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november	 3.3201284442490158
be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made	 4.63483923675701
oh yeshe was to come there with wickham you know but gracious me	 3.6626830141527473
she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it	 3.8570285528301476
interest in him	 3.457001715751483
naturally lively enough and we all know that wickham has every charm of	 3.7027285397485654
could be more natural than his asking you again he could not help	 3.4146110353314163
about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready	 5.320635298377413
sisters i should not care how proud i was i would keep a pack of	 3.5063389108858236
no indeed i did noti knew nothing at all of lady catherines	 3.5849484456748906
but you will know it when i have told you what happened the very	 3.531368422467865
we have gonewe will recollect what we have seen lakes mountains	 3.5287251386777974
blow as this she was humbled she was grieved she repented though she	 4.9665976333518875
hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her	 3.847201039122896
please read this before you distribute or use this work	 3.3514734245466955
refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discompose	 3.7911357424277234
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion	 4.665644365309263
by herself the path just admitted three mr darcy felt their rudeness	 3.2528756823274714
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of	 3.8009710822183087
oddly	 1.9356690691114107
prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished and their	 3.9011733518833425
speed through the neighbourhood it was borne in the latter with decent	 5.049239612873391
could flatter herself with such an expectation surprise was the least	 3.481515749249871
that is as it happens it does not necessarily follow that a deep	 3.882964027475847
i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied	 3.1698927347485357
compassion on my nerves you tear them to pieces	 4.350758772807593
we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest	 4.1041915898807115
prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were	 3.4677847347621475
wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for	 3.4397308631760612
every hour in his esteem	 3.620281821165235
waterplant there chanced to be a little alteration it originated in	 4.82674021151177
pleasing than any other man	 3.66544555914106
soon dispatched for though dilatory in undertaking business he was	 4.683761342523816
where is your sister said he hastily as he opened the door	 3.51412930628726
her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them	 3.470580447160399
you dare	 4.058247949638147
hertfordshire this winter i will read it to you	 3.570032812856681
hurry and confusion of the following hour had elizabeth been at leisure	 4.78710183292279
miss bennet still looked all amazement elizabeth again and more	 3.2874007665463445
been in the way of procuring	 3.4291765955242326
you shall have it in few words miss bingley sees that her brother is	 3.878431622105005
i have heard from authority which i thought as good that it was	 3.5368908129300363
his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and	 3.6007210232509563
acquaintance in common and though wickham had been little there since	 3.4463665582782292
and writing and looking out of window in his own book room which	 3.345292487062786
the whole party in the liveliest spirits	 3.7421222076234475
hours learn to think of it less than incessantly lady catherine it	 4.06775288820647
want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge	 5.881015023650894
what can it proceed it cannot be for me it cannot be for my sake	 3.6839419084118115
i have said no such thing i am only resolved to act in that manner	 4.197448844554041
i cannot do justice to his kindness he meant to provide for me amply	 3.4033706685332503
found that jane had no intelligence to give the sanguine hope of good	 3.4877814719494284
cannoti have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly	 3.604389669139773
that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and	 3.9773808638933716
it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added	 3.420069123190416
more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the	 3.399994939471014
them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her	 3.3433984714629377
door he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to any one else	 3.57032584036869
mr wickhams society was of material service in dispelling the gloom	 4.257629247780476
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet the	 3.7469933400061772
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word after a short pause	 3.3783817577265793
gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the	 3.862155072665288
in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and	 4.785604231454988
far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his	 3.3094612392656417
trust i am resigned perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my	 3.9609985036121738
commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the	 3.1182403234591773
either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying	 3.3569386819494387
it was evident that he was very much in love with her they saw much to	 3.683814266312391
reflections as must make her unfit for conversation	 4.13912758737966
income	 1.9356690691114107
acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurances of his eagerness to	 4.2935183298176485
her nephew which she had refused to give but unluckily for her	 4.490198175594364
we shall do	 3.527397918273418
from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of	 3.7270707226598225
good natured a girl as ever lived i will go directly to mr bennet and	 3.298141518518036
certainly replied elizabeththere are such people but i hope i am	 3.7652966822686413

with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it	 3.4320023123783296

contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety	 4.439315471616886

this is not to be expected and as to my father i never in my life	 3.6312999149058327
charlottes reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth	 4.014518281522292
heart did whisper that he had done it for her but it was a hope	 4.806643918630404
their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or	 3.535576604578337

you who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy will readily	 3.520100297338652
but it is returned she for mrs long has just been here and she	 3.268191996304407

he brought it with him for us to see	 3.957235877789809

evening by the bye mrs forster and me are such friends and so	 4.0890312010999725
take it on myself	 3.642341985494163
which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming	 3.8695359322062304
income go a good way this is my advice find such a woman as soon as	 3.5531477775650955
my style of writing is very different from yours	 3.137897491915678
again and again it was hardly enough but it pleased her she was even	 3.2688854418065216
should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large	 3.305582361515672
a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and	 4.6343666193386985
regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their	 3.6022628573720104
doubt of your secrecy my sister who is more than ten years my	 3.854168036267637
pray tell your sister that i long to see her	 3.073097599499504
of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which shewed her	 4.246436347309546
not hesitate	 2.996535940179353
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which	 4.275060931302208

mrs gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her	 3.6284924381487382
most creditable to his heart i am sincerely grieved for him and	 5.766101653098116
privilege of universal good will you need not there are few people	 3.5325671844075432
became by proper attention and management less irritable less	 3.826842285196444
and goodhumoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose	 3.3819130404504922
i assure you madam he replied that she does not need such advice	 3.428636281571874
he did not say what she then took a large house in edwardstreet	 3.540515343279016
expressively at lydia but she who never heard nor saw any thing of	 2.9277627496027256
important elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr darcy	 3.5709196493317794
would come in the evening this was agreed to and mrs philips	 3.6363577223016077
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the	 4.890517561212562
were to entertain each other very little was said by either kitty was	 3.240213453345564
complimented her on bearing it so well	 4.06449956846479
but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little	 3.470390004668541
this ever induce me to be explicit	 3.7505409657781206
happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never	 3.7601667239774224
family the far and the near must be relative and depend on many	 3.6693142125613942
him was ecstacy	 3.4051196313176653
might arise in that quarter it distressed her a little and she was	 4.014502768283227
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence	 3.7493676307250943
lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been	 3.9847415706625315
of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this	 4.5075159149348565
can all plague and punish one another teaze himlaugh at	 5.593073460158554
on his cousin allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with	 3.828654455935454
that she might have been mr collinss wife by this time had not it	 3.8027190374446884
daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship	 3.687058472466959
before had been almost an angel of light he was declared to be in debt	 3.7455056022032793
fluctuating but never without an object the mischief of neglect and	 3.604028202889585
the subject by saying but tell me all and every thing about it which	 3.3468406916368023
chapter vii	 1.9302842045940272
know that i am not to be trifled with but however insincere you may	 4.34670846123012
not one	 3.395800988913974
and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room	 4.647125745355615
of happiness were within thirty miles of each other	 3.277749276773184
and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for	 3.548951726885063
as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my	 3.5005198427705264
rings joined now and then in her brothers conversation with miss	 3.5556946709126542

of itoh that abominable mr darcymy fathers opinion of me does	 4.043168938132204

of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i	 3.1336830275634306
he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while	 3.751493235528362
and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it	 4.286219859393645
you dislike him	 3.7604922322799794
jane with such dreadful news it cannot be concealed from any one my	 3.539604364672096
though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall	 4.308836373985501
said for the present	 3.768858016963599
but really considering his descent one could not expect much better	 3.4265291852622735
house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted	 4.070081648124794
that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not	 4.247595398264905
the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same	 3.321917888828555
do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place	 3.9722656657764444
it was some time however before a smile could be extorted from jane	 3.7490978352467925
after a few minutes reflection however she continued i do remember	 3.5642832074664184
temper i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride	 3.2790263378284132
of the regiments approaching removal was indeed beyond expression in	 3.4990133539425603
their visit to rosings mr collins was carefully instructing them in	 4.639124125960111
but circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging	 3.7346771567597234
last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice i	 4.337140770794251
summer	 3.901854281325684
ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship	 3.841656787629374
intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter	 4.254832792317336
and in their brothers manners there was something better than	 3.2732971786567013
shape of a lover to any of them she began at length to recover to	 4.078487452226426
than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs when they	 3.882558310783239
bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy	 3.7353752406552374
was to speak for itself he called it therefore his duty to step	 3.135295122760802
former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that	 3.8245633399956436
do you know mama that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard	 3.422128188355361
some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing	 3.27317759965097
angry but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained	 3.8333010776756877
the judge they are in the same profession you know only in different	 4.026602160871375
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and already had	 3.270557313163154
to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are	 6.393677333771422
elizabeth shook her head over this letter it convinced her that	 3.1192471835729827
impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of	 4.069715019875357
expose himself to such a man mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained	 4.291063268787252
the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good	 4.1224608151249456
but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white	 3.8052893260051595
four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him she endeavoured to	 3.7956351670521915
arising from so illjudged a direction of talents talents which rightly	 4.187020201409942
thing in all this dirt you will not be fit to be seen when you get	 4.47676545424445
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of	 4.096167355674508
tears an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by	 3.522813246526093
your ladyship has declared it to be impossible	 3.300406308617979
relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding yours i	 4.087793534207721

you i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you	 3.3083173098968164
have a right to such very strong local attachment you cannot have	 3.4302941818816874
master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed	 3.5065624582295603
tell you all	 3.512383704358844
the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice	 5.378218096059005

all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds	 3.9022083411969253
i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister said he	 4.2215083875269395
seemed danger of lydias engrossing him entirely for she was a most	 4.092807897790243
yesbut he seemed to like his second better	 3.429559316935897
a novel	 2.5481747321695893
in which you have been brought up	 4.133252434701607
fitzwilliam what do i play next my fingers wait your orders	 3.229623423091698
their visit as they returned except what had particularly interested	 2.986858850356317
which her rank will inevitably excite thus much for my general	 3.9694539688718775
wickham really is we both know that he has been profligate in every	 3.943994908087663
wholly unexpected i had not an idea of it	 4.269561706745886
writing my sisters may write to me they will have nothing else to	 3.5584673976502135
others all that his library afforded	 3.437372980417808
afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately	 3.9999229559269085
spirits oppressively high no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her	 4.704285629441982
one of them does	 3.801952449936359
from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my	 3.3805024053742168
of good humour which youth and beauty generally give had married a	 3.4992068417168056
all copies of project gutenbergtm electronic works in your possession	 3.202060319114391
with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity	 3.9808584385296584
discharged to settle on my niece in addition to her own fortune	 4.381991209706521
they should have opposed their brothers what sister would think	 3.576306982887213
illnature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not	 5.379609254728107
till she could be foundelizabeth could but just affect concern in	 3.8514280528698808
what he ever was	 3.3215916098348996
work such a change as this it is impossible that he should still love	 3.585802842589534
cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea mrs collins	 3.4685968223071573
attempt to place him in an amiable light i am not equal to it wickham	 4.020927015453911
her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her	 3.8145328736633397
form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or	 3.2942206450250096
hope though you have but a short lease	 3.664142578780748

and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear	 3.395403262884779
including obsolete old middleaged and new computers it exists	 3.188343735849746
another very welcome surprise for his chief wish at present was to	 3.219694653504344
why should you be surprised my dear elizado you think it incredible	 3.815104269854996
great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment	 4.7154130961522895
no want of subjectwe may compare our different opinions	 3.502624005665899
mr bennet replied that he had not	 3.6681877047607565
lydias voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open and	 4.453737008707226
fitzwilliam darcy	 3.8971846631376876
these	 4.044876972692124
both had they appeared to be wrong she could no more explain such	 3.5036033900593537
there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her	 4.582919783264625
do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right to be	 3.269215013010095
country	 4.1232553413527455
oh you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general	 4.096948918004107
hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was	 3.0480974864102732
much to any body went away	 3.7797702343068806
body whatever he said was said well and whatever he did done	 3.3257463141878483
copying and distributing project gutenbergtm electronic works to	 3.0108993408268145
winter is over	 3.7914037458307126
his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling that had	 4.334788147980129
yet it should seem by her manner of talking as if she wanted to	 3.5302510910057556
circumstancesand he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me	 5.601471201548267
should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five	 4.269748966751999
for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to	 5.674053103427437
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who	 4.081987512638436
it sounds and she was only sixteen last june my dear jane i am in	 4.43649192183277
energetic	 1.9356690691114107
sorry it went off but these things happen so often a young man such	 3.4513041446919686
into the country to give a ball at netherfield	 3.612036428895017
his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming	 3.640583907521382
never been a favourite with them mr and mrs gardiner could not but be	 3.4286256931187697
her name she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in	 3.270022568522512
will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest	 4.974279160836375
herself and sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction	 4.069777522075796
oh if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in	 3.584046568512747
attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation	 3.306658216907225
elizabeths sake he assisted him farther in his profession lydia was	 4.4367953992834
argument and want to silence this	 2.9169349198190733
this is a parade cried he which does one good it gives such an	 3.250924909426829
table what do you think it is excellent news capital news and about	 3.398115265938366
himself	 3.199711893881445
pride and obsequiousness selfimportance and humility	 3.9093647196619994
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it	 3.705341599626316
the day with them she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying to	 4.422231652080239
application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited	 3.5250744781554113
her aunt now called her to look at a picture she approached and saw	 3.2959794646050438
have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from	 5.100619770168345
jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her	 3.40359586604102
to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect	 3.8046660113608746
their dear friends vulgar relations	 3.215623078545699
ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at	 3.6538345373715226
shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information	 4.249038731366637
mistaken light have given you uneasiness i did not think mrs	 3.7007471874720967
mr wickhams adieus were much more affectionate than his wifes he	 3.1987318711395134
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really	 4.710731795998589

on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a few	 3.5990526768959548
evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to	 4.670012572343626
hereafter her own he had certainly formed such a plan and without	 3.128918601834365
lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to	 3.485078163717805
pleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers and though this	 3.5986806357815033
the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane	 4.544825369467175
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not now be sincere	 3.3117949086517897
to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress for it might be found at	 4.747652875941964
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it she immediately felt	 4.215208365925389
look into the park the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had	 3.7533778097286494
she will never deserve to be happy what a meeting for her when she	 3.8831506619264875
madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some	 4.760941057990904
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings	 4.48561052365175
indeed mr bennet said she it is very hard to think that charlotte	 3.4074170481696053

contents i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink	 3.5692890340834924
i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected	 3.1648065211091083
better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth	 3.5633886200231397
day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late	 3.701008391180787
of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter	 3.474741839916825
lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking	 4.538309484920899
though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady	 3.701673333466941
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire about the court such	 3.9604708907355426

as well to be silent only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth	 3.477191870341142
young ladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a	 3.5906902463039616
hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure lydia came to	 4.137679528327196
that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet	 3.4512005632118443
how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions	 3.0369226569249177
parsonage i should not think any one abiding in it an object of	 3.8261747922380325

research they may be modified and printed and given awayyou may do	 3.8315595006939707
mrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state the very mention of any	 3.5932352476238556
since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love	 3.727062025941073

pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true	 4.072384355534401
with mrs hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in	 3.4925789849775537

the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly	 3.412373838198499
i am far from attributing any part of mr bingleys conduct to design	 3.433273211298814

wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of the sight of	 3.5427478834854282

temper i ever met with i often tell my other girls they are nothing to	 3.0705417528197385
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however	 3.7405524583689633

she smiled but made no answer he repeated the question with some	 3.4015286006813614
that it ought not to be attempted mr darcy has not authorised me to	 4.8928150690091075

her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist	 3.9659958256015195
mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily	 3.7195614235327668

to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source	 3.9540216970977324
it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with	 3.5573539691678033
this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how	 3.7833069276588165

recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of	 4.658656000317816
and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be	 3.2434754876843073

jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he	 4.048666213515611
acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it were it known to the rest	 3.57106112345796

and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of	 3.8899251656957805

other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be	 3.896135155111441
he means to do i am sure i know not but his excessive distress	 4.22891300980163
as soon as ever mr bingley comes my dear said mrs bennet you	 3.2953522775762853
understand	 4.276757376873851
disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to	 3.726445733944745
each of them and in the mean time she went after dinner to shew her	 3.724074675628609
tacit engagement with miss de bourgh are you lost to every feeling of	 3.5172014168030588
claims of duty honour and gratitude you are determined to ruin him in	 3.442910608160032
herself was entirely insensible of the evil elizabeth had frequently	 4.466146941402144
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence she was convinced that	 3.0798238887323923
return mr bennets visit and determining when they should ask him to	 3.5363582541039027
elizabeth to hunsford she had not at first thought very seriously of	 3.7843083325522264
well well and so mr bingley is coming down sister for mrs	 3.3719703208612857
elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not	 3.607372048642864
i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one but i always speak	 4.531988663992114
never saw in the whole course of my life	 3.431427456127862
to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies	 5.027278987434811
high she immediately said	 3.4291129714725734
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy may i ask	 5.529910491074194
or	 3.7845285598540483
only exceedingly shy she found it difficult to obtain even a word from	 3.5563415757738954
bingleys appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all	 3.1966011628507616
you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my	 3.551604981844889
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject day after	 3.498126506703509
amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be	 4.3626777947270465
marry and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but	 3.4598820714324594
conversation passed by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom	 4.200947842849244
at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never	 3.7638612576130535
as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think	 3.0470418478555596

him capable of it	 3.6848149155734533
her voice was weak and her manner affectedelizabeth was in agonies	 4.9030371397764245
elizabeth looked archly and turned away her resistance had not	 3.7716811550951257
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them	 4.337324390953684
make way for her and live to see her take my place in it	 3.612409974370135
dishonesty i must call it	 3.665555202570627
should be equally unreserved was impossible elizabeth could never	 3.504435420876136
thousand a year and very likely more tis as good as a lord and a	 3.226508057014785
calculation are heavy indeed but perhaps added he stopping in his	 3.873793367402585
aunts where his regret and vexation and the concern of every body was	 3.9964347765997337
reasonable to be sure you knew no actual good of mebut nobody thinks	 3.53742246750661
unappeasable you are very cautious i suppose as to its being	 3.7070178101273132
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeths mind	 3.7150044096680768
repaid	 1.9356690691114107
but my dear you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into	 3.1957587989921286

inconveniencescheerfulness to enhance every pleasureand affection	 3.4654687672655538
that is all settled repeated the other as she ran into her room to	 2.972031450112857
was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said thanking her	 3.603438843334505
such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at	 4.994238663648147

the girls stared at their father mrs bennet said only nonsense	 3.232259114297831
to pemberley therefore they were to go	 3.6182568733788063
withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which	 3.9623264750014635
rosings a lively imagination soon settled it all	 3.4433560432867263
is my father in town	 3.3123765144245625
and respectability which he will probably never reach when she thought	 3.9886580026856584
you never see a fault in any body all the world are good and agreeable	 4.268154928055709
i am sure why janeyou never dropt a word of this you sly thing	 3.3430352681886366
inquiries on the same subject of bingley jane met her with a smile of	 3.375518756685463
and blushed again with shame and vexation she could not help frequently	 4.352661951973602
foolish things that were said in the morning and yet upon my honour i	 3.54644810285147
younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he	 3.442145198912554
your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of	 3.121436035695696
when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i	 3.509968575090644
remember it myself	 3.769245581953856
engaged with mr darcy that they scarcely ever saw him i found that	 3.617792397735841
gentleman had called on business on saturday he came again your	 3.2951840462102497
measure to his kindness we are persuaded that he has pledged himself	 3.723371615115874
gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her	 4.018441197531483
him he now wished it more than ever had he done his duty in that	 3.07863513830518
but darcy was clever he was at the same time haughty reserved and	 4.084951426770585
spot mr denny addressed them directly and entreated permission to	 3.1225412581521126
an application to her nephew and how he might take a similar	 3.4672589591987344
you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your	 3.426765852109379
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it	 4.138163721492226
mama cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and captain	 3.2714031202003357
condescension arose to receive them and as mrs collins had settled it	 3.595801893562547
detained first by the civility of mr collins whose inquiries after	 3.6537682226489117
part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree	 3.364605363556966
imaginary but still he would be her husbandwithout thinking highly	 3.258390291649577
attention to the imperfection of the performance when you told mrs	 4.7131379917374625
she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road	 4.256136059049864
an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr	 4.618669225761531
breakfast the next morning that you have ordered a good dinner today	 4.778478104788363
other reply to elizabeths salutation than a slight inclination of the	 3.359081379304353
late to be saving mrs bennet had no turn for economy and her	 5.005764505289994
intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither	 3.31194061577421
i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and tell the	 3.874113341821271
you keep winking at me for what am i to do	 3.4815488386710567
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had	 3.304859135014883
always within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or the	 4.507604784725097
unable to sit alone mary was obliged to mix more with the world but	 3.6355918957842865
had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have	 3.3121719345117073
would rather have cried her father had most cruelly mortified her by	 4.683403529539153
can you deny that you have done it she repeated	 3.6601416648761718
elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the	 4.122107963699546
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting it would surely be much	 4.0135934841125955
elopement i know it all that the young mans marrying her was a	 3.966896122473435
saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their	 3.6426228628545014
jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as	 3.784040412434187
look for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off his	 3.686403941203137
opposite the front of his house it was a handsome modern building well	 3.7564729198321443
great comfort to them in their hours of freedom their other aunt also	 3.6071278423793496
in your eyes i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life	 3.7216478931152657
it it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence	 4.650533835966301
to mr darcy it was welcome intelligenceelizabeth had been at	 4.055467312335185
had been valued by his friend here was knowledge in which no one could	 3.551779515729214
openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be	 3.5400381251062205
said mrs bennet to her husband and all the others equally well	 4.211118712644229
delight but we considered it we talked of it as impossible and do you	 3.3536952533187665
rosings	 3.796913927760974
militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship	 3.8445817703796346
bennet was not so well pleased with it lydias being settled in the	 3.5903491558369023
own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to	 3.9681172214169917
yesthat is what makes it amusing had they fixed on any other man	 3.7959863484627068
enough each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their	 3.662473429247486
pemberley was now georgianas home and the attachment of the sisters	 3.771523868938347
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly	 3.1248123793129685
credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the	 3.8591478135258006
made an offer to lizzy and she will not have him	 3.71944766739434
listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she	 3.7133901285491935
deal counteracted by the selfconceit of a weak head living in	 4.289017465120262
joy	 4.89007621193599
then after a short silence he continued lizzy i bear you no	 3.253202843520253
was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one	 4.152059358663797
ill	 4.084723354825738
i can readily believe answered he gravely that report may vary	 3.2972044443245982
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence it was absolutely	 3.6186521611556177
not for the entail i should not mind it	 5.168036499632227
morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him	 4.903915517122501
late mr darcys steward let me recommend you however as a friend	 3.4481344338937827
hope it why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the	 4.058796813601123
set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked	 3.3417846655141936
lydias intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten every sister	 3.3061093865786444
third time i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just	 3.9209407929739655
not that you are an adept in the science yourself mr darcy	 4.503465955689497
means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and	 4.156004694626046
aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she	 4.948289447658064
mr bennets emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such	 3.4219492369384694
as mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she	 3.6947388419277543
as i canor perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away	 3.8831841579584707
misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the	 3.8455741714174905
about	 3.334859363579144
has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has	 3.418853623791572
kindness on a more grateful object	 3.506983943415749
i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she your	 3.810981139396522
reflections is a very common failing i believe by all that i have	 4.015444316610017
girls had been on the point of marriage and after all there was nothing	 3.6056615364687867
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would	 3.4856798022750053
and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least	 4.149426832747219
his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bennet his marriage was	 3.9367807958223815
compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an	 5.074737691654921
be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done	 4.867615143466619
that mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn	 3.5196076368870126
yes it has often led him to be liberal and generousto give his	 4.411830320694076
myself and of mr wickham too he shall not be in love with me if i	 4.263360023105272
again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to	 3.8699482538110663
than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring	 3.949699997417711
a conceited pompous narrowminded silly man you know he is as well	 3.939032617133285
tell me once for all are you engaged to him	 3.206832532744842
conceal from her his share in lydias marriage all was acknowledged	 3.096361172388878

esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his	 3.5744636903678932
i know little of the game at present said he but i shall be glad	 4.652554060322576

your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit	 3.5541263111434445
reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last	 3.461882883042748
pemberley house is a powerful motive he has also brotherly pride	 3.752439898349366
inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to	 3.7363411802536155
william is mr bingleyis not he so much the man of fashion so	 4.096943302069949

to the late mr darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the	 3.5804486620286435
bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out	 3.7631015342099254
for heavens sake madam speak lowerwhat advantage can it be to you	 3.2605548042894332
illtempered man wickham only shook his head	 2.9897030253205483

different walks i think she will be pleased with the hermitage	 3.772449928735244
was a most humiliating pictureand to the pang of a friend disgracing	 4.357571426699605

separation to the rest of the family they paid little attention	 3.5351878769103346
poor lydias situation must at best be bad enough but that it was no	 3.6708830144515137

beauty mrs long said so too for i asked her whether you did not and	 3.407881860051205
the case and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed	 3.6572216559868953
neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we	 3.8295074531957005
the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable	 3.5542443219371886
proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone	 4.104751830499124
the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual	 2.9594842789122864
for her own visit there to know the rest	 3.3278536869357462

my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the	 5.101456202654171
living i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her	 4.115848202979147
upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of	 4.077321144156342
the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be	 3.4028793824866455
if i have i shall be the last person to confess it	 3.8966563897163407
probable consequence of her allusions to mr wickham and rejoiced in	 5.957863484718662
but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so ill of	 3.270506701424645
without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now	 4.419592773997954
reserve can be answerable for the event but in spite of all this	 4.683022753745034
nothing greaterhe carved and ate and praised with delighted	 5.376449266373925
either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at	 5.104533085745617
the pianoforte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead	 3.7707465842417567
reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her	 3.336190502336453
i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her	 3.5945994963862344
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the	 3.5869286122282102
be traced to prideand pride has often been his best friend it has	 3.8839129700082835
that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot	 3.199223058166115
emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world	 3.904514475125824
the dupe of miss bingleys pretended regard	 3.6820588413780966
looked that way	 3.7393845297519213
some daydo your sisters play and sing	 3.45475024457625
was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room all	 4.119522034761804
that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure that	 3.7750124788424197
upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get	 3.0793682602662003
	 3.376763238557606
i have not already heard give me farther particulars what did colonel	 2.990779655889579
very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so	 4.333287331843609
others and between her and mrs gardiner with occasional help from	 3.6658754044791664
otherabout eight years ago	 3.0789407309774126
me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying	 3.9229065254802418
offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs collins and myself on	 3.5165839747823284
manoeuvre of mrs bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of	 4.146398474705586
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness	 3.1507636445818417
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentlemans	 3.4896152190807697
agreeable but elizabeth less clearsighted perhaps in his case than	 3.2736748275509524
elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great	 3.883004927849866
people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance	 3.2049557828955795
what he said of mr darcys indifference and she could do nothing but	 3.302175674650289
strikingly alteredwhat could it mean that he should even speak to	 3.6043330463805736
treat in such a manner the godson the friend the favourite of his	 3.805427421957241
situation and temper consider mr collinss respectability and	 3.310025210523482
little information and uncertain temper when she was discontented she	 3.5663828712867454
would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men he took leave	 3.942534063681006
did whether he would think it proper to join in the evenings	 3.5397268197903475
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the	 4.515919066843049
preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right	 4.3165938472130945
without constant practice i have told miss bennet several times that	 3.9266127880114614
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer	 4.468891901085332
brittle than it is beautifuland that she cannot be too much guarded	 3.981373682458038
about pretty much for my part i am inclined to believe it all mr	 3.8706646808852754
be for one of them sir william and lady lucas are determined to go	 3.5825692243311127
would not listen therefore to her daughters proposal of being carried	 3.6891090902028485
well lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so the	 3.1701778807341565
rosings rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must wait	 5.236426029903991
mr gardiner whose manners were easy and pleasant encouraged her	 3.101961791042014
first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would	 4.570978566923094
cookery was owing but here he was set right by mrs bennet who assured	 3.5264627825139736
i see no occasion for that you and the girls may go or you may send	 3.399782245544946
from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young	 3.6639708204392383
redistribution	 1.9356690691114107
evident enough	 4.505720438297037
consequence to begin the acquaintancemr collins listened to her	 3.2598796657834863
mrs bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such	 4.145065602620283
went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and	 3.744406807720701
you began the evening well charlotte said mrs bennet with civil	 3.8180524998062437
her not objecting does not justify him it only shews her being	 4.590376753810118
chapter xxii	 1.9302842045940272
scarcely give them a hearing they were ignorant idle and vain while	 3.171482305010793
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and	 3.0281129037414978
first you may remember	 3.4335193568438775
glowing with the warmth of exercise	 2.8496763574341704
called out	 3.625538051903521
what jane felt for bingley her astonishment at his comingat his	 3.862414547044055
i suspected as much replied elizabeth but how did he account for	 3.4083360035624617
assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be	 4.126565873357873
to protect the project gutenbergtm mission of promoting the free	 4.591757049337831
habit of saying made no mention of the business that had taken him	 3.310855507006972
oh cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way	 4.423150743620271
and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage	 3.686182890600239
colour it was many months since she had mentioned his name to	 3.392733465575328
they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his	 3.8148257731284163
much more than to any other person in the room	 3.4605326564856327
looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for darcy to leave her	 3.665539080705916
and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after	 3.728959411730796
actually married you cannot greatly err you must write again very	 3.8315956183026953
was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth when they	 4.281161851106466
astonished her husband and daughters	 4.30857537492902
may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before at present i will	 3.563769316719407
gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved	 4.624584592692594
i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility mr darcy would	 3.6919080094418972
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great she knew not how to	 3.2006058620024778
i am not	 3.1309731118263358
may i ask to what these questions tend	 2.920112303874707
acquaintance are connected wickham passed all his youth there you	 3.7286285074813335
from their own feelings and his servants report without any reference	 3.3111800494883483
less his son might have borne with me better but his fathers uncommon	 3.9947336725311353
might not unreasonably have alarmed her she had dressed with more than	 5.235834463475246
the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would	 3.5703753560737415
with others of the officers at longbourn and so little was elizabeth	 3.997376707695447
seemed a gulf impassable between them had lydias marriage been	 4.47214097532141
chapter vi	 1.9302842045940272
housekeeping i dare say	 3.3112733529100993
ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject mr	 3.2667447052010687
why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that	 4.588881542672519
some minutes in silence and at last on the young ladys whispering	 3.578924488796455
but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be	 3.909875954477391
mutual desire of never meeting again	 3.1318868622914935
why my dear you must know mrs long says that netherfield is taken	 3.4699100253311874
such recollection befriended her she could see him instantly before	 4.147396442997226
she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup	 4.028631010784919
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations	 3.5867779078421376
coarseness of expression herself the coarseness of the sentiment	 3.5082220196635316
himself at her feet he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins	 4.0262419466205674
uncivil she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all	 3.2360211483462162
of threadbare morality to listen to catherine and lydia had	 3.7461708344476894
friend had any intention of making one in the croud but of that i	 4.298523873472776
opinion my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light	 3.8318938291119817
up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks	 4.282111325356121
but you do not know all i will read you the passage which	 4.226324400604331
she be as tall as i am	 3.72667521258757
round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and	 3.9370933469829352
since we see every day that where there is affection young people are	 3.231018568365074
answered this description when mr hurst called them to order with	 4.1328168113928
the rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of mrs forster	 4.237844008086856
might possibly get a settled family there but perhaps mr bingley did	 3.034818809340679
elizabeths congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a	 4.998704038440277
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared	 3.4288930879592447
discover it too	 3.4223847912362473
she is happy then said her father drily and her residence there	 4.261006804727583
pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest	 3.0408562429391277

elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for	 3.6279571077976516
him replied the other elizabeth thought this was going pretty far	 3.312499439496197
unconcern oh but there were two or three much uglier in the shop and	 4.071825563115783
library	 4.226332646556149
of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the	 3.749028201219659
outstrip them they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy	 3.3351123357145083
through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving mr	 4.105760139946674
enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word	 3.842477624270931
are not worth a regret come let me see the list of the pitiful fellows	 3.3291025128894165
when mr bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual	 3.643940621175359
leave to say very impolitic toofor it is provoking me to retaliate	 5.559059151274403
design of engaging my affection it is only that he is blessed with	 3.9887448716863476
come to hunsford	 3.412278863679758
been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way i wonder who first	 4.088158897034045
humoured lively and i never saw such happy mannersso much ease	 3.623329569648184
was at netherfield i hope your plans in favour of the shire will	 3.44747358630093
for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a great	 4.0342012996922865
her when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy who took	 3.872943955641839
my dear dear lydia she cried this is delightful indeedshe will	 3.104532063095893
to improve myself for in my situation of life mrs philips was	 3.2528322376745407
seek to clear one without involving the other	 3.563840763636756
once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own till the next	 3.708692635113639
fancy the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers she	 4.92217624931408
suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight	 3.6400755182157596
assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to	 4.756687583757422
unreasonable but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity	 4.145878323559759
darcy only entered the room	 3.1460615146325823
daughter	 3.9024831684958836
on reaching the house they were shewn through the hall into the saloon	 3.5820033881958127
to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mothers ungracious and	 3.4161377931967767
very proudas a child she was affectionate and pleasing and	 3.1269710884631086
could	 3.9836866131040654
delight which words could but poorly express every sentence of	 3.2446996443102663
with this ebook or online at <URL>	 2.699521710981084
her equally avoid the name of his friend but now she would no longer	 3.591049153423846
treated you too and then when we came away it was such fun i thought	 3.6729624924056843
not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to	 3.4409545121057774
was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased	 3.1940438047023236
that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be	 3.9200762508301623
pause added	 3.732119216833713
the world perhaps other people have said so before but not one	 3.190787782255407
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen	 3.7377356600054323
revolted in his offer to herself what will be his surprise thought	 3.309946128932494
and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of	 3.8099357646357483
exaggeration the shocking rudeness of mr darcy	 3.369428479162996
ceased speaking replied thus	 3.667660727893315
principal object he was then he said on his way to longbourn on	 3.7823877270465647
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners	 3.8207959364142656
much said her aunt a place too with which so many of your	 3.5361318137181756
and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would	 3.108175695336883
more foolish than his daughter	 3.614244010886485
visit	 4.135168152248793
found out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street	 3.54994683497044
talking of why he has four or five thousand ayear and very likely	 3.400462134275851
the next ball we meet with great pleasure i shall send for my	 3.440749677331229
within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets	 3.3152049501253145

your fatherpardon meit pains me to offend you but amidst	 5.711300394448566
of it again to anybody i told my sister philips so the other day but i	 3.835074502224179
was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their	 3.607252095745947
i hope not so imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be	 4.43704934837862
between charlotte and miss de bourghthe former of whom was engaged in	 3.4308736916708362
little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance	 4.901324074055374
perhaps that is not possible for any one but it has been the study of	 4.064575863195744
to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the	 4.320383552324159

bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy	 3.985751553164997
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful my dear dear	 3.247234482686623
intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours	 3.3103977320458062

that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me	 4.028128872158104
trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which	 6.520052895224478

more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account	 3.879805167041756
